      "====================================\n",
      "So, when you decide to start a business with someone, you have a big job ahead of you. Typically, people who start a business together need to plan for a relationship that might last about 10 years. That's a big step to take with someone you might have only known for a few months, or even just in the work world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's tricky because the only real examples of this type of long-term partnership that you might have seen before are the ones between our moms and dads. So, let's take a quick look at research about successful marriages to help us understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's this guy named John Gottman who studies marriages. He's pretty well-known and has been talked about in a few different places. He has an interesting skill - he can watch a couple argue about something for 15 minutes and then predict with 85% accuracy whether they'll still be married four years later. If he watches them for an hour and also asks about their plans and hopes, his prediction rate jumps to 94%.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shows videos of these couples to different experts like priests, psychologists, and counselors, and even people who are happily married. Yet none of them can predict whether the couple will last as well as John can. \n",
      "\n",
      "He noticed something: how a couple argues can predict how long they will stay together. Surprisingly, he found that it's not about never fighting. Everybody fights, over the same things usually: money, children, intimacy, time, jealousy, and in-laws. Most of the time, they argue about what to do with their free time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And guess what? The same things can cause disagreements when you're starting a business with someone. These are all things you and your business partners might end up arguing about.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if we know everyone has disagreements and we can predict what they will be about, we can prepare for those disagreements. We can plan how to handle those situations. This could be the key to making sure we continue to work together on our passion projects.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Let's talk about how to deal with problems in teamwork. John Gottman found four main things we should stay away from when we have disagreements. Here they are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Criticism: Picture this. You are worried about a work issue, maybe a glitch that needs fixing pronto! You share your fears, but instead of addressing it, someone brings up an unrelated issue. Like the fact that you leave a lot dishes in the sink. Criticizing or bringing up other issues rather than focusing on the problem at hand is not helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Insulting: This one's simple. You voice your worries about the glitch, actually expecting a productive discussion. But, another person says something mean to you. Personal attacks won't fix matters. Remember, we are in a work setting - taking things personally is not fruitful.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Not taking responsibility: Imagine, there's a problem but someone fails to accept they've a part in it, thus delaying the solution. In their eyes, they've done nothing wrong so they see no problem. As a result, there's roadblocks to finding solutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Avoiding problems: This is dangerous. Imagine raising a problem only for the other person to walk away instead of engaging in a conversation. Ignoring the problem will not bring any resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "These four points should help us understand what to avoid when faced with disagreements at work. Remember, the aim should always be to find a resolution, not create more problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Okay, let's take that long explanation and make it much simpler. So, you're making a new business or startup, right? With your business partner, it's important to make a clear plan right from the start. You want to avoid problems, right? There are four things you can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you can \"divide and conquer\". This just means deciding who is in charge of what parts of the business, right from the beginning. That way, if there's a problem in a certain part of the business, it's obvious who should handle it. This can help avoid arguments and misunderstandings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't worry too much about competition at the start. It usually doesn't cause problems until you're further along. As you go on, you'll assign more and more roles and whoever is in charge of that area will handle problems as they pop up.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if things get out of control? Well, after you divide up the tasks, it's important to know what a win looks like and what a failure looks like. You need to decide when to step in and help someone with their part. Also, you need to decide how well something needs to be going before you leave it alone and let the person in charge do their thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good times to step in could be once you've gathered the money you need or if your work is being done on time. Bad times could be when you need to stop everything and talk about a big problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you have to have a serious talk, it's important not to get angry or emotional. It can stop you from thinking clearly. Try to set these rules early. It's much easier to talk about difficult things when you're calm and not upset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, remember that in most situations, the final decision comes from the head of the company, the CEO. If there's a problem with the CEO, it's the job of the board. At the start, the board is often just the founders, so you must work it out together. That's your second defense against problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Okay, here's a simpler way to understand that. When working with others, especially someone like a business partner, it's really important to know not only yourself, but also them. This can help avoid misunderstandings.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's some good research from the 1960s that said people have different ways of handling relationships. There are mainly three types. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, there's a group of people who are happy making friends, relying on others, and letting others rely on them. They're okay with sharing feelings and don't mind when others do the same. This is called a 'secure' style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, there are those who feel they don't get enough love and want to hold on to people. They need others to always confirm they love them or want to be with them. This is the 'anxious' style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, there are people who find making friends tough. Sometimes they just want to run away because it's scary, or they're worried about messing up. This is the 'avoidant' style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing your business partner's style and your own can help you understand and fix any issues that come up. Funny enough, most people are either anxious or avoidant, and these two types usually end up together. This means one person needs space to think things through, while the other needs to be reassured all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't understand what the other person needs, you'll have trouble working together. You both will need to make some changes to make it work. There are many good books and a nice webpage on Wikipedia about these styles. There's also a helpful video on YouTube by School of Life that talks about this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, if you're with someone who is the opposite type, you have to do some extra work. If you're an anxious type and the other person is an avoidant type, understand that they need space. It doesn't mean they're leaving forever. If you're an avoidant type with an anxious type, let them know if you need space. Just say something like, \"I need a bit of time to think about this. We'll talk about it soon.\" And be sure to come back when you said you would.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Sure, happy to make this easier to understand!\n",
      "\n",
      "There may come a time we need to sort out our ideas, and having a written process to do so will help. It'll keep things fair and safe. It's good to set up these rules when everyone is calm and clear-headed. Why? Because when we're mad or emotional, we might not think straight. We may say things we don't mean, and that can lead to bigger problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good example can be seen with a company called Mater. They prepared a simple list on how to handle disagreements. It's a clear guide on what to do when we have different views. It lists different choices, who made the final call, what the decision was, when it was made, and why. When the guide is ready, we don't need to worry when disagreements come up. We just need to fill out this list and it will steer us in the right direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many ways to do this, and you don't need to copy Mater's exact method. Maybe you decide that if there's a strong disagreement, you'll toss a coin to make the decision. The main thing is that the rules are set up beforehand. So, when you're upset, you can just say, \"Alright, we have a plan for this,\" and follow your process. It might suggest taking a short break, eating a sandwich, or even taking a nap before coming back to talk things over. It's all about finding a way that makes sense for everyone involved.\n",

      "====================================\n",
      "Let's make this simple. When you both settle on a plan, it keeps things pleasant. So, to avoid getting upset with one another, find a way to speak that's not scary or hurtful. There's a wonderful book about this, 'Nonviolent Communication' by Marshall Rosenberg. It's all about being honest without being mean or putting others down.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a special way to do this that might seem different if you're not used to talking about feelings. When you want to point out an issue, try saying it like this: \"I saw this thing, it made me feel like this because I wanted this. Can you do this?\". It's not easy to master, but it's proven very helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are four parts to this way of communicating. Let's talk about each part:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Observation**: start with something real, not an opinion. For example, instead of saying someone's lazy, say \"You said you'd send the document last week but I haven't gotten it yet.\" Stick to facts, not opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Emotion**: next, talk about how the thing you saw made you feel. For example, \"after not getting the document, I felt frustrated.\" Be careful not to mix up feelings and thoughts - feeling \"frustrated\" is valid, but saying \"I feel like you're not taking this seriously\" is actually a thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Need**: understanding why you felt the way you did can often be linked to a basic need. Was it because you missed out on something? Try to figure out what it was you were missing. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Request**: finally, suggest a way to improve the situation. For instance, asking someone to turn up on time rather than simply saying \"be more respectful\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Use these steps next time you have small issues to talk about. It's hard, but practicing will make it easier. If you want more tips, there's a great article by Dave Bailey about how to give useful feedback.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Sometimes when making a program, we have to take shortcuts to get things done faster. But we know that these quick fixes might cause problems later on. This is called \"technical debt.\" Just like with programming, we can also have \"emotional debt\" in our relationships. That's when we ignore small issues, which can later become big problems. It's best to fix these issues as soon as they come up.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is also true in marriages, according to research by a person named John Gottman. He observed that couples who are happy deal with issues straight away, even if they're small. They never let a problem get bigger by ignoring it. For example, they might say, \"Could you please close your mouth while you're eating? It's disturbing me a bit.\" They deal with issues quickly and kindly. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is similar to running a business with a partner. If something is bothering you, it's better to talk about it as soon as it comes up. That way, small issues won't turn into big ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how do you start doing this? You need to practice. There's a group called YC that talks about three levels of conversations. Level one is simple chats where you exchange facts. Level two involves sharing feelings about things. Level three is about the relationship between two people. In this level, you talk about what's going on right now and why it's important. \n",
      "\n",
      "Doing a startup involves a lot of these level-three talks. That's because many important things need to be discussed within a team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few topics that are good to discuss: Short-term goals, metrics you're using and whether you're meeting your goals. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to make sure everyone knows who's in charge of what. If there's any disagreement, it's good to talk about it and sort it out. \n",
      "\n",
      "You also need to check whether the work is divided in the best way between the team members. Everyone needs to be dedicated and motivated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, you also need to discuss how you'll provide feedback to each other and work out any emotional debt. You need a system to deal with these issues in an honest manner. \n",
      "\n",
      "So to wrap things up, it's important to have regular talks about how things are going in your startup. Clear communication helps prevent small problems from becoming big issues.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "In our company, we're going to simplify the way we all work together. Everyone has disagreements sometimes, so it's important to have a plan. We need to understand each other's ways of connecting, our roles, and our goals. This is best done before any feelings get involved—think of it like making a decision when you're clear-headed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should use peaceful ways to share open and honest thoughts, without blaming each other. And, we should manage our feelings on a regular basis. This is the best way to prevent small issues from becoming big ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting now, let's not be afraid to discuss tough topics. I'm sure there are things that two, three, four, or even more of us aren't speaking openly about. Thank you very much! Now, why don't we all have a chat with one another?\n",

    "How does caffeine keep us awake? - Hanan Qasim\n",
    "Over 100,000 metric tons\n",
    "of caffeine are consumed around the world every year. That's equivalent to the weight\n",
    "of 14 Eiffel Towers. Most of this caffeine is consumed\n",
    "in coffee and tea, but it's also ingested in some sodas, chocolate, caffeine pills, and even beverages labeled decaf. Caffeine helps us feel alert,\n",
    "focused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,\n",
    "and make us feel anxious. It's the world most widely used drug. So how does it keep us awake? Caffeine evolved in plants where\n",
    "it serves a few purposes. In high doses, as it's found in the leaves\n",
    "and seeds of certain species, it's toxic to insects. But when they consume it in lower doses,\n",
    "as it's found in nectar, it can actually help them remember\n",
    "and revisit flowers. In the human body, caffeine acts as a\n",
    "stimulant for the central nervous system. It keeps us awake by blocking one of\n",
    "the body's key sleep-inducing molecules, a substance called adenosine. Your body needs a constant supply\n",
    "of energy, which it gets by breaking down\n",
    "a high-energy molecule called ATP. In the process, it liberates adenosine,\n",
    "ATP's chemical backbone. Neurons in your brain have receptors\n",
    "perfectly tailored to this molecule. When adenosine docks to these receptors, it activates a cascade \n",
    "of biochemical reactions that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important\n",
    "brain-signaling molecules. In other words, you get sleepy. Caffeine is what's called an adenosine\n",
    "receptor antagonist. That means it derails this process\n",
    "of slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine and adenosine have a similar\n",
    "molecular structure, close enough that caffeine can wedge into\n",
    "the adenosine receptors, but not close enough to activate them. To summarize, \n",
    "adenosine inhibits your neurons. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,\n",
    "so it stimulates you. Caffeine can also boost positive feelings. In some neurons, the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors \n",
    "for another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain\n",
    "is to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these\n",
    "paired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine\n",
    "to fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,\n",
    "it doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects\n",
    "on adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too,\n",
    "reducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,\n",
    "and some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body's\n",
    "ability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes \n",
    "an unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below\n",
    "a certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine's effects\n",
    "are so helpful. It might make you feel better\n",
    "and more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate\n",
    "and blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages\n",
    "caffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body\n",
    "that have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular\n",
    "consumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors \n",

    "The myth of Prometheus - Iseult Gillespie\n",
    "Before the creation of humanity, the Greek gods won a great battle against \n",
    "a race of giants called the Titans. Most Titans were destroyed or\n",
    "driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,\n",
    "whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus\n",
    "to fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating \n",
    "all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts\n",
    "of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability \n",
    "to move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped\n",
    "the first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods, but Zeus decreed \n",
    "they were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants \n",
    "of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient\n",
    "creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude\n",
    "creations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide\n",
    "how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick\n",
    "that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it\n",
    "into two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed \n",
    "the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones\n",
    "under a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly\n",
    "best portion for himself, he was outraged \n",
    "at Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use\n",
    "of fire on Earth, whether to cook meat \n",
    "or for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see\n",
    "his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus\n",
    "to steal fire from the workshop \n",
    "of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk\n",
    "and brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness\n",
    "nature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care \n",
    "for themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons\n",
    "and wage war. Prometheus's flames acted as a catalyst\n",
    "for the rapid progression of civilization. When Zeus looked down at this scene,\n",
    "he realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again\n",
    "wounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, Zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained\n",
    "to a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture\n",
    "who would tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back\n",
    "to be attacked again in the morning. Although Prometheus remained \n",
    "in perpetual agony, he never expressed regret \n",
    "at his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression\n",
    "made him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous\n",
    "and inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress,\n",
    "and power he brought to human hands. He's also a recurring figure\n",
    "in art and literature. In Percy Bysshe Shelley's\n",
    "lyrical drama \"Prometheus Unbound,\" the author imagines Prometheus\n",
    "as a romantic hero who escapes and continues to spread\n",
    "empathy and knowledge. Of his protagonist, Shelley wrote, \"Prometheus is the type \n",
    "of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest \n",
    "and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends.\" His wife Mary envisaged Prometheus\n",
    "as a more cautionary figure and subtitled her novel\n",

    "# History of Bugs in Programs\n",
    "In the world of computers, a 'bug' is a fancy word for a mistake or problem in a program. Bugs make programs act in ways we didn't expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The First Bug?\n",
    "A long time ago, in 1947, a real-life moth (yes, the flying kind!) got stuck inside a computer. This caused the machine to go haywire. The engineers who found it joked that they \"debugged\" the computer by removing the moth. That's the archaic story how the term 'bug' came into the world of computing! But did it, really?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before computers looked like the machines we know today, people used the term 'bug' to describe glitches and hitches in electrical systems. Thomas Edison, the famous inventor, even mentioned \"bugs\" in his writings from the 1870s!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Expanding World of Bugs:\n",
    "As computers evolved, so did bugs. From simple mechanical glitches, bugs grew into complex software issues. They weren't just pesky problems but started influencing big events:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)**: A tiny bug in its software caused this European rocket to explode shortly after its launch. Ouch!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Y2K Bug**: As the world approached the year 2000, there was a global panic about computers not recognizing '00' as the year 2000 but as 1900. Thankfully, massive efforts debugged the potential mess!\n",

    "# First Karel Program\n",
    "Let's write your first Karel program, you know all the commands already. Imagine that Karel lives in the world below\n",
    "\n",
    "![World before](/images/intro-to-programming-js-en/4_first_program_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You job is to write program, where Karel will take the beeper on the (2,1) corner, will put it on the (4,2) corner and finish working on (5,2). After program execution world should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![World after](/images/intro-to-programming-js-en/4_first_program_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy enough with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "move\n",
    "pickBeeper\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "move\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "move\n",
    "move\n",
    "putBeeper\n",
    "move\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But, this is not a program yet. This is the instruction to solve the problem, but it's for humans to understand not for Karel. This is not a program this is an algorithm. Let's turn it to program. To do this we must turn all the commands into the **functions**. Basically **functions** are commands that could be executed. To do that we will just need to add `();` symbols at the end of all the commands. That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "move();\n",
    "pickBeeper();\n",
    "turnLeft();\n",
    "move();\n",

    "# `for` Loop in Karel\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases we need to repeat some Karel commands several times, We could copy and paste the commands, but it's way better to use the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally copy and pasting the code is not a good idea, we end up with the same code in different places. Which makes code changes tricky and error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume Karel is on the corner of the first street and first avenue - or coordinates (1,1). We want to pick a beeper that is on coordinates(100,1). Pretty straightforward right? We have to write a program with 99 `move();`s and a single `pickBeeper();` at the end. But copying `move();` that many times is quite time-taking and in the process we might miscount add an extra `move();` or miss one. The good news is we can use `for` loop and do it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < some_number; i++) {\n",
    "    Commands that we want to repeat\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loop consists of 2 parts the header and the body. The header defines number of iterations - or how many times you want to repeat something. And the body defines what you want to repeat - a set of instructions that will be repeated several times. Let's do not dwell on the exact meaning of the `for (let i = 0; i < some_number; i++)` the only thing interesting here is the `some_number` where you can write the actual number - how many times you want to repeat the instructions. And inside the `for` loop or in the body you can write the actual set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the program to solve our stated problem goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < 99; i++) {\n",
    "    move();\n",
    "}\n",
    "pickBeeper();\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you notices we used tab inside the `for` loop to make clearer for the code reader that `move();` part of the `for` loop's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Several instructions in `for`\n",
    "Of course we can put several instructions inside the `for` loop. In this case `for` loop executes these set of instructions one by one on each iterations. And the number of iterations is determined in the header of the loop. You can imagine that `for` loop just copies whatever it has inside and pastes it several times. So the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n",
    "    move();\n",
    "    turnLeft();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is exactly the same as the code:\n",

    "```js\n",
    "move();\n",
    "turnLeft();\n",
    "move();\n",
    "turnLeft();\n",
    "move();\n",
    "turnLeft();\n",

and then if you come. up with the idea together. and perhaps you fundraise together then. you\\'ll have collective ownership that. it\\'s your idea and it\\'s your company.versus a lot of times when you add. co-founders later. in their mind it\\'s your company. it\\'s not their company and even though. you know you worked on the company an. extra month than the other person did. which is so silly right you\\'ll always. have this like well this wasn\\'t my idea. this wasn\\'t my company.um which isn\\'t great from a retention. perspective if you can both really feel. like you shepherded the idea through the. earliest stages you\\'re going to see a. lot more ownership and people stepping. up when you go through hard times to. reiterate what we talked about at the. beginning. i don\\'t want to say co-founders are. essential. but man they\\'re so helpful it\\'s such a. powerful tool. especially in the hardest part of the. startup the pre-product market fit. startup we still encourage everyone to. have a co-founder. um but like the startup game right it\\'s. not about doing it well it\\'s about doing. it great like having a great co-founder. can be a super power for your company. having an okay co-founder not taking. this seriously.can be the seed of big problems.absolutely and sometimes people they end. up with co-founder issues i\\'m like well. i guess i\\'m just going to quit and start. a new company and we\\'ll well well it\\'s. so easy to start a new company and then. it\\'s like well good luck and then you. speak to them a year or two later and. it\\'s. really hard to get back to where they. were in the moment and one of the. regrets is they wish they would have. spent the time. to set up the co-founder relationship. well and choose the right person first. then think they can just. blow everything up and get a do-over. that\\'s just not how life works and so. the more you can front-load this the. first time around versus having hard. earned lessons. yeah would recommend.\"\\n},\\n{\\n  \"Topic Name\": \"Recommendations Recap\",\\n  \"Description\": \"Recapitulation of the key recommendations from the talk.\",\\n  \"Start Time\": 420,\\n  \"End Time\":
