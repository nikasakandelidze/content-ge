        "text": "As far as we know, Medieval England was never invaded\nby ice zombies, or terrorized by dragons, but it was shaken by a power struggle\nbetween two noble families spanning generations and involving a massive \ncast of characters with complex motives \nand shifting loyalties. If that sounds familiar, it's because the historical conflicts\nknown as the Wars of the Roses served as the basis for much \nof the drama in Game of Thrones. The real-life seeds of war were sewn \nby the death of King Edward III in 1377. Edward's oldest son \nhad died before his father, but his ten-year-old son, Richard II, succeeded to the throne \nahead of Edward's three surviving sons. This skipping of an entire generation left lingering claims to the throne\namong their various offspring, particularly the Lancasters,\ndescended from Edward's third son, and the Yorks, descended \nfrom his fourth son. The name of the ensuing wars comes from the symbols \nassociated with the two families, the white rose of York\nand the red rose of Lancaster. The Lancasters first gained the throne when Richard II was deposed \nby his cousin Henry IV in 1399. Despite sporadic unrest, their reign remained secure until 1422, when Henry V's death \nin a military campaign left an infant Henry VI as king. Weak-willed and dominated by advisors, Henry was eventually convinced to marry\nMargaret of Anjou to gain French support. Margaret was beautiful, ambitious, and ruthless in persecuting \nany threat to her power, and she distrusted \nRichard of York, most of all. York had been the King's close advisor\nand loyal General, but was increasingly \nsidelined by the Queen, who promoted her favorite supporters,\nlike the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset. York's criticism of their inept handling\nof the war against France led to his exclusion from court\nand transfer to Ireland. Meanwhile, mounting military failures, and corrupt rule by Margaret \nand her allies caused widespread discontent, and in the midst of this chaos, Richard of York returned with an army\nto arrest Somerset and reform the court. Initially unsuccessful, \nhe soon got his chance when he was appointed \nProtector of the Realm after Henry suffered a mental breakdown. However, less than a year later, Henry suddendly recovered and the Queen convinced him \nto reverse York's reforms. York fled and raised an army once more. Though he was unable \nto directly seize the throne, he managed to be reinstated as Protector and have himself and his heirs designated\nto succeed Henry. But instead of a crown, York's head acquired a pike after he was killed in battle\nwith the Queen's loyalists. His young son took up the claim\nand was crowned Edward IV. Edward enjoyed great military success\nagainst the Lancasters. Henry was captured, while Margaret fled into exile with their reportedly cruel son, \nEdward of Westminster. But the newly crowned King\nmade a tragic political mistake by backing out of his arranged marriage\nwith a French Princess to secretly marry the widow\nof a minor Noble. This alienated his most powerful ally,\nthe Earl of Warwick. Warwick allied with the Lancasters, turned Edward's jealous \nyounger brother, George, against him, and even briefly managed \nto restore Henry as King, but it didn't last. Edward recaptured the throne, the Lancaster Prince was killed in battle, and Henry himself died \nin captivity not long after. The rest of Edward IV's reign \nwas peaceful, but upon his death in 1483, \nthe bloodshed resumed. Though his twelve-year-old son\nwas due to succeed him, Edward's younger brother Richard III\ndeclared his nephews illegitimate due to their father's secret marriage. He assumed the regency himself\nand threw the boys in prison. Though no one knows what ultimately\nbecame of them, after a while, the Princes disappeared and Richard's power seemed secure. But his downfall would come\nonly two years later from across the narrow sea\nof the English Channel. Henry Tudor was a direct descendant\nof the first Duke of Lancaster, raised in exile after his father's \ndeath in a previous rebellion. With Richard III's power grab\ncausing a split in the York faction, Henry won support for his royal claim. Raising an army in France,\nhe crossed the Channel in 1485 and quickly defeated Richard's forces. And by marrying Elizabeth of York,\nelder sister of the disappeared Princes, the newly crowned Henry VII\njoined the two roses, finally ending nearly a century of war. We often think of historical wars\nas decisive conflicts with clearly defined winners and losers. But the Wars of the Roses,\nlike the fiction they inspired, show us that victories\ncan be uncertain, alliances unstable, and even the power of Kings\nas fleeting as the seasons. "

But if you confess, apologize, \nand implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession— \nor risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing \nthose accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts \nbetween February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia \nabout the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor— and a justice system that valued \nrepentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, \na group of English protestants. Life was strict and isolated \nfor the people of Salem. Battles with their \nNative American neighbors and groups of French settlers\nwere commonplace. People feared starvation and disease, and relations between villagers \nwere strained. To make matters worse, 1692 brought \none of the coldest winters on record. That winter, two cousins, 9 year old Betty Parris and \n11 year old Abigail Williams started behaving very strangely. A physician found nothing \nphysically wrong — but diagnosed the girls \nas under “an evil hand.” Puritans believed that the Devil wreaked \nhavoc in the world through human agents, or witches, who blighted nature, \nconjured fiendish apparitions, and tormented children. As news swept through the village, \nthe symptoms appeared to spread. Accounts describe 12 so-called \n“afflicted” girls contorting their bodies, having fits, \nand complaining of prickling skin. Four of the girls soon accused three\nlocal women of tormenting them. All three of the accused were considered \noutsiders in some way. On February 29th, \nthe authorities arrested Sarah Good, a poor pregnant mother \nof a young daughter, Sarah Osbourne,\nwho had long been absent from church and was suing the family \nof one of her accusers, and Tituba, an enslaved woman \nin Betty Parris’s home known by her first name only. Tituba denied harming the girls at first. But then she confessed to practicing \nwitchcraft on the Devil’s orders, and charged Good and Osbourne \nwith having forced her. Osbourne and Good both \nmaintained their innocence. Osbourne died in prison, while Good’s \nhusband turned against her in court, testifying that she \"was a witch \nor would be one very quickly.\" Good’s 4 year old daughter \nwas imprisoned and eventually gave testimony \nagainst her mother. Meanwhile, Good gave birth in jail. Her baby died, and she was convicted \nand hanged shortly thereafter. Tituba was held in custody until May,\nand then released. These three victims were \njust the beginning. As accusations multiplied, \nothers, like Tituba, made false confession to save themselves. The authorities even reportedly \ntold one accused witch that she would be hanged if she did not \nconfess, and freed if she did. They were not particularly interested\nin thoroughly investigating the charges— in keeping with their Church’s teachings, \nthey preferred that the accused confessed, asked for forgiveness, and promised \nnot to engage in more witchcraft. The court accepted all kinds \nof dubious evidence, including so-called “spectral evidence” in which the girls began raving when \nsupposedly touched by invisible ghosts. Complicating matters further, \nmany of the jurors in the trials were relatives of the accusers,\ncompromising their objectivity. Those who dared to speak out, \nsuch as Judge Nathanial Saltonstall, came under suspicion. By the spring of 1693, \nover a hundred people had been imprisoned, and 14 women \nand 6 men had been executed. By this time, accusations were starting \nto spread beyond Salem to neighboring communities, and even \nthe most powerful figures were targets. When his own wife was accused, the governor of Massachusetts colony \nsuspended the trials. Sentences were amended, \nprisoners released, and arrests stopped. Some have speculated that the girls \nwere suffering from hallucinations caused by fungus; or a condition that caused \nswelling of the brain. But ultimately, the reason \nfor their behavior is unknown. What we do know is that adults \naccepted wild accusations by children as hard evidence. Today, the Salem Witch Trials remain \na cautionary tale of the dangers of groupthink \nand scapegoating, and the power of fear \nto manipulate human perception. "

        "text": "Muscles. We have over 600 of them. They make up between \n1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight, and along with connective tissue, they bind us together, hold us up,\nand help us move. And whether or not body building\nis your hobby, muscles need your constant attention because the way you treat \nthem on a daily basis determines whether \nthey will wither or grow. Say you're standing in front of a door,\nready to pull it open. Your brain and muscles are perfectly\npoised to help you achieve this goal. First, your brain sends a signal\nto motor neurons inside your arm. When they receive this message,\nthey fire, causing muscles to contract and relax, which pull on the bones in your arm\nand generate the needed movement. The bigger the challenge becomes,\nthe bigger the brain's signal grows, and the more motor units it rallies\nto help you achieve your task. But what if the door \nis made of solid iron? At this point, your arm muscles alone won't be able to generate \nenough tension to pull it open, so your brain appeals \nto other muscles for help. You plant your feet, tighten your belly,\nand tense your back, generating enough force to yank it open. Your nervous system has just leveraged\nthe resources you already have, other muscles, to meet the demand. While all this is happening, your muscle fibers undergo \nanother kind of cellular change. As you expose them to stress,\nthey experience microscopic damage, which, in this context, is a good thing. In response, the injured cells release\ninflammatory molecules called cytokines that activate the immune system\nto repair the injury. This is when the muscle-building \nmagic happens. The greater the damage \nto the muscle tissue, the more your body \nwill need to repair itself. The resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles \nbigger and stronger as they adapt to progressively \ngreater demands. Since our bodies have already adapted\nto most everyday activities, those generally don't produce \nenough stress to stimulate new muscle growth. So, to build new muscle,\na process called hypertrophy, our cells need to be exposed to higher\nworkloads than they are used to. In fact, if you don't continuously expose\nyour muscles to some resistance, they will shrink, a process known as muscular atrophy. In contrast, exposing the muscle\nto a high-degree of tension, especially while \nthe muscle is lengthening, also called an eccentric contraction, generates effective conditions\nfor new growth. However, muscles rely on more than\njust activity to grow. Without proper nutrition, \nhormones, and rest, your body would never be able\nto repair damaged muscle fibers. Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building \nblocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids. Adequate protein intake,\nalong with naturally occurring hormones, like insulin-like growth factor\nand testosterone, help shift the body into a state\nwhere tissue is repaired and grown. This vital repair process mainly occurs\nwhen we're resting, especially at night while sleeping. Gender and age \naffect this repair mechanism, which is why young men \nwith more testosterone have a leg up in the muscle building game. Genetic factors also play a role\nin one's ability to grow muscle. Some people have more robust \nimmune reactions to muscle damage, and are better able to repair\nand replace damaged muscle fibers, increasing their \nmuscle-building potential. The body responds to the demands\nyou place on it. If you tear your muscles up,\neat right, rest and repeat, you'll create the conditions to make your\nmuscles as big and strong as possible. It is with muscles as it is with life: Meaningful growth requires challenge\nand stress. "

        "text": "Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing\nuncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the\ngods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny \nprank at the time, but now Thor was about to\nbreak every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some\nway to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless\nhair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary\nsmiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, \ndeep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was\nalready scheming how he would get the\ndwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit\ntwo families against each other. He first visited the masterful\nsons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,\na pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best\ncraftsmen in the world and were determined to prove\nit in a competition. The rules were that each family had to \ncreate three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,\nand told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons\nof Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t \nbe fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate\nif Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, \nLoki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,\nand to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of\nIvaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and\ntold him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly\nflew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the\nforge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,\nthe fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece\nof iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s\neyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,\nBrokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure\nhadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,\noverjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present\ntheir treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures\nfrom the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s\nhead and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could\npierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded\ninto a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures\nmade by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged \na golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across\nthe sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would\nmake eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,\nand Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, \nnever miss its mark and always return\nto Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all \nagreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried \nto flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won\nthe rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,\nbut Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,\nhe pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer\nspread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought\nthem these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer\nfor which he’s still known today. "

Most of this caffeine is consumed\nin coffee and tea, but it's also ingested in some sodas, chocolate, caffeine pills, and even beverages labeled decaf. Caffeine helps us feel alert,\nfocused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,\nand make us feel anxious. It's the world most widely used drug. So how does it keep us awake? Caffeine evolved in plants where\nit serves a few purposes. In high doses, as it's found in the leaves\nand seeds of certain species, it's toxic to insects. But when they consume it in lower doses,\nas it's found in nectar, it can actually help them remember\nand revisit flowers. In the human body, caffeine acts as a\nstimulant for the central nervous system. It keeps us awake by blocking one of\nthe body's key sleep-inducing molecules, a substance called adenosine. Your body needs a constant supply\nof energy, which it gets by breaking down\na high-energy molecule called ATP. In the process, it liberates adenosine,\nATP's chemical backbone. Neurons in your brain have receptors\nperfectly tailored to this molecule. When adenosine docks to these receptors, it activates a cascade \nof biochemical reactions that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important\nbrain-signaling molecules. In other words, you get sleepy. Caffeine is what's called an adenosine\nreceptor antagonist. That means it derails this process\nof slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine and adenosine have a similar\nmolecular structure, close enough that caffeine can wedge into\nthe adenosine receptors, but not close enough to activate them. To summarize, \nadenosine inhibits your neurons. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,\nso it stimulates you. Caffeine can also boost positive feelings. In some neurons, the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors \nfor another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain\nis to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these\npaired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine\nto fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,\nit doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects\non adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too,\nreducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,\nand some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body's\nability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes \nan unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below\na certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine's effects\nare so helpful. It might make you feel better\nand more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate\nand blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages\ncaffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body\nthat have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular\nconsumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors \nare perpetually clogged, your body will manufacture extra ones. That way, even with caffeine around, adenosine can still do its job\nof signaling the brain to power down. That's why you may find you need\nto consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert. There are more and more adenosine\nreceptors to block. It's also why if you suddenly \nquit caffeine, you may experience \nan unpleasant withdrawal. With plenty of receptors \nand no competition, adenosine can work overtime, causing symptoms like headaches, tiredness, and depressed moods. But in a few days, the extra adenosine\nreceptors will disappear, your body will readjust, and you'll feel just as alert as ever, even without an infusion of the world's\nmost popular stimulant. "

        "text": "In the 1600s the Dutch East India Company \nemployed hundreds of ships to trade gold, porcelain, spices, \nand silks around the globe. But running this massive \noperation wasn’t cheap. In order to fund their expensive voyages, the company turned to private citizens– individuals who could invest money \nto support the trip in exchange for a share \nof the ship’s profits. This practice allowed the company \nto afford even grander voyages, increasing profits for both \nthemselves and their savvy investors. Selling these shares in coffee houses \nand shipping ports across the continent, the Dutch East India Company unknowingly\ninvented the world’s first stock market. Since then, companies have been \ncollecting funds from willing investors to support all kinds of businesses. And today, the stock market has schools, careers,\nand even whole television channels dedicated to understanding it. But the modern stock market is \nsignificantly more complicated than its original incarnation. So how do companies and investors\nuse the market today? Let’s imagine a new coffee company \nthat decides to launch on the market. First, the company will advertise itself \nto big investors. If they think the company is a good idea, they get the first crack at investing, and then sponsor the company’s initial \npublic offering, or IPO. This launches the company onto the \nofficial public market, where any company or individual who \nbelieves the business could be profitable might buy a stock. Buying stocks makes those investors \npartial owners in the business. Their investment helps \nthe company to grow, and as it becomes more successful, more buyers may see potential \nand start buying stocks. As demand for those stocks increases, so does their price, increasing \nthe cost for prospective buyers, and raising the value of the company's \nstocks people already own. For the company, this increased interest helps \nfund new initiatives, and also boosts its overall market value by showing how many people \nare willing to invest in their idea. However, if for some reason a company \nstarts to seem less profitable the reverse can also happen. If investors think their stock \nvalue is going to decline, they’ll sell their stocks with the hopes \nof making a profit before the company loses more value. As stocks are sold and demand \nfor the stock goes down, the stock price falls, and with it, the company’s market value. This can leave investors with big losses– unless the company starts to look \nprofitable again. This see-saw of supply and demand \nis influenced by many factors. Companies are under the unavoidable \ninfluence of market forces– such as the fluctuating \nprice of materials, changes in production technology, and the shifting costs of labor. Investors may be worried about \nchanges in leadership, bad publicity, or larger factors like \nnew laws and trade policies. And of course, plenty of investors are simply ready \nto sell valuable stocks and pursue personal interests. All these variables cause day-to-day noise\nin the market, which can make companies appear more\nor less successful. And in the stock market, appearing to lose value often leads \nto losing investors, and in turn, losing actual value. Human confidence in the market has the\npower to trigger everything from economic booms \nto financial crises. And this difficult-to-track \nvariable is why most professionals promote \nreliable long term investing over trying to make quick cash. However, experts are constantly \nbuilding tools in efforts to increase their \nchances of success in this highly unpredictable system. But the stock market is not just \nfor the rich and powerful. With the dawn of the Internet, everyday investors can buy stocks in many of the exact same ways \na large investor would. And as more people educate themselves \nabout this complex system they too can trade stocks, support the businesses they believe in, and pursue their financial goals. The first step is getting invested. "

Most Titans were destroyed or\ndriven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,\nwhose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus\nto fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating \nall living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts\nof the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability \nto move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped\nthe first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods, but Zeus decreed \nthey were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants \nof Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient\ncreatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude\ncreations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide\nhow sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick\nthat would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it\ninto two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed \nthe succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones\nunder a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly\nbest portion for himself, he was outraged \nat Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use\nof fire on Earth, whether to cook meat \nor for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see\nhis creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus\nto steal fire from the workshop \nof Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk\nand brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness\nnature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care \nfor themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons\nand wage war. Prometheus's flames acted as a catalyst\nfor the rapid progression of civilization. When Zeus looked down at this scene,\nhe realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again\nwounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, Zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained\nto a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture\nwho would tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back\nto be attacked again in the morning. Although Prometheus remained \nin perpetual agony, he never expressed regret \nat his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression\nmade him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous\nand inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress,\nand power he brought to human hands. He's also a recurring figure\nin art and literature. In Percy Bysshe Shelley's\nlyrical drama \"Prometheus Unbound,\" the author imagines Prometheus\nas a romantic hero who escapes and continues to spread\nempathy and knowledge. Of his protagonist, Shelley wrote, \"Prometheus is the type \nof the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest \nand the truest motives to the best and noblest ends.\" His wife Mary envisaged Prometheus\nas a more cautionary figure and subtitled her novel\n\"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus.\" This suggests the damage of corrupting\nthe natural order and remains relevant \nto the ethical questions surrounding science and technology today. As hero, rebel, or trickster, Prometheus remains a symbol of our\ncapacity to capture the powers of nature, and ultimately, he reminds us of the potential \nof individual acts to ignite the world. "

        "text": "In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie \ndiscovered radium. Claimed to have restorative properties, radium was added to toothpaste, medicine, water, and food. A glowing, luminous green, it was also used in beauty products\nand jewelry. It wasn't until the mid-20th century we realized that radium's harmful\neffects as a radioactive element outweighed its visual benefits. Unfortunately, radium isn't the only\npigment that historically seemed harmless or useful but turned out to be deadly. That lamentable distinction includes\na trio of colors and pigments that we've long used to decorate ourselves\nand the things we make: white, green, and orange. Our story begins with white. As far back as the 4th century BCE, the Ancient Greeks treated lead to make\nthe brilliant white pigment we know today. The problem? In humans, lead is directly absorbed\ninto the body and distributed to the blood, soft tissues, and mineralized tissues. Once in the nervous system, lead mimics and disrupts the normal\nfunctions of calcium, causing damages ranging \nfrom learning disabilities to high blood pressure. Yet the practice \nof using this toxic pigment continued across time and cultures. Lead white was the only practical choice\nfor white oil or tempera paint until the 19th century. To make their paint, artists would grind\na block of lead into powder, exposing highly toxic dust particles. The pigment's liberal use resulted\nin what was known as painter's colic, or what we'd now call lead poisoning. Artists who worked with lead complained\nof palseys, melancholy, coughing, enlarged retinas, and even blindness. But lead white's density, opacity,\nand warm tone were irresistible to artists like Vermeer,\nand later, the Impressionists. Its glow couldn't be matched, and the pigment continued to be widely\nused until it was banned in the 1970s. As bad as all that sounds, white's dangerous effects \npale in comparison to another, \nmore wide-spread pigment, green. Two synthetic greens called \nScheele's Green and Paris Green were first introduced in the 18th century. They were far more vibrant and flashy than the relatively dull greens\nmade from natural pigments, so they quickly became popular choices\nfor paint as well as dye for textiles, wallpaper, soaps, cake decorations, toys, candy, and clothing. These green pigments were made from\na compound called cupric hydrogen arsenic. In humans, exposure to arsenic can damage the way cells \ncommunicate and function. And high levels of arsenic have been\ndirectly linked to cancer and heart disease. As a result, 18th century fabric\nfactory workers were often poisoned, and women in green dresses \nreportedly collapsed from exposure to arsenic on their skin. Bed bugs were rumored not to live\nin green rooms, and it's even been speculated that\nNapoleon died from slow arsenic poisoning from sleeping in his green \nwallpapered bedroom. The intense toxicity of these green\nstayed under wraps until the arsenic recipe was published\nin 1822. And a century later, it was repurposed\nas an insecticide. Synthetic green was probably the most\ndangerous color in widespread use, but at least it didn't share radium's\nproperty of radioactivity. Another color did, though - orange. Before World War II, it was common\nfor manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in colored glazes. The compound produced brilliant\nreds and oranges, which were appealing attributes,\nif not for the radiation they emitted. Of course, radiation was something\nwe were unaware of until the late 1800s, let alone the associated cancer risks,\nwhich we discovered much later. During World War II, the U.S. government confiscated all uranium\nfor use in bomb development. However, the atomic energy commission\nrelaxed these restrictions in 1959, and depleted uranium returned to ceramics\nand glass factory floors. Orange dishes made during \nthe next decade may still have some hazardous qualities\non their surfaces to this day. Most notably, vintage fiestaware\nreads positive for radioactivity. And while the levels are low enough that\nthey don't officially pose a health risk if they're on a shelf, the U.S. EPA warns against eating food\noff of them. Though we still occasionally run \ninto issues with synthetic food dyes, our scientific understanding has helped us\nprune hazardous colors out of our lives. "

        "text": "Translator: tom carter\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Most people have heard of the Electoral College during presidential election years. But what exactly is the Electoral College? Simply said, it is a group of people appointed by each state who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States. To understand how this process began and how it continues today, we can look at the Constitution of the United States: article two, section one, clause two of the constitution. It specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have. Since 1964, there have been 538 electors in each presidential election. How do they decide on the number 538? Well, the number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress. 435 representatives, plus 100 senators, and 3 electors from the District of Columbia. Essentially, the Democratic candidate and Republican candidate are each trying to add up the electors in every state so that they surpass 270 electoral votes, or just over half the 538 votes, and win the presidency. So how do states even get electoral votes? Each state receives a particular number of electors based on population size. The census is conducted every 10 years, so every time the census happens, states might gain or lose a few electoral votes. Let's say you're a voter in California, a state with 55 electoral votes. If your candidate wins in California, they get all 55 of the state's electoral votes. If your candidate loses, they get none. This is why many presidential candidates want to win states like Texas, Florida, and New York. If you currently add up the electoral votes of those three states, you would have 96 electoral votes. Even if a candidate won North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire. Connecticut and West Virginia, they would only gain 31 electoral votes total from those eight states. Here is where it can get a little tricky. On a rare occasion, like in the year 2000, someone can win the popular vote but fail to gain 270 electoral votes. This means that the winner may have won and collected their electoral votes by small margins, winning just enough states with just enough electoral votes, but the losing candidate may have captured large voter margins in the remaining states. If this is the case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states would add up to over 50% of the ballots cast nationally. Therefore, the losing candidate may have gained more than 50% of the ballots cast by voters, but failed to gain 270 of the electoral votes. Some critics of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to states with large numbers of electoral votes. Think of it this way. It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote -- not one vote -- in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia. This is why both parties pay attention to these states. However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire, and even geographically large states with small populations like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas. That's because a candidate can't completely ignore small states, because in a close election, every electoral vote counts. There are certain states that have a long history of voting for a particular party. These are known as \"safe states.\" For the past four election cycles -- in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 -- Democrats could count on states like Oregon, Maryland, Michigan and Massachusetts, whereas the Republicans could count on states like Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas and Idaho. States that are teetering between between parties are called \"swing states.\" In the past four election cycles, Ohio and Florida have been swing states, twice providing electoral votes for a Democratic candidate, and twice providing electoral votes for a Republican candidate. Think about it. Do you live in a safe state? If so, is it a Democratic or Republican safe state? Do you live in a swing state? Are your neighboring states swing or safe? Is the population in your state increasing or decreasing? And do not forget, when you are watching the electoral returns on election night every four years and the big map of the United States is on the screen, know that the magic number is 270 and start adding.

        "text": "\"Someone must have been telling\nlies about Josef K. He knew he had done nothing wrong,\nbut one morning, he was arrested.\" Thus begins \"The Trial,\" one of author Franz Kafka's\nmost well-known novels. K, the protagonist, \nis arrested out of nowhere and made to go through\na bewildering process where neither the cause of his arrest, nor the nature \nof the judicial proceedings are made clear to him. This sort of scenario is considered\nso characteristic of Kafka's work that scholars came up \nwith a new word for it. Kafkaesque has entered the vernacular\nto describe unnecessarily complicated and frustrating experiences, like being forced to navigate labyrinths\nof bureaucracy. But does standing in a long line\nto fill out confusing paperwork really capture the richness \nof Kafka's vision? Beyond the word's casual use,\nwhat makes something Kafkaesque? Franz Kafka's stories do indeed deal\nwith many mundane and absurd aspects of modern bureaucracy, drawn in part from his experience\nof working as an insurance clerk in early 20th century Prague. Many of his protagonists \nare office workers compelled to struggle through\na web of obstacles in order to achieve their goals, and often the whole ordeal turns out\nto be so disorienting and illogical that success becomes pointless\nin the first place. For example, in the short story, \n\"Poseidon,\" the Ancient Greek god is an executive\nso swamped with paperwork that he's never had time to explore\nhis underwater domain. The joke here is that not even\na god can handle the amount of paperwork demanded by the modern workplace. But the reason why is telling. He's unwilling to delegate any of the work because he deems everyone else \nunworthy of the task. Kafka's Poseidon is a prisoner\nof his own ego. This simple story contains \nall of the elements that make for a truly Kafkaesque scenario. It's not the absurdity \nof bureaucracy alone, but the irony of the character's \ncircular reasoning in reaction to it that is emblematic of Kafka's writing. His tragicomic stories act as a form of\nmythology for the modern industrial age, employing dream logic to explore\nthe relationships between systems of arbitrary power\nand the individuals caught up in them. Take, for example, Kafka's \nmost famous story, \"Metamorphosis.\" When Gregor Samsa awaken's one morning\nto find himself transformed into a giant insect, his greatest worry \nis that he gets to work on time. Of course, this proves impossible. It was not only the authoritarian realm\nof the workplace that inspired Kafka. Some of his protagonists' struggles\ncome from within. The short story, \"A Hunger Artist,\" describes a circus performer whose act\nconsists of extended fasts. He's upset that the circus master\nlimits these to 40 days, believing this prevents him from achieving\ngreatness in his art. But when his act loses popularity, he is left free \nto starve himself to death. The twist comes when he lays dying\nin anonymity, regretfully admitting that his art\nhas always been a fraud. He fasted not through strength of will, but simply because he never found\na food he liked. Even in \"The Trial,\" which seems to focus \ndirectly on bureaucracy, the vague laws and bewildering procedures\npoint to something far more sinister: the terrible momentum of the legal system\nproves unstoppable, even by supposedly powerful officials. This is a system \nthat doesn't serve justice, but whose sole function \nis to perpetuate itself. What political theorist Hannah Arendt, writing years after Kafka's death, would call \"tyranny without a tyrant.\" Yet accompanying \nthe bleakness of Kafka's stories, there's a great deal of humor rooted in the nonsensical logic\nof the situations described. So on the one hand, it's easy to recognize\nthe Kafkaesque in today's world. We rely on increasingly convoluted systems\nof administration that have real consequences on\nevery aspect of our lives. And we find our every word judged\nby people we can't see according to rules we don't know. On the other hand, by fine-tuning\nour attention to the absurd, Kafka also reflects our shortcomings\nback at ourselves. In doing so, he reminds us that the world\nwe live in is one we create, and have the power \nto change for the better. "

This was the reality for millions\nof people during the 45-year period after World War II, now known as the Cold War. As the United States and Soviet Union\nfaced off across the globe, each knew that the other had nuclear\nweapons capable of destroying it. And destruction never loomed closer\nthan during the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1961, the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to\noverthrow Cuba's new communist government. That failed attempt was known\nas the Bay of Pigs, and it convinced Cuba to seek help\nfrom the U.S.S.R. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev\nwas happy to comply by secretly deploying nuclear\nmissiles to Cuba, not only to protect the island, but to counteract the threat from\nU.S. missiles in Italy and Turkey. By the time U.S. intelligence \ndiscovered the plan, the materials to create the missiles\nwere already in place. At an emergency meeting on\nOctober 16, 1962, military advisors urged an airstrike\non missile sites and invasion of the island. But President John F. Kennedy chose\na more careful approach. On October 22, he announced that the\nthe U.S. Navy would intercept all shipments to Cuba. There was just one problem: a naval blockade was considered\nan act of war. Although the President called it\na quarantine that did not block basic necessities, the Soviets didn't appreciate \nthe distinction. In an outraged letter to Kennedy, Khrushchev wrote, \"The violation \nof freedom to use international waters and international airspace\nis an act of aggression which pushes mankind toward the abyss\nof world nuclear missile war.\" Thus ensued the most intense\nsix days of the Cold War. While the U.S. demanded the removal\nof the missiles, Cuba and the U.S.S.R insisted\nthey were only defensive. And as the weapons continued\nto be armed, the U.S. prepared for a possible invasion. On October 27, a spy plane piloted\nby Major Rudolph Anderson was shot down by a Soviet missile. The same day, a nuclear-armed Soviet\nsubmarine was hit by a small-depth charge from a U.S. Navy vessel trying\nto signal it to come up. The commanders on the sub,\ntoo deep to communicate with the surface, thought war had begun\nand prepared to launch a nuclear torpedo. That decision had to be made unanimously\nby three officers. The captain and political officer\nboth authorized the launch, but Vasili Arkhipov, \nsecond in command, refused. His decision saved the day\nand perhaps the world. But the crisis wasn't over. For the first time in history, the U.S. Military set itself\nto DEFCON 2, the defense readiness one step\naway from nuclear war. With hundreds of nuclear missiles\nready to launch, the metaphorical Doomsday Clock\nstood at one minute to midnight. But diplomacy carried on. In Washington, D.C., Attorney General\nRobert Kennedy secretly met with Soviet Ambassador\nAnatoly Dobrynin. After intense negotiation,\nthey reached the following proposal. The U.S. would remove their missiles\nfrom Turkey and Italy and promise to never invade Cuba in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal\nfrom Cuba under U.N. inspection. Once the meeting had concluded, Dobrynin cabled Moscow saying \ntime is of the essence and we shouldn't miss the chance. And at 9 a.m. the next day, a message arrived from Khrushchev announcing the Soviet missiles would be\nremoved from Cuba. The crisis was now over. While criticized at the time by their\nrespective governments for bargaining with the enemy, contemporary historical analysis\nshows great admiration for Kennedy's and Khrushchev's ability\nto diplomatically solve the crisis. But the disturbing lesson was that\na slight communication error, or split-second decision by a commander,\ncould have thwarted all their efforts, as it nearly did if not for \nVasili Arkhipov's courageous choice. The Cuban Missile Crisis revealed just how\nfragile human politics are compared to the terrifying power\nthey can unleash. "

        "text": "Right now, you're probably sitting down\nto watch this video and staying seated for a few minutes\nto view it is probably okay. But the longer you stay put,\nthe more agitated your body becomes. It sits there counting down the moments\nuntil you stand up again and take it for a walk. That may sound ridiculous. Our bodies love to sit, right? Not really. Sure, sitting for brief periods \ncan help us recover from stress or recuperate from exercise. But nowadays, our lifestyles make us sit\nmuch more than we move around, and our bodies simply aren't built\nfor such a sedentary existence. In fact, just the opposite is true. The human body is built to move, and you can see evidence of that\nin the way it's structured. Inside us are over 360 joints,\nand about 700 skeletal muscles that enable easy, fluid motion. The body's unique physical structure\ngives us the ability to stand up straight against the pull of gravity. Our blood depends on us moving around\nto be able to circulate properly. Our nerve cells benefit from movement, and our skin is elastic, \nmeaning it molds to our motions. So if every inch of the body\nis ready and waiting for you to move, what happens when you just don't? Let's start with the backbone\nof the problem, literally. Your spine is a long structure made of bones and the cartilage discs\nthat sit between them. Joints, muscles and ligaments\nthat are attached to the bones hold it all together. A common way of sitting is with a\ncurved back and slumped shoulders, a position that puts uneven\npressure on your spine. Over time, this causes wear and tear\nin your spinal discs, overworks certain ligaments and joints, and puts strain on muscles that stretch to accommodate \nyour back's curved position. This hunched shape also shrinks\nyour chest cavity while you sit, meaning your lungs have less space\nto expand into when you breath. That's a problem because it temporarily\nlimits the amount of oxygen that fills your lungs\nand filters into your blood. Around the skeleton are the muscles,\nnerves, arteries and veins that form the body's soft tissue layers. The very act of sitting squashes,\npressurizes and compresses, and these more delicate tissues\nreally feel the brunt. Have you ever experienced numbness\nand swelling in your limbs when you sit? In areas that are the most compressed, your nerves, arteries and veins\ncan become blocked, which limits nerve signaling,\ncausing the numbness, and reduces blood flow in your limbs,\ncausing them to swell. Sitting for long periods also temporarily\ndeactivates lipoprotein lipase, a special enzyme in the walls\nof blood capillaries that breaks down fats in the blood, so when you sit, you're not burning fat\nnearly as well as when you move around. What effect does all of this stasis\nhave on the brain? Most of the time, \nyou probably sit down to use your brain, but ironically, lengthy periods of sitting\nactually run counter to this goal. Being stationary reduces blood flow and the amount of oxygen entering\nyour blood stream through your lungs. Your brain requires both \nof those things to remain alert, so your concentration levels\nwill most likely dip as your brain activity slows. Unfortunately, the ill effects of being\nseated don't only exist in the short term. Recent studies have found \nthat sitting for long periods is linked with some types of cancers\nand heart disease and can contribute to diabetes,\nkidney and liver problems. In fact, researchers \nhave worked out that, worldwide, inactivity causes about \n9% of premature deaths a year. That's over 5 million people. So what seems like such a harmless habit actually has the power \nto change our health. But luckily, the solutions to this\nmounting threat are simple and intuitive. When you have no choice but to sit, try switching the slouch \nfor a straighter spine, and when you don't have \nto be bound to your seat, aim to move around much more, perhaps by setting a reminder\nto yourself to get up every half hour. But mostly, just appreciate that bodies\nare built for motion, not for stillness. In fact, since the video's almost over,\nwhy not stand up and stretch right now? Treat your body to a walk. It'll thank you later. "

More precise time-keeping, like sundials and mechanical clocks, eventually came along to put time in more convenient boxes. But what exactly is it that we’re measuring? Is time something that physically exists, or is it just in our heads? At first the answer seems obvious— of course time exists; it constantly unfolds all around us, and it’s hard to imagine the universe without it. But our understanding of time started getting complicated thanks to Einstein. His theory of relativity tells us that time passes for everyone, but doesn’t always pass at the same rate for people in different situations, like those travelling close to the speed of light or orbiting a supermassive black hole. Einstein resolved the malleability of time by combining it with space to define space-time, which can bend, but behaves\nin consistent, predictable ways. Einstein’s theory seemed to confirm that time is woven into the very fabric of the universe. But there’s a big question it didn’t fully resolve: why is it we can move through space in any direction, but through time in only one? No matter what we do, the past is always, stubbornly, behind us. This is called the arrow of time. When a drop of food coloring is dropped into a glass of water, we instinctively know that the coloring will drift out from the drop, eventually filling the glass. Imagine watching the opposite happen. Here, we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards. We live in a universe where the food coloring spreads out in the water,  not a universe where it collects together. In physics, this is described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that systems will gain disorder, or entropy, over time. Systems in our universe move from order to disorder, and it is that property of the universe that defines the direction of time’s arrow. So if time is such a fundamental property, it should be in our most fundamental equations describing the universe, right? We currently have two sets of equations that govern physics. General relativity describes the behavior of very large things, while quantum physics explains the very small. One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics over the last half century has been reconciling the two into one fundamental “theory of everything.\" There have been many attempts —none yet proven— and they treat time in different ways. Oddly enough, one contender called the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, doesn’t include time at all. Like all current theories of everything, that equation is speculative. But as a thought experiment, if it or a similarly time-starved equation turned out to be true, would that mean that time doesn’t exist, at the most fundamental level? Could time just be some sort of illusion generated by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe? We don’t yet know, but maybe that’s the wrong way of thinking about it. Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property, maybe it could exist as an emergent one. Emergent properties are things that don’t exist in individual pieces of a system, but do exist for the system as a whole. Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide, but the whole ocean does. A movie creates change through time by using a series of still images that appear to have a fluid, continuous change between them. Flipping through the images fast enough, our brains perceive the passage of time from the sequence of still images. No individual frame of the movie changes or contains the passage of time, but it’s a property that comes out of how the pieces are strung together. The movement is real, yet also an illusion. Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion? Physicists are still exploring these and other questions, so we’re far from a complete explanation. At least for the moment. "

But as you study the inscriptions\nin the near total darkness, two of the eight graduate students\naccompanying you bump into the alter. Suddenly, two whisps of green smoke\nburst forth and the walls begin to shake. Fleeing for your lives, you come to a room you passed before\nwith five hallways, including the one to the altar\nand the one leading back outside. The giant sandglass in the center\nis now flowing, with less than an hour before it empties, and the rumbling tells you that you don't \nwant to be around when that happens. From what you recall of your way here, it would take about 20 minutes to reach\nthe exit at a fast pace. You know this is the last junction\nbefore the exit, but your trail markings have been erased, and no one remembers the way. If nine of you split up, there should be just enough time for each group to explore one of the four\nhalls ahead and report back to this room, with everyone then making \na run down the correct path. There's just one problem; the inscriptions told \nof the altar's curse: the spirits of the city's King and Queen\npossessing intruders and leading them to their doom\nthrough deception. Remembering the green smoke, you realize two of the students\nhave been cursed. At any time, \none or both of them might lie, though they also might tell the truth. You know for sure that the curse\ndidn't get you, but you don't know which students\ncan't be trusted, and because the possessed students\nmay lie only occasionally, there is no guaranteed way to test\nthem to determine which are cursed. Can you figure out a way to ensure\nthat you all escape? Don't worry about the possessed\nstudents attacking or otherwise harming the others. This curse only affects\ntheir communication. Pause the video now if you\nwant to figure it out by yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The first thing to realize is that since\nyou know you aren't possessed, you can explore one of the halls alone. This leaves eight students \nfor the remaining three paths. Sending groups of four down just two\nof the paths won't work because if one group came back split\ntwo versus two, you'd have to guess who to trust. But splitting them into one pair\nand two trios would work every time, and here's why. The possessed students might lie,\nor they might not, but you know there are only two of them, while the other six will \nalways tell the truth. When each group returns to the hall, all of its members will either give\nthe same report or argue about \nwhether they found the exit. If a trio returns in total agreement, then you know none of them are lying. With the pair, \nyou can't be sure either way, but all you need is reliable evidence\nabout three of the four paths. The fourth you can figure out\nusing the process of elimination. Of course, none of this matters if you're\nlucky enough to find the exit yourself, but otherwise, putting everything together\nleaves you with three possibilities. If each group gives a consistent answer, either everyone is telling the truth, or the two possessed students \nare paired together. In either case, ignore the duo. If there's only one group arguing,\nboth others must be telling the truth, and if there are two conflicts, then the possessed students\nare in separate groups and you can safely trust the majority\nin both trios since at least two people in each\nwill be truthful. The temple collapses behind you as greenish vapors \nescape from two of the students. You're all safe and free from the curse. After that ordeal, you tell your group \nthey all deserve a vacation, and you just happen to have\nanother expedition coming up. "

On the second day, \nhis eyes stopped focusing. Next, he lost the ability\nto identify objects by touch. By day three, Gardner was moody\nand uncoordinated. At the end of the experiment,\nhe was struggling to concentrate, had trouble with short-term memory, became paranoid, and started hallucinating. Although Gardner recovered without\nlong-term psychological or physical damage, for others, losing shuteye can result\nin hormonal imbalance, illness, and, in extreme cases, death. We're only beginning to understand\nwhy we sleep to begin with, but we do know it's essential. Adults need seven to eight hours\nof sleep a night, and adolescents need about ten. We grow sleepy due to signals\nfrom our body telling our brain we are tired, and signals from the environment\ntelling us it's dark outside. The rise in sleep-inducing chemicals, like adenosine and melatonin, send us into a light doze \nthat grows deeper, making our breathing \nand heart rate slow down and our muscles relax. This non-REM sleep is when DNA is repaired and our bodies replenish themselves\nfor the day ahead. In the United States, it's estimated that 30% of adults\nand 66% of adolescents are regularly sleep-deprived. This isn't just a minor inconvenience. Staying awake can cause \nserious bodily harm. When we lose sleep, learning, memory, mood, and reaction time are affected. Sleeplessness may also cause inflammation, halluciations, high blood pressure, and it's even been linked\nto diabetes and obesity. In 2014, a devoted soccer fan died after staying awake for 48 hours \nto watch the World Cup. While his untimely death \nwas due to a stroke, studies show that chronically sleeping\nfewer than six hours a night increases stroke risk \nby four and half times compared to those getting a consistent\nseven to eight hours of shuteye. For a handful of people on the planet who\ncarry a rare inherited genetic mutation, sleeplessness is a daily reality. This condition, \nknown as Fatal Familial Insomnia, places the body in a nightmarish \nstate of wakefulness, forbidding it from entering \nthe sanctuary of sleep. Within months or years, this progressively worsening condition\nleads to dementia and death. How can sleep deprivation\ncause such immense suffering? Scientists think the answer lies\nwith the accumulation of waste prducts in the brain. During our waking hours, our cells are busy using up\nour day's energy sources, which get broken down \ninto various byproducts, including adenosine. As adenosine builds up, it increases the urge to sleep,\nalso known as sleep pressure. In fact, caffeine works by blocking\nadenosine's receptor pathways. Other waste products \nalso build up in the brain, and if they're not cleared away,\nthey collectively overload the brain and are thought to lead to the many\nnegative symptoms of sleep deprivation. So, what's happening in our brain\nwhen we sleep to prevent this? Scientists found something called\nthe glymphatic system, a clean-up mechanism \nthat removes this buildup and is much more active when we're asleep. It works by using cerebrospinal fluid\nto flush away toxic byproducts that accumulate between cells. Lymphatic vessels, \nwhich serve as pathways for immune cells, have recently been discovered \nin the brain, and they may also play a role in clearing\nout the brain's daily waste products. While scientists continue exploring\nthe restorative mechanisms behind sleep, we can be sure that slipping \ninto slumber is a necessity if we want to maintain our health\nand our sanity. "

        "text": "In the early hours of August 13, 1961, East German construction workers flanked\nby soldiers and police began tearing up streets and erecting\nbarriers throughout the city of Berlin and its surroundings. This night marked the beginning of one\nof history's most infamous dividing lines, the Berlin Wall. Construction on the wall continued\nfor the next decade as it cut through neighborhoods, separated families, and divided not just Germany,\nbut the world. To understand how we got to this point, we have to go back to World War II. America, Britain, and France joined forces with the Soviet Union\nagainst the Axis Powers. After they defeated Nazi Germany, each of the victorious nations occupied\npart of the country. The division was meant to be temporary, but the former allies found \nthemselves at odds over their visions for post-war Europe. While Western powers promoted\nliberal market economies, the Soviet Union sought to surround itself\nwith obedient Communist nations, including a weakened Germany. As their relations deteriorated, the Federal Republic of Germany\nwas formed in the West while the Soviets established the\nGerman Democratic Republic in the East. The Soviet satellite countries restricted\nWestern trade and movement, so a virtually impassable border formed. It became known as the Iron Curtain. In the former German capital of Berlin,\nthings were particularly complicated. Although the city lay fully within\nthe East German territory of the GDR, the post-war agreement gave the allies\njoint administration. So America, Britain, and France created\na Democratic enclave in Berlin's western districts. While East Germans were officially banned\nfrom leaving the country, in Berlin, it was simply \na matter of walking, or riding a subway, streetcar or bus, to the Western half, then traveling on to West Germany\nor beyond. This open border posed a problem\nfor the East German leadership. They had staked a claim to represent\nthe Communist resistance against Hitler and portrayed Western Germany as\na continuation of the Nazi regime. While the U.S. and its allies poured\nmoney into West Germany's reconstruction, the Soviet Union extracted resources\nfrom the East as war reparations, making its planned economy \neven less competitive. Life in East Germany passed under\nthe watchful eye of the Stasi, the secret police whose wiretaps \nand informants monitored citizens for any hint of disloyalty. While there was free health care\nand education in the East, the West boasted higher salaries, more consumer goods, and greater personal freedom. By 1961, about 3.5 million people,\nnearly 20% of the East German population, had left, \nincluding many young professionals. To prevent further losses, East Germany decided to close the border,\nand that's where the Berlin Wall came in. Extending for 43 kilometers\nthrough Berlin, and a further 112 through East Germany, the initial barrier consisted\nof barbed wire and mesh fencing. Some Berliners escaped by\njumping over the wire or leaving from windows, but as the wall expanded,\nthis became more difficult. By 1965, 106 kilometers of 3.6-meter-high\nconcrete barricades had been added topped with a smooth \npipe to prevent climbing. Over the coming years, the barrier\nwas strengthened with spike strips, guard dogs, and even landmines, along with 302 watchtowers\nand 20 bunkers. A parallel fence in the rear set off\na 100-meter area called the death strip. There, all buildings were demolished\nand the ground covered with sand to provide a clear line of sight\nfor the hundreds of guards ordered to shoot anyone \nattempting to cross. Nevertheless, nearly 5,000 people\nin total managed to flee East Germany between 1961 and 1989. Some were diplomats or athletes\nwho defected while abroad, but others were ordinary citizens who\ndug tunnels, swam across canals, flew hot air balloons, or even crashed a stolen tank\nthrough the wall. Yet the risk was great. Over 138 people died\nwhile attempting escape. Some shot in full view of West Germans\npowerless to help them. The wall stabilized East Germany's economy\nby preventing its work force from leaving, but tarnished its reputation, becoming a global symbol \nof Communist repression. As part of reconciliation with the East, the Basic Treaty of 1972 recognized\nEast Germany pragmatically while West Germany retained its hope\nfor eventual reunification. Although the Eastern regime\ngradually allowed family visits, it tried to discourage people\nfrom exercising these rights with an arduous bureaucratic process\nand high fees. Nonetheless, it was still overwhelmed\nby applications. By the end of the 1980's, the liberalization of \nother Eastern Bloc regimes caused mass demonstrations\nfor free travel and demands for democracy. On the evening of November 9, 1989, East Germany tried to defuse tension\nby making travel permits easier to obtain. But the announcement brought thousands\nof East Berliners to the border crossing points in the wall, forcing the surprised guards to open\nthe gates immediately. Rejoicing crowds poured into West Berlin as people from both sides danced \natop the wall. And others began to demolish it \nwith whatever tools they could find. Although the border guards initially\ntried to maintain order, it was soon clear that the years\nof division were at an end. After four decades, Germany was\nofficially reunified in October 1990. And the Soviet Union fell soon after. Today, parts of the wall still \nstand as a reminder that any barriers we put up \nto impede freedom, we can also break down. "

They're cute, they're lovable, and judging by the 26 billions views\nof over 2 million YouTube videos of them pouncing, bouncing, climbing, cramming, stalking, clawing, chattering, and purring, one thing is certain: cats are very entertaining. These somewhat strange feline behaviors, both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking,\n\"Why do cats do that?\" Throughout time, cats were simultaneously\nsolitary predators of smaller animals and prey for larger carnivores. As both predator and prey, survival of their species depended\non crucial instinctual behaviors which we still observe in wild \nand domestic cats today. While the feline actions of your house cat\nGrizmo might seem perplexing, in the wild, these same behaviors, naturally bred into cats \nfor millions of years, would make Grizmo a super cat. Enabled by their unique muscular structure\nand keen balancing abilities, cats climbed to high vantage points\nto survey their territory and spot prey in the wild. Grizmo doesn't need these particular\nskills to find and hunt down dinner in her food bowl today, but instinctually, viewing the living room\nfrom the top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do. As wild predators, cats are opportunistic\nand hunt whenever prey is available. Since most cat prey are small, cats in the wild needed to eat \nmany times each day, and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat\nstrategy to stay fed. This is why Grizmo prefers to chase\nand pounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course\nof the day and night. Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny\nspaces in their natural environments, so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity\nto reach into containers and openings is that she is compelled by \nthe same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of\nher species for millions of years before. In the wild, cats needed sharp claws\nfor climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces\nkept them conditioned and ready, helped stretch their back and leg muscles, and relieve some stress, too. So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch, chair, ottoman, pillows, curtains, and everything else \nyou put in her environment. She's ripping these things to shreds\nand keeping her claws in tip-top shape because this is exactly what her ancestors\ndid in order to survive. As animals that were preyed upon, cats evolved to not get caught, and in the wild, the cats that were \nthe best at avoiding predators thrived. So at your house today, Grizmo is an expert \nat squeezing into small spaces and seeking out and hiding\nin unconventional spots. It also explains why she prefers\na clean and odor-free litter box. That's less likely to give away \nher location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby. Considering everything \nwe do know about cats, it seems that one of their most \npredominate behaviors is still one of the most mysterious. Cats may purr for any number of reasons, such as happiness, stress, and hunger. But curiously, \nthe frequency of their purrs, between 25 and 150 hertz, is within a range that can promote\ntissue regeneration. So while her purring makes Grizmo\nan excellent nap companion, it is also possible that her purr\nis healing her muscles and bones, and maybe even yours, too. They developed through time as both solitary predators \nthat hunted and killed to eat, and stealthy prey that hid\nand escaped to survive. So cats today retain many \nof the same instincts that allowed them to thrive in the wild\nfor millions of years. This explains some of their seemingly\nstrange behaviors. To them, our homes are their jungles. But if this is the case, \nin our own cat's eyes, who are we? Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with\nthem for resources? Terribly stupid predators they're able\nto outsmart every day? Or maybe they think we're the prey. "

        "text": "Whether it’s being chained to a burning \nwheel, turned into a spider, or having an eagle eat one’s liver, Greek mythology is filled \nwith stories of the gods inflicting gruesome horrors \non mortals who angered them. Yet one of their most famous \npunishments is not remembered for its outrageous cruelty, \nbut for its disturbing familiarity. Sisyphus was the first king of Ephyra, \nnow known as Corinth. Although a clever ruler who made his city \nprosperous, he was also a devious tyrant who seduced his niece and \nkilled visitors to show off his power. This violation of the sacred hospitality \ntradition greatly angered the gods. But Sisyphus may still have \navoided punishment if it hadn’t been for his \nreckless confidence. The trouble began when Zeus \nkidnapped the nymph Aegina, carrying her away in the form \nof a massive eagle. Aegina’s father, the river god Asopus, \npursued their trail to Ephyra, where he encountered Sisyphus. In exchange for the god making\na spring inside the city, the king told Asopus which way \nZeus had taken the girl. When Zeus found out, he was so furious\nthat he ordered Thanatos, or Death, to chain Sisyphus in the underworld \nso he couldn’t cause any more problems. But Sisyphus lived up to \nhis crafty reputation. As he was about to be imprisoned, the king asked Thanatos to show him \nhow the chains worked – and quickly bound him instead, \nbefore escaping back among the living. With Thanatos trapped, no one could die, \nand the world was thrown into chaos. Things only returned to normal \nwhen the god of war Ares, upset that battles were no longer fun, \nfreed Thanatos from his chains. Sisyphus knew his reckoning was at hand. But he had another trick up his sleeve. Before dying, he asked his wife Merope\nto throw his body in the public square, from where it eventually washed up on \nthe shores of the river Styx. Now back among the dead, \nSisyphus approached Persephone, queen of the Underworld, and complained that his wife had disrespected him \nby not giving him a proper burial. Persephone granted him permission to go\nback to the land of living and punish Merope, on the condition that \nhe would return when he was done. Of course, Sisyphus refused \nto keep his promise, now having twice escaped death\nby tricking the gods. There wouldn’t be a third time, as the messenger Hermes dragged\nSisyphus back to Hades. The king had thought he was \nmore clever than the gods, but Zeus would have the last laugh. Sisyphus’s punishment was \na straightforward task – rolling a massive boulder up a hill. But just as he approached the top, the \nrock would roll all the way back down, forcing him to start over …and over, and over, for all eternity. Historians have suggested that the tale \nof Sisyphus may stem from ancient myths about the rising and setting sun, \nor other natural cycles. But the vivid image of someone condemned \nto endlessly repeat a futile task has resonated as an allegory \nabout the human condition. In his classic essay\nThe Myth of Sisyphus, existentialist philosopher Albert Camus \ncompared the punishment to humanity’s futile search \nfor meaning and truth in a meaningless and \nindifferent universe. Instead of despairing, Camus imagined \nSisyphus defiantly meeting his fate as he walks down the hill to begin \nrolling the rock again. And even if the daily \nstruggles of our lives sometimes seem equally \nrepetitive and absurd, we still give them significance and value \nby embracing them as our own. "

        "text": "A lone priestess walks towards\nan underground chamber. People line the streets to watch\nas she proclaims her innocence. It doesn't matter. She's already been judged\nand found guilty. The sentence? Live burial. The underground chamber contains\na portion of bread, water, milk, and oil. She will have a lamp, a bed,\nand a blanket, but she won't emerge alive. At the threshold, the priestess pauses, claims her innocence one last time, then enters the chamber never\nto be seen again by the Roman people. The priestess is one \nof Rome's six Vestal Virgins, each carefully selected as children\nfrom Rome's most aristocratic families. But now with her death,\nthere are only five, and a new priestess must be chosen. The six-year-old Licinia witnessed\nthe spectacle, never suspecting that a few days later,\nshe'd be chosen as the next Vestal Virgin. Her age, her patrician family lineage, and her apparent good health makes her the best candidate to serve the\ngoddess Vesta in the eyes of the Romans. Her parents are proud that their\ndaughter's been chosen. Licinia is afraid,\nbut she has no choice in the matter. She must serve the goddess\nfor at least the next 30 years. For the first ten years \nof Licinia's service, she's considered in training,\nlearning how to be a Vestal Virgin. Her most important duty is keeping vigil\nover the flame of Vesta, the virgin goddess of the hearth. Vesta doesn't have a statue\nlike other Roman gods and goddesses. Instead, she's represented by the flame\nwhich burns day and night in her temple located next to the Forum in the center\nof the city. Like all Vestal priestesses, Licinia\nspends part of each day on shift, watching and tending to the flame. The flame represents two things. The first is the continuation of Rome\nas a power in the world. The Romans believed that if the flame\ngoes out, the city's in danger. The flame also symbolizes the continuing\nvirginity of Vesta's priestesses. For the Romans, a Vestal's virginity\nsignaled not only her castitas, or modest spirit and body, but also her ritual purity. So Licinia knows she must never\nlet the flame go out. Her life, the lives of her fellow Vestals, and the safety of Rome itself \ndepends upon it. Licinia learns to collect water each day\nfrom a nearby fountain to cleanse the temple. She learns the Fasti, the calendar\nof sacred rituals and she watches while the senior\npriestesses conduct sacrifices. By the time Licinia \ncompletes her training, she's 16 years old. Licinia understands that \nthe way she must act is a reflection of the goddess she serves. When it's her turn to collect the water,\nshe keeps her eyes lowered to the ground. When she performs sacrifices,\nshe focuses intently on the task. Licinia directs her energy towards\nbeing the best priestess she can be. She's worried that someday the state\nwill claim her life for its own purposes to protect itself from danger. Licinia could be accused of incestum,\nmeaning unchastity, at any time and be sacrificed whether\nshe's innocent or guilty. Licinia fully understands now why her\npredecessor was buried alive. Ten years ago, \nthe flame of Vesta went out. The priestesses knew that they couldn't\nkeep it a secret. The future of Rome depended upon it. They went to the chief priest\nand he opened an investigation to discover why the flame had failed. Someone came forward and claimed\nthat one of the Vestals was no longer a virgin. That was the beginning of the end. The accused protested her innocence,\nbut it wasn't enough. She was tried and found guilty. That Vestal's death was meant\nto protect the city, but Licinia weeps for what has been lost\nand for what she knows now. Her own path was paved by the death\nof another, and her life could be taken just as easily for something as simple \nas a flame going out. "

        "text": "Even after writing eleven books \nand winning several prestigious awards, Maya Angelou couldn’t escape \nthe nagging doubt that she hadn’t really earned \nher accomplishments. Albert Einstein experienced \nsomething similar: he described himself \nas an “involuntary swindler” whose work didn’t deserve \nas much attention as it had received. Accomplishments at the level \nof Angelou’s or Einstein’s are rare, but their feeling of fraudulence \nis extremely common. Why can’t so many of us shake feelings that we haven’t earned \nour accomplishments, or that our ideas and skills \naren’t worthy of others’ attention? Psychologist Pauline Rose Clance \nwas the first to study this unwarranted sense of insecurity. In her work as a therapist, she noticed many of her undergraduate \npatients shared a concern: though they had high grades, they didn’t believe they deserved \ntheir spots at the university. Some even believed their acceptance \nhad been an admissions error. While Clance knew these fears \nwere unfounded, she could also remember feeling\nthe exact same way in graduate school. She and her patients experienced\nsomething that goes by a number of names-- imposter phenomenon, imposter experience, and imposter syndrome. Together with colleague Suzanne Imes, Clance first studied imposterism\nin female college students and faculty. Their work established pervasive\nfeelings of fraudulence in this group. Since that first study, the same thing has been established \nacross gender, race, age, and a huge range of occupations, though it may be more prevalent \nand disproportionately affect the experiences of underrepresented \nor disadvantaged groups. To call it a syndrome \nis to downplay how universal it is. It's not a disease or an abnormality, and it isn’t necessarily \ntied to depression, anxiety, or self-esteem. Where do these feelings \nof fraudulence come from? People who are highly skilled \nor accomplished tend to think others are just as skilled. This can spiral into feelings \nthat they don’t deserve accolades and opportunities over other people. And as Angelou and Einstein experienced, there’s often no threshold \nof accomplishment that puts these feelings to rest. Feelings of imposterism aren’t restricted \nto highly skilled individuals, either. Everyone is susceptible to a phenomenon \nknown as pluralistic ignorance, where we each doubt ourselves privately, but believe we’re alone \nin thinking that way because no one else voices their doubts. Since it’s tough to really know \nhow hard our peers work, how difficult they find certain tasks, or how much they doubt themselves, there’s no easy way to dismiss feelings \nthat we’re less capable than the people around us. Intense feelings of imposterism can prevent people \nfrom sharing their great ideas or applying for jobs \nand programs where they’d excel. At least so far, the most surefire way \nto combat imposter syndrome is to talk about it. Many people suffering \nfrom imposter syndrome are afraid that if they ask \nabout their performance, their fears will be confirmed. And even when \nthey receive positive feedback, it often fails to ease \nfeelings of fraudulence. But on the other hand, hearing that an advisor or mentor has\nexperienced feelings of imposterism can help relieve those feelings. The same goes for peers. Even simply finding out there’s a term \nfor these feelings can be an incredible relief. Once you’re aware of the phenomenon, you can combat your own imposter syndrome  by collecting \nand revisiting positive feedback. One scientist who kept blaming herself \nfor problems in her lab started to document the causes \nevery time something went wrong. Eventually, she realized most \nof the problems came from equipment failure, and came to recognize her own competence. We may never be able \nto banish these feelings entirely, but we can have open conversations \nabout academic or professional challenges. With increasing awareness \nof how common these experiences are, perhaps we can feel freer to be frank \nabout our feelings and build confidence \nin some simple truths: you have talent, you are capable, and you belong.

The woman had just given birth \nto their thirteenth child, and the growing family was quickly \nrunning out of food and money. The father walked into the woods \nto ponder their problem. After hours spent wandering \nthrough the trees, he encountered two shadowy silhouettes. The first figure appeared \nto be the man’s God, while the second resembled the Devil. Both figures offered to lighten \nthe man’s burden, and act as Godfather \nto his most recent child. But the man refused their offer— he wouldn’t entrust his son to those \nwho passed judgment on human life. He ventured deeper \ninto the tangled thicket. Here in the darkest part of the woods, \nthe father made out a third figure. Sunken eyes stared out of its gaunt face, \nwhich broke into a crooked smile. This was Death himself, \ncome to offer his services as Godfather. He promised to return \nwhen the child came of age, to bring him happiness and prosperity. The father— knowing that all people \nare equal in the eyes of Death— accepted his offer. Years later, when the child had grown \ninto an ambitious young man, his skeletal Godfather \ncame for his promised visit. In his gnarled hand \nhe held a flask containing the cure for all human ailments. Death had brought this flask \nfor his Godson, promising to make him a successful doctor. But the powerful potion \ncame with very strict rules. If his Godson encountered a sick person and Death was hovering \nat the top of their bed, the doctor could heal them with \njust a waft of the antidote’s fumes. But if Death lingered \nat the foot of the bed, he’d already claimed the patient \nas his own— and the doctor could do nothing for them. In time, the doctor’s potent potion \nand uncanny instincts became known throughout the land. He grew rich and famous, casting off \nthe hardships of his early life. When the king fell ill, he summoned \nthe famous physician to treat him. The doctor swept into the palace, \nready to show off his skills. But when he entered the king’s chamber, he was dismayed to see Death \nsettled at the foot of the bed. The doctor desperately wanted the glory \nof saving the king— even if it meant deceiving his Godfather. And so, he swiftly spun the bed around \nand reversed Death’s position, leaving the doctor free \nto administer the antidote. Death was livid. He warned his arrogant Godson \nthat if he ever cheated Death again, he would pay for it with his life. Death and the doctor \ncontinued their travels. After some time, the king’s messengers \ncame to collect the doctor yet again. The princess was gravely ill, and the king had promised incredible \nriches to anyone who could cure her. The doctor approached the princesses’ \nchamber with gold in his eyes. But upon seeing the sleeping princess, \nhis greed fell away. He was so struck by her grace, that he failed to notice \nDeath lurking by her feet. He swiftly healed the princess, but before she could even utter \nher thanks, Death had dragged \nhis lovesick Godson away. In an instant, \nthe palace dissolved around them. The doctor found himself \nin an immense cave lined with countless quivering candles,\neach representing the duration of a life. As punishment for his Godson’s \nfoolish attempt to master mortality, Death whittled his candle \ndown to its wick. Seeing his own dwindling light, the doctor felt the fear \nhe’d often glimpsed in his patients’ eyes. Desperately, he begged Death to transfer \nhis dying light onto a new candle. His Godfather considered the request— \nbut the doctor’s betrayal was too great. He loosened his bony grip, \nand his Godson’s candle fell to the floor. Death stood motionless, his inscrutable face \nfixed on the sputtering flame— until all that was left of the doctor \nwas a wisp of smoke. "

        "text": "Depression is the leading cause\nof disability in the world. In the United States, close to 10% of adults \nstruggle with depression. But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand\nthan, say, high cholesterol. One major source of confusion is\nthe difference between having depression and just feeling depressed. Almost everyone feels down\nfrom time to time. Getting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument, even a rainy day can bring on\nfeelings of sadness. Sometimes there's no trigger at all. It just pops up out of the blue. Then circumstances change, and those sad feelings disappear. Clinical depression is different. It's a medical disorder, and it won't go away \njust because you want it to. It lingers for at least \ntwo consecutive weeks, and significantly interferes \nwith one's ability to work, play, or love. Depression can have a lot\nof different symptoms: a low mood, loss of interest in things\nyou'd normally enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, poor concentration, restlessness or slowness, loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of suicide. If you have at least five\nof those symptoms, according to psychiatric guidelines, you qualify for a diagnosis of depression. And it's not just behavioral symptoms. Depression has physical manifestations\ninside the brain. First of all, there are changes that could be seen\nwith the naked eye and X-ray vision. These include smaller frontal lobes\nand hippocampal volumes. On a more microscale, depression is associated \nwith a few things: the abnormal transmission or depletion\nof certain neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, norepinephrine,\nand dopamine, blunted circadian rhythms, or specific changes in the REM\nand slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle, and hormone abnormalities, such as high cortisol and deregulation\nof thyroid hormones. But neuroscientists still don't have\na complete picture of what causes depression. It seems to have to do with a complex\ninteraction between genes and environment, but we don't have a diagnostic tool that can accurately predict where\nor when it will show up. And because depression symptoms\nare intangible, it's hard to know who might look fine\nbut is actually struggling. According to the National Institute\nof Mental Health, it takes the average person\nsuffering with a mental illness over ten years to ask for help. But there are very effective treatments. Medications and therapy complement\neach other to boost brain chemicals. In extreme cases,\nelectroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure\nin the patient's brain, is also very helpful. Other promising treatments, like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being investigated, too. So, if you know someone \nstruggling with depression, encourage them, gently, to seek out\nsome of these options. You might even offer to help\nwith specific tasks, like looking up therapists in the area, or making a list of questions\nto ask a doctor. To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable. If they feel guilty or ashamed, point out that depression \nis a medical condition, just like asthma or diabetes. It's not a weakness \nor a personality trait, and they shouldn't expect themselves\nto just get over it anymore than they could will themselves\nto get over a broken arm. If you haven't experienced \ndepression yourself, avoid comparing it to times\nyou've felt down. Comparing what they're experiencing\nto normal, temporary feelings of sadness can make them feel guilty for struggling. Even just talking about \ndepression openly can help. For example, research shows that asking\nsomeone about suicidal thoughts actually reduces their suicide risk. Open conversations about mental illness\nhelp erode stigma and make it easier \nfor people to ask for help. And the more patients seek treatment, the more scientists will learn\nabout depression, and the better the treatments will get. "

        "text": "If you lined up all \nthe blood vessels in your body, they'd be 95,000 kilometers long and everyday, they carry the equivalent\nof over 7,500 liters of blood, though that's actually the same four\nor five liters recycled over and over, delivering oxygen, and precious nutrients like glucose and amino acids\nto the body's tissues. All that blood exerts a force on\nthe muscular walls of the blood vessels. That force is called blood pressure, and it rises and falls\nwith the phases of the heartbeat. It's highest during systole, when the heart contracts to force\nblood through the arteries. This is your systolic blood pressure. When the heart is at rest between beats, blood pressure falls to its lowest value,\nthe diastolic pressure. A typical healthy individual produces\na systolic pressure between 90 and 120 millimeters of mercury, and diastolic pressure between 60 and 80. Taken together, a normal reading is a bit\nless than 120 over 80. The blood traverses \nthe landscape of the body through the pipes \nof the circulatory system. In any plumbing system, several things can increase the force\non the walls of the pipes: the properties of the fluid, extra fluid, or narrower pipes. So if the blood thickens, a higher pressure is needed to push it,\nso the heart will pump harder. A high-salt diet will lead \nto a similar result. The salt promotes water retention, and the extra fluid increases the blood\nvolume and blood pressure, and stress, \nlike the fight or flight response, releases hormones, like epinephrine\nand norepinephrine that constrict key vessels, increasing the resistance to flow\nand raising the pressure upstream. Blood vessels can usually handle\nthese fluctuations easily. Elastic fibers embedded in their walls\nmake them resilient, but if your blood pressure \nregularly rises above about 140 over 90, what we call hypertension, \nand stays there, it can cause serious problems. That's because the extra strain\non the arterial wall can produce small tears. When the injured tissue swells up, substances that respond \nto the inflammation, like white blood cells,\ncollect around the tears. Fat and cholesterol floating \nin the blood latch on, too, eventually building up to form a plaque that stiffens and thickens\nthe inner arterial wall. This condition is called\natherosclerosis, and it can have dangerous consequences. If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot\nforms on top of the tear, clogging the already narrowed pipe. If the clot is big enough, it can completely block the flow of\noxygen and nutrients to cells downstream. In vessels that feed the heart, that will cause a heart attack, when oxygen-deprived cardiac\nmuscle cells start to die. If the clot cuts off \nblood flow to the brain, it causes a stroke. Dangerously clogged blood vessels\ncan be widened by a procedure called\nan angioplasty. There, doctors thread a wire\nthrough the vessel to the obstructed site, and then place a deflated \nballoon catheter over the wire. When the balloon is inflated,\nit forces the passageway open again. Sometimes a rigid tube\ncalled a stent is placed in a vessel \nto held hold it open, letting the blood flow freely to replenish the oxygen-starved \ncells downstream. Staying flexible under pressure \nis a tough job for arteries. The fluid they pump \nis composed of substances that can get sticky and clog them, and your typical healthy heart\nbeats about 70 times a minute, and at least 2.5 billion times\nduring an average lifetime. That may sound like an insurmountable\namount of pressure, but don't worry, your arteries\nare well suited for the challenge. "

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo all have in common\nwith the heroes of ancient myths? (Roar) What if I told you they are all variants\nof the same hero? Do you believe that? Joseph Campbell did. He studied myths from all over the world\nand published a book called \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces,\" retelling dozens of stories and explaining how each\nrepresents the mono-myth, or Hero's Journey. So, what is the \"hero's journey\"? Think of it as a cycle. The journey begins and ends\nin a hero's ordinary world, but the quest passes\nthrough an unfamiliar, special world. Along the way, there are some key events. Think about your favorite book or movie. Does it follow this pattern? Status quo, that's where we start. 1:00: Call to Adventure. The hero receives a mysterious message. An invitation, a challenge? 2:00: Assistance The hero needs some help,\nprobably from someone older, wiser. 3:00: Departure The hero crosses the threshold\nfrom his normal, safe home, and enters the special\nworld and adventure. We're not in Kansas anymore. 4:00: Trials Being a hero is hard work: our hero solves a riddle, slays a monster, escapes from a trap. 5:00: Approach It's time to face the biggest ordeal,\nthe hero's worst fear. (Roar) 6:00: Crisis This is the hero's darkest hour. He faces death and possibly even dies, only to be reborn. 7:00: Treasure (Roar) As a result, the hero\nclaims some treasure, special recognition, or power. 8:00: Result This can vary between stories. Do the monsters bow down before the hero, or do they chase him as he flees\nfrom the special world? 9:00: Return After all that adventure,\nthe hero returns to his ordinary world. 10:00: New Life This quest has changed the hero;\nhe has outgrown his old life. 11:00: Resolution All the tangled plot lines\nget straightened out. 12:00: Status Quo, but upgraded to a new level. Nothing is quite the same\nonce you are a hero. Many popular books and movies follow this ancient\nformula pretty closely. But let's see how well \"The Hunger Games\"\nfits the hero's journey template. When does Katniss Everdeen\nhear her call to adventure that gets the story moving? When her sister's name\nis called from the lottery. How about assistance? Is anyone going to help\nher on her adventure? Haymitch. What about departure? Does she leave her ordinary world? She gets on a train to the capital. OK, so you get the idea. What do you have in common\nwith Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo? Well, you're human, just like them. The Hero's Journey myth\nexists in all human cultures and keeps getting updated, because we humans reflect on our world through symbolic stories of our own lives. You leave your comfort zone, have an experience that transforms you, and then you recover and do it again. You don't literally slay\ndragons or fight Voldemort, but you face problems just as scary. Joseph Campbell said, \"In the cave you fear to enter\nlies the treasure you seek.\" What is the symbolic\ncave you fear to enter? Auditions for the school play? Baseball tryouts? Love? Watch for this formula in books,\nmovies, and TV shows you come across. You will certainly see it again. But also be sensitive\nto it in your own life. Listen for your call to adventure. Accept the challenge. Conquer your fear\nand claim the treasure you seek. And then, do it all over again. "

        "text": "Imagine something small enough to float\non a particle of dust that holds the keys to understanding\ncancer, virology, and genetics. Luckily for us, such a thing exists in the form \nof trillions upon trillions of human lab-grown cells\ncalled HeLa. Let's take a step back for a second. Scientists grow human cells in the lab\nto study how they function, understand how diseases develop, and test new treatments without\nendangering patients. To make sure that they can repeat\nthese experiments over and over, and compare the results \nwith other scientists, they need huge populations \nof identical cells that can duplicate themselves \nfaithfully for years, but until 1951, all human cell lines\nthat researchers tried to grow had died after a few days. Then a John Hopkins scientist\nnamed George Gey received a sample of \na strange looking tumor: dark purple, shiny, jelly-like. This sample was special. Some of its cells just kept dividing, and dividing, and dividing. When individual cells died, generations of copies took their place\nand thrived. The result was an endless source of\nidentical cells that's still around today. The very first immortal human cell line. Gey labeled it \"HeLa\" after the patient\nwith the unusual tumor, Henrietta Lacks. Born on a tobacco farm in Virginia, she lived in Baltimore with her husband\nand five children. She died of aggressive cervical cancer a few months after her tumorous cells\nwere harvested, and she never knew about them. So what's so special about the cells\nfrom Henrietta Lacks that lets them survive\nwhen other cell lines die? The short answer is\nwe don't entirely know. Normal human cells have built-in\ncontrol mechanisms. They can divide about 50 times\nbefore they self destruct in a process called apoptosis. This prevents the propagation\nof genetic errors that creep in after \nrepeated rounds of division. But cancer cells ignore these signals,\ndividing indefinitely and crowding out normal cells. Still, most cell lines eventually die off,\nespecially outside the human body. Not HeLa, though, and that's the part\nwe can't yet explain. Regardless, when Dr. Gey realized he had\nthe first immortal line of human cells, he sent samples \nto labs all over the world. Soon the world's first \ncell production facility was churning out \n6 trillion HeLa cells a week, and scientists put them to work\nin an ethically problematic way, building careers and fortunes\noff of Henrietta's cells without her or her family's consent,\nor even knowledge until decades later. The polio epidemic was at its peak\nin the early 50s. HeLa cells, which easily took up\nand replicated the virus, allowed Jonas Salk to test his vaccine. They've been used to study diseases, including measles, mumps, HIV, and ebola. We know that human \ncells have 46 chromosomes because a scientist working with HeLa\ndiscovered a chemcial that makes chromosomes visible. HeLa cells themselves actually have\naround 80 highly mutated chromosomes. HeLa cells were the first to be cloned. They've traveled to outer space. Telomerase, an enzyme that helps cancer cells evade\ndestruction by repairing their DNA, was discovered first in HeLa cells. In an interesting turn of fate, thanks to HeLa, we know that cervical\ncancer can be caused by a virus called HPV and now there's a vaccine. HeLa-fueled discoveries have filled\nthousands of scientific papers, and that number is probably even higher\nthan anyone knows. HeLa cells are so resilient that they \ncan travel on almost any surface: a lab worker's hand, a piece of dust, invading cultures of other cells \nand taking over like weeds, countless cures, patents and discoveries\nall made thanks to Henrieta Lacks.

Rose Eveleth details the science and history behind spicy foods, giving insights into why some people continue to pay the painful price for a little spice.\n\nLesson by Rose Eveleth, animation by Flaming Medusa Studios Inc.",
        "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qD0_yWgifDM/hqdefault.jpg",
        "text": "Why does your mouth feel like it's on fire when you eat a spicy pepper? And how do you soothe the burn? Why does wasabi make your eyes water? And how spicy is the spiciest spice? Let's back up a bit. First, what is spiciness? Even though we often say that something tastes spicy, it's not actually a taste, like sweet or salty or sour. Instead, what's really happening is that certain compounds in spicy foods activate the type of sensory neurons called polymodal nociceptors. You have these all over your body, including your mouth and nose, and they're the same receptors that are activated by extreme heat. So, when you eat a chili pepper, your mouth feels like it's burning because your brain actually thinks it's burning. The opposite happens when you eat something with menthol in it. The cool, minty compound is activating your cold receptors. When these heat-sensitive receptors are activated, your body thinks it's in contact with a dangerous heat source and reacts accordingly. This is why you start to sweat, and your heart starts beating faster. The peppers have elicited the same fight-or-flight response with which your body reacts to most threats. But you may have noticed that not all spicy foods are spicy in the same way. And the difference lies in the types of compounds involved. The capsaicin and piperine, found in black pepper and chili peppers, are made up of larger, heavier molecules called alkylamides, and those mostly stay in your mouth. Mustard, horseradish, and wasabi are made up of smaller molecules, called isothiocyanates, that easily float up into your sinuses. This is why chili peppers burn your mouth, and wasabi burns your nose. The standard measure of a food's spiciness is its rating on the Scoville scale, which measures how much its capsaicin content can be diluted before the heat is no longer detectable to humans. A sweet bell pepper gets 0 Scoville heat units, while Tabasco sauce clocks in between 1,200-2,400 units. The race to create the hottest pepper is a constant battle, but two peppers generally come out on top: The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper. These peppers measure between 1.5 and 2 million Scoville heat units, which is about half the units found in pepper spray. So, why would anyone want to eat something that causes such high levels of pain? Nobody really knows when or why humans started eating hot peppers. Archaeologists have found spices like mustard along with human artifacts dating as far back as 23,000 years ago. But they don't know whether the spices were used for food or medication or just decoration. More recently, a 6,000 year old crockpot, lined with charred fish and meat, also contained mustard. One theory says that humans starting adding spices to food to kill off bacteria. And some studies show that spice developed mostly in warmer climates where microbes also happen to be more prevalent. But why we continue to subject ourselves to spicy food today is still a bit of a mystery. For some people, eating spicy food is like riding rollercoasters; they enjoy the ensuing thrill, even if the immediate sensation is unpleasant. Some studies have even shown that those who like to eat hot stuff are more likely to enjoy other adrenaline-rich activities, like gambling. The taste for spicy food may even be genetic. And if you're thinking about training a bit, to up your tolerance for spice, know this: According to some studies, the pain doesn't get any better. You just get tougher. In fact, researchers have found that people who like to eat spicy foods don't rate the burn any less painful than those who don't. They just seem to like the pain more. So, torment your heat receptors all you want, but remember, when it comes to spicy food, you're going to get burned. "

The viceroy of New Spain had invited them\nto test the young woman’s knowledge by posing the most difficult questions \nthey could muster. But Juana successfully answered \nevery challenge, from complicated equations to \nphilosophical queries. Observers would later liken the scene to “a royal galleon fending \noff a few canoes.” The woman who faced this interrogation \nwas born in the mid-17th century. At that time, Mexico had been a Spanish \ncolony for over a century, leading to a complex and \nstratified class system. Juana’s maternal grandparents \nwere born in Spain, making them members of Mexico’s \nmost esteemed class. But Juana was born out of wedlock, and\nher father – a Spanish military captain – left her mother, Doña Isabel, \nto raise Juana and her sisters alone. Fortunately, her grandfather’s \nmoderate means ensured the family \na comfortable existence. And Doña Isabel set a strong example \nfor her daughters, successfully managing one of her father’s \ntwo estates, despite her illiteracy and the \nmisogyny of the time. It was perhaps this precedent that \ninspired Juana’s lifelong confidence. At age three, she secretly followed her \nolder sister to school. When she later learned that higher \neducation was open only to men, she begged her mother to let her attend\nin disguise. Her request denied, Juana found solace \nin her grandfather’s private library. By early adolescence, she’d mastered \nphilosophical debate, Latin, and the Aztec language Nahuatl. Juana’s precocious intellect attracted \nattention from the royal court in Mexico City, and when she was sixteen, the viceroy and his wife took her in \nas their lady-in-waiting. Here, her plays and poems alternately \ndazzled and outraged the court. Her provocative poem Foolish Men infamously criticized sexist \ndouble standards, decrying how men corrupt women \nwhile blaming them for immorality. Despite its controversy, her work still \ninspired adoration, and numerous proposals. But Juana was more interested in knowledge\nthan marriage. And in the patriarchal \nsociety of the time, there was only one place \nshe could find it. The Church, while still under the zealous \ninfluence of the Spanish Inquisition, would allow Juana to retain her \nindependence and respectability while remaining unmarried. At age 20, she entered the Hieronymite \nConvent of Santa Paula and took on her new name: \nSor Juana Inés de la Cruz. For years, Sor Juana was considered a \nprized treasure of the church. She wrote dramas, comedies, and treatises \non philosophy and mathematics, in addition to religious music and poetry. She accrued a massive library, and was visited by many \nprominent scholars. While serving as the convent’s treasurer \nand archivist, she also protected the livelihoods of her \nniece and sisters from men who tried to exploit them. But her outspokenness ultimately brought\nher into conflict with her benefactors. In 1690, a bishop published Sor Juana’s \nprivate critique of a respected sermon. In the publication, he admonished Sor Juana to devote herself \nto prayer rather than debate. She replied that God would not have given\nwomen intellect if he did not want them to use it. The exchange caught the attention of the \nconservative Archbishop of Mexico. Slowly, Sor Juana was stripped of her \nprestige, forced to sell her books \nand give up writing. Furious at this censorship, but unwilling\nto leave the church, she bitterly renewed her vows. In her last act of defiance, she signed \nthem “I, the worst of all,” in her own blood. Deprived of scholarship, Sor Juana threw \nherself into charity work, and in 1695, she died of an illness she \ncontracted while nursing her sisters. Today, Sor Juana has been recognized \nas the first feminist in the Americas. She’s the subject of countless \ndocumentaries, novels, and operas, and appears on Mexico’s 200-peso banknote. In the words of Nobel laureate \nOctavio Paz: “It is not enough to say that Sor Juana’s \nwork is a product of history; we must add that history is also \na product of her work.” "

        "text": "The attacking infantry advances steadily, their elephants already having \nbroken the defensive line. The king tries to retreat, but enemy \ncavalry flanks him from the rear. Escape is impossible. But this isn’t a real war– nor is it just a game. Over the roughly one-and-a-half millennia \nof its existence, chess has been known as a tool \nof military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, \nand a benchmark of genius. While our earliest records of chess \nare in the 7th century, legend tells that the game’s origins \nlie a century earlier. Supposedly, when the youngest prince \nof the Gupta Empire was killed in battle, his brother devised a way of representing\nthe scene to their grieving mother. Set on the 8x8 ashtapada board used for\nother popular pastimes, a new game emerged with two key features: different rules for moving \ndifferent types of pieces, and a single king piece whose fate \ndetermined the outcome. The game was originally \nknown as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for \"four divisions.\" But with its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name \nand terminology– \"chess,\" derived from \"shah,\" meaning \nking, and “checkmate” from \"shah mat,\" or “the king is helpless.” After the 7th century Islamic conquest \nof Persia, chess was introduced to the Arab world. Transcending its role as a \ntactical simulation, it eventually became a rich source \nof poetic imagery. Diplomats and courtiers used chess terms \nto describe political power. Ruling caliphs became avid \nplayers themselves. And historian al-Mas’udi considered the \ngame a testament to human free will compared to games of chance. Medieval trade along the Silk Road carried\nthe game to East and Southeast Asia, where many local variants developed. In China, chess pieces were placed at \nintersections of board squares rather than inside them, as in the native \nstrategy game Go. The reign of Mongol leader Tamerlane saw \nan 11x10 board with safe squares called citadels. And in Japanese shogi, captured pieces \ncould be used by the opposing player. But it was in Europe that chess began to \ntake on its modern form. By 1000 AD, the game had become part \nof courtly education. Chess was used as an allegory for different social classes performing \ntheir proper roles, and the pieces were re-interpreted \nin their new context. At the same time, the Church remained \nsuspicious of games. Moralists cautioned against devoting \ntoo much time to them, with chess even being briefly \nbanned in France. Yet the game proliferated, and the 15th century saw it cohering into\nthe form we know today. The relatively weak piece of advisor was \nrecast as the more powerful queen– perhaps inspired by the recent surge \nof strong female leaders. This change accelerated the game’s pace, and as other rules were popularized, treatises analyzing common openings \nand endgames appeared. Chess theory was born. With the Enlightenment era, the game \nmoved from royal courts to coffeehouses. Chess was now seen as an expression \nof creativity, encouraging bold moves and dramatic plays. This \"Romantic\" style reached its peak \nin the Immortal Game of 1851, where Adolf Anderssen managed a checkmate after sacrificing his queen \nand both rooks. But the emergence of formal competitive \nplay in the late 19th century meant that strategic calculation would \neventually trump dramatic flair. And with the rise of international \ncompetition, chess took on a new \ngeopolitical importance. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union devoted great resources\nto cultivating chess talent, dominating the championships for the rest \nof the century. But the player who would truly upset \nRussian dominance was not a citizen of another country but an IBM computer called Deep Blue. Chess-playing computers had been \ndeveloped for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph \nover Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine \nhad defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software is capable of \nconsistently defeating the best human players. But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products \nof human ingenuity.

        "text": "Your rich, eccentric uncle \njust passed away, and you and your 99 nasty relatives have\nbeen invited to the reading of his will. He wanted to leave \nall of his money to you, but he knew that if he did,\nyour relatives would pester you forever. So he is banking on the fact that he taught you everything \nyou need to know about riddles. Your uncle left the following \nnote in his will: \"I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it together,\nyou will share the money evenly. However, if you are the first to find\nthe pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work, you will get the entire inheritance \nall to yourself. Good luck.\" The lawyer takes you and your 99 relatives\nto a secret room in the mansion that contains 100 lockers, each hiding a single word. He explains: Every relative is assigned a number\nfrom 1 to 100. Heir 1 will open every locker. Heir 2 will then \nclose every second locker. Heir 3 will change the status\nof every third locker, specifically if it's open, \nshe'll close it, but if it's closed, she'll open it. This pattern will continue until\nall 100 of you have gone. The words in the lockers that remain\nopen at the end will help you crack the code for the safe. Before cousin Thaddeus can even start\ndown the line, you step forward and tell the lawyer\nyou know which lockers will remain open. But how? Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is realizing that the number\nof times a locker is touched is the same as the number of factors\nin the locker number. For example, in locker #6, Person 1 will open it, Person 2 will close it, Person 3 will open it, and Person 6 will close it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 \nare the factors of 6. So when a locker has an even number\nof factors it will remain closed, and when it has an odd number of factors, it will remain open. Most of the lockers \nhave an even number of factors, which makes sense because factors\nnaturally pair up. In fact, the only lockers that have\nan odd number of factors are perfect squares because those have one factor that when\nmultiplied by itself equals the number. For Locker 9, 1 will open it, 3 will close, and 9 will open it. 3 x 3 = 9, but the 3 can only be counted once. Therefore, every locker that is \na perfect square will remain open. You know that these ten lockers \nare the solution, so you open them immediately\nand read the words inside: \"The code is the first five lockers\ntouched only twice.\" You realize that the only lockers \ntouched twice have to be prime numbers since each only has two factors: 1 and itself. So the code is 2-3-5-7-11. The lawyer brings you to the safe, and you claim your inheritance. Too bad your relatives were always\ntoo busy being nasty to each other to pay attention \nto your eccentric uncle's riddles. "

        "text": "As the warrior slept, a snake coiled around his face. Instead of a threat, his wife saw an omen– a fearsome power that would lead\nher husband to either glory or doom. For now, however, he was only a slave – one of millions taken from the territories conquered by Rome to work the mines, till the fields, or fight for the crowd’s entertainment. A nomadic Thracian from \nwhat is now Bulgaria, he had served in the Roman Army \nbut was imprisoned for desertion. His name was Spartacus. Spartacus had been brought to Capua \nby Batiatus, a lanista, or trainer of gladiators. And life at the ludus, or gladiator \nschool, was unforgiving. New recruits were forced to swear an oath “to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, \nand to be killed by the sword,” and to obey their master’s will \nwithout question. But even harsh discipline couldn’t \nbreak Spartacus’s spirit. In 73 BCE, Spartacus led 73 other slaves to seize knives and skewers from the \nkitchen and fight their way out, hijacking a wagon of gladiator equipment \nalong the way. They were done fighting for others– now, they fought for their freedom. When the news reached Rome, the Senate was too busy with wars in \nSpain and the Pontic Empire to worry about some unruly slaves. Unconcerned, praetor Claudius Glaber took \nan army of three thousand men to the rebel’s refuge at Mount Vesuvius, and blocked off the only passage \nup the mountain. All that remained was to wait and \nstarve them out– or so he thought. In the dead of night, the rebels lowered themselves down the \ncliffside on ropes made from vines, and flanked Glaber’s unguarded camp. Thus began the legend of Rome’s \ndefiant gladiator. As news of the rebellion spread, its ranks swelled with escaped slaves, deserting soldiers, and hungry peasants. Many were untrained, but Spartacus’s clever tactics \ntransformed them into an effective guerrilla force. A second Roman expedition led by praetor\nVarinius, was ambushed while the officer bathed. To elude the remaining Roman forces, the rebels used their enemy’s corpses as\ndecoy guards, stealing Varinius’s own horse \nto aid their escape. Thanks to his inspiring victories \nand policy of distributing spoils equally, Spartacus continued attracting followers, and gained control of villages where new weapons could be forged. The Romans soon realized they were \nno longer facing ragtag fugitives, and in the spring of 72 BCE, the Senate retaliated with \nthe full force of two legions. The rebels left victorious, but many lives were lost in the battle, including Spartacus’ lieutenant Crixus. To honor him, \nSpartacus held funeral games, forcing his Roman prisoners to play the \nrole his fellow rebels had once endured. By the end of 72 BCE, Spartacus’ army was a massive force of \nroughly 120,000 members. But those numbers proved \ndifficult to manage. With the path to the Alps clear, Spartacus wanted to march \nbeyond Rome’s borders, where his followers would be free. But his vast army had grown brash. Many wanted to continue pillaging, while others dreamed of \nmarching on Rome itself. In the end, the rebel army turned south– forgoing what would be their \nlast chance at freedom. Meanwhile, Marcus Licinius Crassus \nhad assumed control of the war. As Rome’s wealthiest citizen, he pursued Spartacus \nwith eight new legions, eventually trapping the rebels \nin the toe of Italy. After failed attempts to build rafts, and a stinging betrayal by local pirates, the rebels made a desperate run \nto break through Crassus’s lines– but it was no use. Roman reinforcements were returning \nfrom the Pontic wars, and the rebels’ ranks and \nspirits were broken. In 71 BCE, they made their last stand. Spartacus nearly managed to reach Crassus \nbefore being cut down by centurions. His army was destroyed, and 6000 captives were crucified \nalong the Appian Way– a haunting demonstration \nof Roman authority. Crassus won the war, but it is not his legacy which echoes \nthrough the centuries. Thousands of years later, the name of the slave who made the \nworld’s mightiest empire tremble has become synonymous with freedom– and the courage to fight for it. "

        "text": "What would you do if you thought \nyour country was on the path to tyranny? If you saw one man gaining too much power,\nwould you try to stop him? Even if that man was\none of your closest friends and allies? These were the questions haunting\nRoman Senator Marcus Junius Brutus in 44 BCE, the year Julius Caesar \nwould be assassinated. Opposing unchecked power \nwasn't just a political matter for Brutus; it was a personal one. He claimed descent\nfrom Lucius Junius Brutus, who had helped overthrow the tyrannical\nking known as Tarquin the Proud. Instead of seizing power himself, the elder Brutus\nled the people in a rousing oath to never again allow a king to rule. Rome became a republic based on the principle that no one man\nshould hold too much power. Now, four and a half centuries later,\nthis principle was threatened. Julius Ceasar's rise \nto the powerful position of consul had been dramatic. Years of military triumphs \nhad made him the wealthiest man in Rome. And after defeating his rival\nPompey the Great in a bitter civil war, his power was at its peak. His victories and initiatives, \nsuch as distributing lands to the poor, had made him popular with the public, and many senators vied for his favor \nby showering him with honors. Statues were built, \ntemples were dedicated, and a whole month was renamed,\nstill called July today. More importantly, the title of dictator, meant to grant\ntemporary emergency powers in wartime, had been bestowed upon Caesar \nseveral times in succession. And in 44 BCE, \nhe was made dictator perpetuo, dictator for a potentially unlimited term. All of this was too much for the senators who feared a return to the monarchy\ntheir ancestors had fought to abolish, as well as those whose \nown power and ambition were impeded by Caesar's rule. A group of conspirators \ncalling themselves the liberators began to secretly discuss\nplans for assassination. Leading them were\nthe senator Gaius Cassius Longinus and his friend and brother-in-law, Brutus. Joining the conspiracy was not \nan easy choice for Brutus. Even though Brutus had sided with Pompey \nin the ill-fated civil war, Caesar had personally intervened \nto save his life, not only pardoning him\nbut even accepting him as a close advisor and elevating him to important posts. Brutus was hesitant to conspire against\nthe man who had treated him like a son, but in the end, Cassius's insistence and Brutus's own fear\nof Caesar's ambitions won out. The moment they had been waiting for\ncame on March 15. At a senate meeting held shortly before Caesar was to depart\non his next military campaign, as many as 60 conspirators surrounded him, unsheathing daggers from their togas\nand stabbing at him from all sides. As the story goes, Caesar struggled fiercely\nuntil he saw Brutus. Despite the famous line, \"Et tu, Brute?\" \nwritten by Shakespeare, we don't know Caesar's actual dying words. Some ancient sources claim\nhe said nothing, while others record the phrase, \n\"And you, child?\", fueling speculation that Brutus may have\nactually been Caesar's illegitimate son. But all agree that when \nCaesar saw Brutus among his attackers, he covered his face and gave up the fight, falling to the ground \nafter being stabbed 23 times. Unfortunately for Brutus, he and the other conspirators \nhad underestimated Caesar's popularity among the Roman public, many of whom saw \nhim as an effective leader, and the senate as a corrupt aristocracy. Within moments of Caesar's assassination,\nRome was in a state of panic. Most of the other senators had fled, while the assassins barricaded themselves\non the Capitoline Hill. Mark Antony, \nCaesar's friend and co-consul, was swift to seize the upper hand, delivering a passionate speech \nat Caesar's funeral days later that whipped the crowd into a frenzy \nof grief and anger. As a result, the liberators \nwere forced out of Rome. The ensuing power vacuum \nled to a series of civil wars, during which Brutus, \nfacing certain defeat, took his own life. Ironically, the ultimate result would be the opposite of what\nthe conspirators had hoped to accomplish: the end of the Republic and the concentration of power \nunder the office of Emperor. Opinions over the assassination of Caesar \nwere divided from the start and have remained so. As for Brutus himself, few historical figures have inspired \nsuch a conflicting legacy. In Dante's \"Inferno,\" he was placed \nin the very center of Hell and eternally chewed by Satan himself\nfor his crime of betrayal. But Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" described him as one of the most\nvirtuous and benevolent people to have lived. The interpretation of Brutus as either\na selfless fighter against dictatorship or an opportunistic traitor has shifted with the tides \nof history and politics. But even today, over 2000 years later, questions about the price of liberty, the conflict between \npersonal loyalties and universal ideals, and unintended consequences\nremain more relevant than ever.

        "text": "Mastering any physical skill, be it performing a pirouette, playing an instrument, or throwing a baseball, takes practice. Practice is the repetition of an action\nwith the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease,\nspeed, and confidence. So what does practice do in our brains\nto make us better at things? Our brains have two kinds \nof neural tissue: grey matter and white matter. The grey matter processes information\nin the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli\nto nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up\nof fatty tissue and nerve fibers. In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from\nthe brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers\ncalled axons to our muscles. So how does practice or repetition\naffect the inner workings of our brains? The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance\ncalled myelin. And it's this myelin covering, or sheath,\nthat seems to change with practice. Myelin is similar to insulation\non electrical cables. It prevents energy loss from electrical\nsignals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently\nalong neural pathways. Some recent studies in mice suggest\nthat the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath\nthat insulates the axons. And the more layers, the greater\nthe insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway\nfor information connecting your brain to your muscles. So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes \nto muscle memory, muscles themselves \ndon't really have memory. Rather, it may be the myelination\nof neural pathways that gives these athletes \nand performers their edge with faster and more efficient \nneural pathways. There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours,\ndays, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill. While we don't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery isn't simply about\nthe amount of hours of practice. It's also the quality and effectiveness\nof that practice. Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge \nof one's current abilities. So if effective practice is the key, how can we get the most \nout of our practice time? Try these tips. Focus on the task at hand. Minimize potential distractions by turning\noff the computer or TV and putting your cell phone \non airplane mode. In one study, researchers observed 260\nstudents studying. On average, those students were able to stay \non task for only six minutes at a time. Laptops, smartphones, \nand particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions. Start out slowly or in slow-motion. Coordination is built with repetitions,\nwhether correct or incorrect. If you gradually increase the speed\nof the quality repetitons, you have a better chance \nof doing them correctly. Next, frequent repetitions with allotted\nbreaks are common practice habits of elite performers. Studies have shown that many top athletes,\nmusicians, and dancers spend 50-60 hours per week on activities\nrelated to their craft. Many divide their time \nused for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions\nof limited duration. And finally, practice in your brain\nin vivid detail. It's a bit surprising, but a number\nof studies suggest that once a physical motion \nhas been established, it can be reinforced \njust by imagining it. In one study, 144 basketball players\nwere divided into two groups. Group A physically practiced \none-handed free throws while Group B only \nmentally practiced them. When they were tested at the end\nof the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced\nplayers in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount. As scientists get closer to unraveling\nthe secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice\nwill only improve. In the meantime, effective practice\nis the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential. "

        "text": "Your research team has found\na prehistoric virus preserved in the permafrost and isolated it for study. After a late night working, you're just closing up the lab\nwhen a sudden earthquake hits and knocks out the power. As the emergency generators kick in,\nan alarm confirms your worst fears: all the sample vials have broken. The virus is contained for now, but unless you can destroy it, the vents will soon open\nand unleash a deadly airborne plague. Without hesitation, you grab\nyour HazMat suit and get ready to save the world. The lab is a four by four compound\nof 16 rooms with an entrance on the northwest corner\nand an exit at the southeast. Each room is connected to the adjacent\nones by an airlock, and the virus has been released\nin every room except the entrance. To destroy it, you must enter each\ncontaminated room and pull its emergency \nself-destruct switch. But there's a catch. Because the security system \nis on lockdown, once you enter the contaminated room, you can't exit without \nactivating the switch, and once you've done so, you won't be able to go \nback in to that room. You start to draw out possible\nroutes on a pad of paper, but nothing seems to get you\nto the exit without missing at least one room. So how can you destroy the virus\nin every contaminated room and survive to tell the story? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If your first instinct is to try to graph\nyour possible moves on a grid, you've got the right idea. This puzzle is related to \nthe Hamiltonian path problem named after the 19th century Irish \nmathematician William Rowan Hamilton. The challenge \nof the path problem is to find whether a given graph\nhas a Hamiltonian path. That's a route that visits \nevery point within it exactly once. This type of problem, classified \nas NP-complete, is notoriously difficult when the graph\nis sufficiently large. Although any proposed solution\ncan be easily verified, we have no reliable formula or shortcut\nfor finding one, or determining that one exists. And we're not even sure\nif it's possible for computers to reliably find \nsuch solutions, either. This puzzle adds a twist\nto the Hamiltonian path problem in that you have to start \nand end at specific points. But before you waste a ton of graph paper, you should know that a true\nHamiltonian path isn't possible with these end points. That's because the rooms form a grid\nwith an even number of rooms on each side. In any grid with that configuration, a Hamiltonian path that starts and \nends in opposite corners is impossible. Here's one way of understanding why. Consider a checkerboard grid with\nan even number of squares on each side. Every path through it will alternate\nblack and white. These grids will all also have an even\ntotal number of squares because an even number times\nand even number is even. So a Hamiltonian path on an\neven-sided grid that starts on black will have to end on white. And one that starts on white\nwill have to end on black. However, in any grid with even\nnumbered sides, opposite corners are the same color, so it's impossible to start and end\na Hamiltonian path on opposite corners. It seems like you're out of luck, unless you look at the rules carefully\nand notice an important exception. It's true that once you activate\nthe switch in a contaminated room, it's destroyed and you can never go back. But there's one room \nthat wasn't contaminated - the entrance. This means that you can leave it once\nwithout pulling the switch and return there when you've\ndestroyed either of these two rooms. The corner room may have\nbeen contaminated from the airlock opening,\nbut that's okay because you can destroy the entrance\nafter your second visit. That return trip gives you four options\nfor a successful route, and a similar set of options if you\ndestroyed this room first. Congratulations. You've prevented\nan epidemic of apocalyptic proportions, but after such a stressful episode,\nyou need a break. Maybe you should take up that recent\njob offer to become a traveling salesman. "

It’d all started when Thor, along with his fleet-footed human servant\nThjalfi and Loki, the trickster god, set out on a journey to Jotunheim, \nland of the giants. Along the way, they’d met \na giant named Skrymir, who offered to accompany them and\neven carry their provisions in his bag. But when they made camp,\nSkrymir dozed off and Thor couldn’t untie the sack. Frustrated and hungry, Thor tried \nto wake the giant three times by striking his head with his hammer \nMjolnir as hard as he could. But each time, Skrymir thought \nit was only a falling acorn and went back to sleep. The next morning, Skrymir departed and eventually, the travelers reached \na massive fortress called Utgard. Inside the long hall, \nthey met the king of giants, Utgard-Loki, who greeted his guests with a challenge: each of them was to prove they were \nthe best at some particular skill. Loki went first, declaring himself \nthe world’s fastest eater. To test him, the king summoned \nhis servant Logi and the two were placed at either \nend of a long trough stuffed with food. Loki ate his way inward \nwith blinding speed. But when the contestants \nmet in the center, Loki saw that his adversary \nhad not only eaten just as much food, but also the bones \nand even the trough itself. Next was Thjalfi, who could \noutrun anything in the wild. The king summoned an ethereal-looking \ngiant named Hugi, who outraced Thjalfi easily. But the boy would not give up \nand demanded a rematch. This time, Thjalfi finished close behind and the king admitted he’d never \nseen a human run so fast. Thjalfi tried a third time, \nrunning like his life depended on it, but Hugi was even faster than before. Finally, it was Thor’s turn. The king offered him a drinking horn, saying all his men \ncould drain it in two gulps. Thor raised it to his lips and drank the surprisingly \ncold and salty mead in the longest gulp he could muster. Then a second. Then a third. But the level of the mead \nin the horn was only slightly lowered. To test Thor’s renowned strength, the king\noffered a seemingly easy challenge: lift his pet cat off the ground. But this cat was as tall as Thor. Every time he tried to lift it, \nit arched its back, and straining with all his godly might, \nhe only managed to lift one paw. Enraged, Thor demanded \nto wrestle any of the giants. The king summoned \nthe giants’ old nursemaid, Elli. Though the woman looked frail, \nThor couldn’t overpower her and grew weaker the longer he struggled,\nuntil he was brought to one knee. The three companions prepared \nto leave, disappointed and humbled. But as the king escorted them out, he revealed that nothing in the castle \nhad been what it seemed. Loki lost the eating contest because \nhis opponent Logi was wildfire itself, devouring everything in its path. Thjalfi couldn’t outrun Hugi because\nHugi was the embodiment of thought, always faster than action. And even Thor couldn’t defeat Elli, \nor old age, which weakens everyone eventually. As for the other challenges, \nthey had also been illusions. The drinking horn \nwas filled with the ocean, and Thor had drained\nenough to cause the tides. The cat was the serpent \nthat encircles the world, and Thor’s efforts shifted the earth. And Skrymir had been \nUtgard-Loki in disguise, deflecting Thor’s hammer-blows to form\nvalleys in the surrounding mountains. The giant congratulated \nthem on their prowess, which so frightened him he would \nnever allow them in his land again. Thor and his companions failed \nthe challenges presented to them. But in trying to achieve the impossible, they’d pushed themselves \nharder than ever before and changed the world \nin ways no one had expected. "

        "text": "Most history books will tell you the Roman\nEmpire fell in the fifth century CE. But this would’ve come as a great surprise\nto the millions of people who lived in the Roman Empire up\nthrough the Middle Ages. This medieval Roman Empire, which we usually refer \nto today as the Byzantine Empire, began in 330 CE. That’s when Constantine,\nthe first Christian emperor, moved the capital of the Roman Empire \nto a new city called Constantinople, which he founded on the site of the\nancient Greek city Byzantion. When the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 and the Empire’s western provinces \nwere conquered by barbarians, Constantine’s Eastern capital remained \nthe seat of the Roman emperors. There, generations of emperors ruled \nfor the next 11 centuries. Sharing continuity with \nthe classical Roman Empire gave the Byzantine empire a technological\nand artistic advantage over its neighbors, whom Byzantines considered barbarians. In the ninth century, \nvisitors from beyond the frontier were astonished \nat the graceful stone arches and domes of the imperial palace in Constantinople. A pair of golden lions flanked \nthe imperial throne. A hidden organ would make the lions \nroar as guests fell on their knees. Golden birds\nsung from a nearby golden tree. Medieval Roman engineers \neven used hydraulic engines to raise the imperial throne \nhigh into the air. Other inherited aspects \nof ancient Roman culture could be seen in emperors’ clothing, from traditional military garb to togas, and in the courts, which continued to use Roman law. Working-class Byzantines would’ve also \nhad similar lives to their Ancient Roman counterparts; many farmed or plied a specific trade, such as ceramics, leatherworking, fishing, weaving, or manufacturing silk. But, of course, the Byzantine Empire didn’t just rest \non the laurels of Ancient Rome. Their artists innovated, creating vast \nmosaics and ornate marble carvings. Their architects constructed\nnumerous churches, one of which, called Hagia Sophia, had a dome so high it was said to be\nhanging on a chain from heaven. The Empire was also home to great\nintellectuals such as Anna Komnene. As imperial princess in the 12th century, Anna dedicated her life \nto philosophy and history. Her account of her father’s reign\nis historians’ foremost source for Byzantine political history \nat the time of the first crusade. Another scholar, Leo the Mathematician, invented a system of beacons that ran the\nwidth of the empire— what’s now Greece and Turkey. Stretching more than 700 kilometers, this system allowed the edge of the Empire\nto warn the emperor of invading armies within one hour\nof sighting them at the border. But their advances couldn’t \nprotect the Empire forever. In 1203, an army of French \nand Venetian Crusaders made a deal with a man \nnamed Alexios Angelos. Alexios was the son of a deposed emperor, and promised the crusaders vast riches and support to help him retake \nthe throne from his uncle. Alexios succeeded, but after a year, the population rebelled and Alexios \nhimself was deposed and killed. So Alexios’s unpaid army turned \ntheir aggression on Constantinople. They lit massive fires, which destroyed countless works of ancient\nand medieval art and literature, leaving about one-third \nof the population homeless. The city was reclaimed 50 years later \nby the Roman Emperor Michael Palaiologos, but his restored Empire never regained\nall the territory the Crusaders had conquered. Finally, in 1453, Ottoman Emperor Mehmed\nthe Conqueror captured Constantinople, bringing a conclusive end \nto the Roman Empire. Despite the Ottoman conquest, many Greek-speaking inhabitants \nof the Eastern Mediterranean continued to call themselves Romans \nuntil the early 21st century. In fact, it wasn’t until the Renaissance that the term “Byzantine Empire” \nwas first used. For Western Europeans, the Renaissance was about \nreconnecting with the wisdom of antiquity. And since the existence of a\nmedieval Roman Empire suggested there were Europeans \nwho’d never lost touch with antiquity, Western Europeans wanted to draw \nclear lines between the ages. To better distinguish the classical, \nLatin-speaking, pagan Roman Empire from the medieval, \nGreek-speaking, Christian Roman Empire, scholars renamed \nthe latter group Byzantines. And thus, 100 years after it had\nfallen, the Byzantine Empire was born. "

        "text": "Every day, the sands of the Sahara Desert\nreach temperatures up to 80° Celsius. Stretching over roughly\nnine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about \n22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year. That’s well over 100 times more energy \nthan humanity consumes annually. So, could covering the desert with solar \npanels solve our energy problems for good? Solar panels work when light particles hit\ntheir surface with enough energy to knock electrons \nout of their stable bonds. On their journey back to stability, \nthese electrons produce electricity. However, there’s a limit to how much power\npanels can generate. Solar panels can only interact \nwith certain wavelengths of light, making it impossible to convert \nover half the sunlight they receive. And even light particles they can convert\noften bounce off them without ever hitting an electron. But thanks to clever scientists \nand engineers and substantial government investment, solar panels are generating \nmore electricity than ever. Anti-reflective coatings and patterns \non the panels’ surface create more opportunities for incoming \nlight particles to hit electrons. These techniques have increased commercial\nsolar panel efficiency from the low-teens to 25%, with experimental models reaching\nup to 47%. What’s more, solar has gotten \n89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains\nfor other technologies that use the same materials. Together, these factors have \nmade solar power the cheapest source of electricity \non Earth. Countries including India, China, \nEgypt, and the US, have already taken\nthese new panels into the desert. Their massive solar farms range \nfrom 15 to 56 square kilometers, and when the sun is high in the sky, these plants can provide energy for hundreds of thousands\nof local residents. But these farms also get\nextremely hot. Light that solar cells don’t convert \nor reflect is absorbed as heat, which reduces a panel’s efficiency. And the cooling systems employed by many\nfarms can use huge amounts of energy powering fans or moving water \nto maintain optimal temperatures. Even with these systems, solar panels \nin the desert absorb far more heat than the natural sandy environment. This hasn’t been a problem\non the scale of existing solar farms. But if we tried to cover the Sahara, this effect could create massive changes\nin the region's climate. Constructing solar farms already\ndisrupts local ecosystems, but a plant of this scale could \ndramatically transform the desert landscape. Thankfully, solar panels\naren’t our only option. And some of the largest solar plants \nin the world are trying a new approach: giant mirrors. Morocco’s Noor Power Plant, which will eventually cover roughly \n30 square kilometers of the Sahara, is a concentrated solar power plant. This design reflects light \nonto a receiver, which converts that energy to heat,\nand then electricity. These mirrors still create a dangerous\ntemperature shift for local wildlife, but they have less potential\nto transform the landscape. And since it takes time for the materials\nbeing heated to cool off, these plants often continue producing\nelectricity past sunset. Whether they use panels or mirrors, industrial solar farms are often easy to\nfit into existing energy infrastructure. However, getting their electricity beyond\nlocal power grids is much more difficult. Some countries are working on ways to\nconnect electric grids across the globe. And many farm store energy\nin massive batteries, or convert their electricity \ninto clean gas that can be used later. But right now, these techniques are still\ntoo expensive and inefficient to rely on. Worse still, industrial renewables\ncan share some of the same problems as fossil fuels, relying on destructive mining operations \nand carbon-emitting global supply chains. Fortunately, solar can\nexist on many scales, from industrial solar farms \nto smaller installations that power individual buildings \nand rural communities. These projects can supplement energy use\nor provide a passive source of energy for regions off the grid. And since solar panels rely \non a few simple components, they’re quick to install \nand relatively easy to update. In fact, it’s this flexibility \nthat enabled solar to become so cheap and ubiquitous \nover the last decade. So if we want to keep up with humanity's\nrising energy use, we'll need answers both big and small. "

        "text": "From Shakespeare’s plays \nto modern TV dramas, the unscrupulous schemer for whom \nthe ends always justify the means has become a familiar character type \nwe love to hate. So familiar, in fact, that for centuries we’ve had a single word to describe \nsuch characters: Machiavellian. But is it possible that we’ve been using \nthat word wrong this whole time? The early 16th century statesman Niccoló \nMachiavelli wrote many works of history, philosophy, \nand drama. But his lasting notoriety comes from a \nbrief political essay known as The Prince, framed as advice to current \nand future monarchs. Machiavelli wasn’t the first to do this– in fact there was an entire tradition of \nworks known as “mirrors for princes” going back to antiquity. But unlike his predecessors, Machiavelli didn’t try to describe an \nideal government or exhort his audience to rule \njustly and virtuously. Instead, he focused on the \nquestion of power– how to acquire it, and how to keep it. And in the decades after it was published, The Prince gained a diabolical reputation. During the European Wars of Religion, both Catholics and Protestants \nblamed Machiavelli for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny\ncommitted by their opponents. By the end of the century, Shakespeare was using “Machiavel” to \ndenote an amoral opportunist, leading directly to our popular use of \n“Machiavellian” as a synonym for manipulative villainy. At first glance, The Prince’s reputation as a manual for \ntyranny seems well-deserved. Throughout, Machiavelli appears entirely \nunconcerned with morality, except insofar as it’s helpful or harmful \nto maintaining power. For instance, princes are told to \nconsider all the atrocities necessary to seize power, and to commit them in a single stroke to ensure future stability. Attacking neighboring territories and \noppressing religious minorities are mentioned as effective ways of \noccupying the public. Regarding a prince’s personal behavior, Machiavelli advises keeping up the \nappearance of virtues such as honesty or generosity, but being ready to abandon them as soon \nas one’s interests are threatened. Most famously, he notes that for a ruler, “it is much safer to be feared \nthan loved.” The tract even ends with an appeal to \nLorenzo de’ Medici, the recently installed ruler of Florence, urging him to unite the fragmented \ncity-states of Italy under his rule. Many have justified Machiavelli as \nmotivated by unsentimental realism and a desire for peace in an Italy torn by\ninternal and external conflict. According to this view, Machiavelli was the first to understand \na difficult truth: the greater good of political stability is worth whatever unsavory tactics \nare needed to attain it. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin suggested \nthat rather than being amoral, The Prince hearkens back to \nancient Greek morality, placing the glory of the state above the \nChristian ideal of individual salvation. But what we know about Machiavelli might\nnot fit this picture. The author had served in his native \nFlorence for 14 years as a diplomat, staunchly defending its elected \nrepublican government against would-be monarchs. When the Medici family seized power, he not only lost his position, but was even tortured and banished. With this in mind, it’s possible to read the pamphlet \nhe wrote from exile not as a defense of princely rule, but a scathing description \nof how it operates. Indeed, Enlightenment figures like Spinoza saw it as warning free citizens of the various ways in which they can be\nsubjugated by aspiring rulers. In fact, both readings might be true. Machiavelli may have written a manual for \ntyrannical rulers, but by sharing it, he also revealed \nthe cards to those who would be ruled. In doing so, he revolutionized political philosophy, laying the foundations for Hobbes and \nfuture thinkers to study human affairs based on their \nconcrete realities rather than preconceived ideals. Through his brutal and shocking honesty, Machiavelli sought to shatter popular \ndelusions about what power really entails. And as he wrote to a friend \nshortly before his death, he hoped that people would “learn the way \nto Hell in order to flee from it.\" "

        "text": "From sailors who were turned into pigs, nymphs that sprouted into trees, and a gaze that converted \nthe beholder to stone, Greek mythology brims with shape-shifters. The powerful gods usually changed \ntheir own forms at will, but for mortals, the mutations \nwere often unwanted. One such unnerving transformation \nbefell the spinner Arachne. Arachne was the daughter \nof a tradesman who spent his days dying cloth \nthe deepest shades of purple. She had a flair for spinning \nthe finest threads, weaving them into flowing fabric, and creating magnificent tapestries. People flocked to watch her hands \nflying across her loom, as if thread sprung directly \nfrom her fingertips. But as praise for her work grew, \nso did her pride. Arachne could often be heard \nboasting about her skills, declaring that her talent surpassed \nanyone else’s—mortal or divine. She refused to see weaving \nas a gift from the gods. Rather, she flaunted it \nas her own personal genius. Unfortunately, the goddess of wisdom \nand crafts, Athena, overheard Arachne \nmaking these claims. Planning to teach \nthe ungrateful girl a lesson, Athena disguised herself as an old woman\nand stole amongst the mortals. She berated Arachne in public— how dare the weaver claim\nherself greater than the gods? But Arachne only laughed, \nbarely looking up from her loom. Provoked, the old woman threw off\nher cloak to reveal her true form. If Arachne insisted on defaming the gods, Athena would challenge her \nto a contest directly. Masking her shock at the appearance \nof the grey-eyed goddess, Arachne accepted the challenge. Athena drew up her own glittering loom \nas a great crowd gathered to watch. The weavers began, \neyes fixed and shuttles blurring. Athena conjured \nwisps of cloud from above and slender threads of grass \nfrom below in a spectacle of strength. She wove tremendous scenes \nthat showed the power of the gods: Poseidon riding the waves, Zeus firing thunderbolts, and Apollo hurtling across the sky. In Athena’s splendid tapestry, \nthe glory of the gods dwarfed mortal life. But Arachne had no interest \nin boosting godly egos. Her tapestry showed the gods\nabusing their power: squabbling amongst themselves, drinking and bragging, and meddling in the lives of mortals. She represented Zeus as a philanderer,\ntransfiguring himself to ensnare women: a swan for Leda, a bull for Europa, a shower of gold for Danae. Arachne then turned\nto the misdemeanors of other gods, from Pluto’s abduction of Persephone to Bacchus’s wild pursuit of Erigone. Even though she cast the gods \nin the most unflattering light, Arachne’s work shone \nwith her dazzling skill. Her tapestry was almost alive, filled with movement \nand lustrous colors that winked triumphantly. When Athena saw Arachne's undeniably\nbetter and flagrantly subversive work, she flew into a rage \nand turned on the human weaver. Arachne’s glee dimmed as she felt her body\nshrinking and contorting. Her fingers waved wildly \nas her arms stuck to her sides, and black hair\nsprouted all over her body. The goddess left Arachne with a single \nspool of thread unfurling from her belly, a slim reminder of her human talent. For challenging the assumption\nthat the gods were untouchable, Athena had shrunk her adversary \ninto the first spider. To this day, Arachne and her children spin\nout her penance— or is it undaunted persistence?— in the shadows of giants. "

        "text": "Way before the first selfie, the ancient Greeks and Romans had a myth about someone a little too obsessed \nwith his own image. In one telling, Narcissus was a handsome guy wandering\nthe world in search of someone to love. After rejecting a nymph named Echo, he caught a glimpse \nof his own reflection in a river, and fell in love with it. Unable to tear himself away, Narcissus drowned. A flower marked the spot of where he died,\nand we call that flower the Narcissus. The myth captures \nthe basic idea of narcissism, elevated and sometimes \ndetrimental self-involvement. But it's not just a personality type\nthat shows up in advice columns. It's actually a set of traits classified\nand studied by psychologists. The psychological definition of narcissism\nis an inflated, grandiose self-image. To varying degrees, narcissists think\nthey're better looking, smarter, and more important than other people, and that they deserve special treatment. Psychologists recognize two forms\nof narcissism as a personality trait: grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. There's also narcissistic \npersonality disorder, a more extreme form,\nwhich we'll return to shortly. Grandiose narcissism \nis the most familiar kind, characterized by extroversion, dominance, and attention seeking. Grandiose narcissists pursue \nattention and power, sometimes as politicians, celebrities, or cultural leaders. Of course, not everyone who pursues\nthese positions of power is narcissistic. Many do it for very positive reasons, like reaching their full potential, or helping make people's lives better. But narcissistic individuals seek power for the status \nand attention that goes with it. Meanwhile, vulnerable narcissists\ncan be quiet and reserved. They have a strong sense of entitlement, but are easily threatened or slighted. In either case, the dark side of\nnarcissism shows up over the long term. Narcissists tend to act selfishly, so narcissistic leaders may make risky\nor unethical decisions, and narcissistic partners may be dishonest\nor unfaithful. When their rosy view of themselves\nis challenged, they can become resentful and aggressive. It's like a disease where the sufferers\nfeel pretty good, but the people around them suffer. Taken to the extreme, this behavior is classified \nas a psychological disorder called narcissistic personality disorder. It affects one to two percent\nof the population, more commonly men. It is also a diagnosis \nreserved for adults. Young people, especially children,\ncan be very self-centered, but this might just be a normal\npart of development. The fifth edition of the American\nPsychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual describes several traits associated\nwith narcissistic personality disorder. They include a grandiose view of oneself, problems with empathy, a sense of entitlement, and a need for admiration or attention. What makes these trait a true\npersonality disorder is that they take over people's lives\nand cause significant problems. Imagine that instead of caring\nfor your spouse or children, you used them as a source\nof attention or admiration. Or imagine that instead of seeking constructive feedback \nabout your performance, you instead told everyone \nwho tried to help you that they were wrong. So what causes narcissism? Twin studies show \na strong genetic component, although we don't know \nwhich genes are involved. But environment matters, too. Parents who put their child\non a pedestal can foster grandiose narcissism. And cold, controlling parents\ncan contribute to vulnerable narcissism. Narcissism also seems to be higher in cultures that value individuality\nand self-promotion. In the United States, for example, narcissism as a personality trait\nhas been rising since the 1970s, when the communal focus of the 60s gave way to the self-esteem movement and a rise in materialism. More recently, social media has multiplied\nthe possibilities for self-promotion, though it's worth noting that there's no clear evidence\nthat social media causes narcissism. Rather, it provides narcissists a means\nto seek social status and attention. So can narcissists improve \non those negative traits? Yes! Anything that promotes honest reflection\non their own behavior and caring for others, like psychotherapy or practicing \ncompassion towards others, can be helpful. The difficulty is it can be challenging for people with \nnarcissistic personality disorder to keep working at self-betterment. For a narcissist, self-reflection is hard\nfrom an unflattering angle.

        "text": "In 2004, a new company called Vemma Nutrition started offering a life-changing \nopportunity to earn full time income \nfor part time work. Vemma’s offer was open to everybody, regardless of prior experience \nor education. There were only two steps to start \nget started earning: purchase a $500-600 kit \nof their liquid nutrition products, and recruit two more members \nto do the same. Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly, becoming a global operation that brought in 30,000 new members \nper month at its peak. There was just one problem— while the company generated $200 million\nof annual revenue by 2013, the vast majority of participants \nearned less than they paid in. Vemma was eventually charged with \noperating a pyramid scheme: a common type of fraud where members make money by recruiting more people to buy in. Typically, the founder solicits an initial\ngroup of people to buy in and promote the scheme. They are then encouraged to recruit others and promised part of the money \nthose people invest, while the founder also takes a share. The pattern repeats for each group \nof new participants, with money from recent arrivals funneled \nto those who recruited them. This differs from a Ponzi scheme, where the founders recruit new members and secretly use their fees to \npay existing members, who think the payments come \nfrom a legitimate investment. As a pyramid scheme grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for new \nrecruits to make money. That’s because the number of participants\nexpands exponentially. Take a structure where each person has \nto recruit six more to earn a profit. The founder recruits six people to start, and each of them recruits six more. There are 36 people in that second\nround of recruits, who then each recruit 6 people— a total of 216 new recruits. By the twelfth round of recruiting, the 2.1 billion newest members \nwould have to recruit over 13 billion more people total \nto make money– more than the entire world population. In this scenario, the most recent recruits, over 80% of the scheme’s participants, lose all the money they paid in. And in real life, many earlier joiners lose out too. Pyramid schemes are illegal \nin most countries, but they can be difficult to detect. They are presented as many \ndifferent things, including gifting groups, investment clubs, and multi-level \nmarketing businesses. The distinction between pyramid schemes \nand legitimate multi-level marketing can be particularly hazy. In theory, the difference is that the members of the multi-level \nmarketing companies primarily earn compensation from selling\na particular product or a service to retail customers, while pyramid schemes primarily compensate\nmembers for recruitment of new sellers. In practice, though, many multi-level marketing companies make \nit all but impossible for members to profit purely \nthrough sales. And many pyramid schemes, \nlike Vemma Nutrition, disguise themselves as legal multi-level\nmarketing businesses, using a product or service to hide the\npay-and-recruit structure. Many pyramid schemes also capitalize \non already existing trust within churches, immigrant communities, \nor other tightly knit groups. The first few members are encouraged \nto report a good experience before they actually start \nmaking a profit. Others in their network follow \ntheir example, and the schemes balloon in size before it comes clear that most members\naren’t actually profiting. Often, the victims are \nembarrassed into silence. Pyramid schemes entice people with the\npromise of opportunity and empowerment. So when members don’t end up making money, they can blame themselves \nrather than the scheme, thinking they weren’t tenacious enough \nto earn the returns promised. Some victims keep trying, investing in multiple schemes, and losing money each time. In spite of all these factors, there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme. Time pressure is one red flag— be wary of directives to “act now or \nmiss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Promises of large, life-altering\namounts of income are also suspect. And finally, a legitimate multi-level \nmarketing business shouldn’t require members to pay for the\nopportunity to sell a product or service. Pyramid schemes can be incredibly \ndestructive to individuals, communities, and even entire countries. But you can fight fire with fire by sending this video to three \npeople you know, and encouraging them to do the same. "

But if our body doesn’t create vitamins, how do they get into our system? Ginnie Trinh Nguyen describes what vitamins are, how they get into our bodies -- and why they are so crucial.\n\nLesson by Ginnie Trinh Nguyen, animation by The Moving Company Animation Studio.",

        "text": "A, C, E, D, B, K. No, this isn't some random,\nout of order alphabet. These are vitamins,\nand just like letters build words, they're the building blocks\nthat keep the body running. Vitamins are organic compounds we need\nto ingest in small amounts to keep functioning. They're the body's builders, defenders\nand maintenance workers, helping it to build muscle and bone,\nmake use of nutrients, capture and use energy\nand heal wounds. If you need convincing about\nvitamin value, just consider the plight of \nolden day sailors, who had no access to vitamin-rich\nfresh produce. They got scurvy. But vitamin C,\nabundant in fruits and vegetables, was the simple antidote to this disease. While bacteria, fungi and plants\nproduce their own vitamins, our bodies can't, so we have to get\nthem from other sources. So how does the body get\nvitamins from out there into here? That's dependent on the form\nthese compounds take. Vitamins come in two types: lipid-soluble and \nwater-soluble, and the difference between them \ndetermines how the body transports and stores vitamins, \nand gets rid of the excess. The water-solubles are vitamin C and B Complex vitamins that are made up of\neight different types that each do something unique. These are dissolved in the watery parts\nof fruits, vegetables and grains, meaning their passage through the body\nis relatively straightforward. Once inside the system,\nthese foods are digested and the vitamins within them are\ntaken up directly by the bloodstream. Because blood plasma is water-based, water-soluble vitamins C and B have their\ntransport cut out for them and can move around freely \nwithin the body. For lipid-soluble vitamins,\ndissolved in fat and found in foods like diary,\nbutter and oils, this trip into the blood is a little\nmore adventurous. These vitamins make it through\nthe stomach and the intestine, where an acidic substance\ncalled bile flows in from the liver, breaking up the fat and preparing it for\nabsorption through the intestinal wall. Because fat-soluble vitamins can't make\nuse of the blood's watery nature, they need something else \nto move them around, and that comes from proteins that attach\nto the vitamins and act like couriers, transporting fat-solubles into the blood\nand around the body. So, this difference between water-\nor fat-soluble vitamins determines how they get into the blood, but also how they're stored \nor rejected from the body. The system's ability to circulate\nwater-soluble vitamins in the bloodstream so easily means that most of them can be passed\nout equally easily via the kidneys. Because of that, \nmost water-soluble vitamins need to be replenished on a daily basis\nthrough the food we eat. But fat-soluble vitamins have\nstaying power because they can be packed into the liver\nand in fat cells. The body treats these parts like a pantry, storing the vitamins there and rationing\nthem out when needed, meaning we shouldn't overload\non this type of vitamin because the body is generally \nwell stocked. Once we figured the logistics\nof transport and storage, the vitamins are left to do the work\nthey came here to do in the first place. Some, like many of the B Complex vitamins,\nmake up coenzymes, whose job it is to help enzymes \nrelease the energy from food. Other B vitamins then help the body\nto use that energy. From vitamin C, you get the ability to\nfight infection and make collagen, a kind of tissue that forms \nbones and teeth and heals wounds. Vitamin A helps make white blood cells,\nkey in the body's defense, helps shape bones and improves vision \nby keeping the cells of the eye in check. Vitamin D gathers calcium and phosphorus \nso we can make bones, and vitamin E works as an antioxidant, getting rid of elements in the body\nthat can damage cells. Finally, from Vitamin K, we score\nthe ability to clot blood, since it helps make the proteins\nthat do this job. Without this vitamin variety, humans face deficiencies that \ncause a range of problems, like fatigue, nerve damage, \nheart disorders, or diseases like rickets and scurvy. On the other hand, too much of any\nvitamin can cause toxicity in the body, so there goes the myth that loading\nyourself with supplements is a great idea. In reality, it's all about getting the\nbalance right, and hitting that vitamin jackpot. "

That competitor just experienced \nthe phenomenon known as \"choking,\" where despite months, \neven years, of practice, a person fails right when it matters most. Choking is common in sports, where performance often occurs \nunder intense pressure and depends on key moments. And yet, performance anxiety \nalso haunts public speakers, contestants in spelling bees, and even world-famous musicians. Most people intuitively\nblame it on their nerves, but why does being nervous \nundermine expert performance? There are two sets of theories, which both say that primarily, choking \nunder pressure boils down to focus. First, there are the distraction theories. These suggest that performance suffers \nwhen the mind is preoccupied with worries, doubts, or fears, instead of focusing its attention\non performing the task at hand. When relevant and irrelevant thoughts \ncompete for the same attention, something has to give. The brain can only process \nso much information at once. Tasks that challenge working memory, the mental “scratch pad” we use to temporarily store phone numbers \nand grocery lists, are especially vulnerable to pressure. In a 2004 study, \na group of university students were asked to perform math problems, some easy, others more complex \nand memory-intensive. Half the students completed both problem\ntypes with nothing at stake, while the others completed them \nwhen calm and under pressure. While everyone did well \non the easy problems, those who were stressed \nperformed worse on the more difficult, \nmemory-intensive tasks. Explicit monitoring theories make up \nthe second group of explanations for choking under pressure. They’re concerned with how pressure can cause people to overanalyze\nthe task at hand. Here, the logic goes that \nonce a skill becomes automatic, thinking about its precise mechanics \ninterferes with your ability to do it. Tasks we do unconsciously seem to be\nmost vulnerable to this kind of choking. A study on competitive golfers compared \ntheir performance when instructed to simply focus on\nputting as accurately as possible, versus when they were primed \nto be acutely aware of the mechanics of their putting stroke. Golfers usually perform \nthis action subconsciously, so those who suddenly tuned in \nto the precise details of their own moves also became worse \nat making accurate shots. Choking may not be inevitable \nfor everyone though. Research suggests that some are\nmore susceptible than others, especially those who are self-conscious, anxious, and afraid of being judged \nnegatively by others. So, how can we avoid choking \nwhen it really counts? First, it helps to practice \nunder stressful conditions. In a study on expert dart players, researchers found that those \nwho hadn’t practiced under stress performed worse when anxious, compared to those who had \nbecome accustomed to pressure. Secondly, many performers extol the \nvirtues of a pre-performance routine, whether it’s taking a few deep breaths, repeating a cue word, or doing a rhythmic sequence of movements. Studies on golfing, bowling, \nand water polo find that short rituals can lead \nto more consistent and accurate performance under pressure. And thirdly, researchers have shown that having an external focus \non the ultimate goal works better than an internal focus, where someone is tuned into the mechanics \nof what they’re doing. A study of experienced golfers revealed \nthat those who hit chip shots while focused on the flight of the ball performed significantly better than those\nwho focused on the motion of their arms. So, perhaps we can modify \nthat age-old saying: practice, under pressure, with focus, and with that glorious end goal in sight, makes perfect. "

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we think about learning, we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall, books open on their desks, listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of the room. But in psychology, learning means something else. To psychologists, learning is a long-term change in behavior that's based on experience. Two of the main types of learning are called classical conditioning and operant, or instrumental, conditioning. Let's talk about classical conditioning first. In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiments on dogs. He showed dogs some food and rang a bell at the same time. After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food. They would learn that when they heard the bell, they would get fed. Eventually, just ringing the bell made the dogs salivate. They learned to expect food at the sound of a bell. You see, under normal conditions, the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate. We call the food an unconditioned stimulus, and we call salivation the unconditioned response. Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak. However, when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food with something that was previously neutral, like the sound of a bell, that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus. And so classical conditioning was discovered. We see how this works with animals, but how does it work with humans? In exactly the same way. Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot. She says, \"Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit,\" and then gives you the most painful shot you've ever had. A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up. He starts to put a mirror in your mouth to examine your teeth, and he says, \"Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit.\" Even though you know the mirror won't hurt, you jump out of the chair and run, screaming from the room. When you went to get a shot, the words, \"This won't hurt a bit,\" became a conditioned stimulus when they were paired with pain of the shot, the unconditioned stimulus, which was followed by your conditioned response of getting the heck out of there. Classical conditioning in action. Operant conditioning explains how consequences lead to changes in voluntary behavior. So how does operant conditioning work? There are two main components in operant conditioning: reinforcement and punishment. Reinforcers make it more likely that you'll do something again, while punishers make it less likely. Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative, but this doesn't mean good and bad. Positive means the addition of a stimulus, like getting dessert after you finish your veggies, and negative means the removal of a stimulus, like getting a night of no homework because you did well on an exam. Let's look at an example of operant conditioning. After eating dinner with your family, you clear the table and wash the dishes. When you're done, your mom gives you a big hug and says, \"Thank you for helping me.\" In this situation, your mom's response is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely to repeat the operant response, which is to clear the table and wash the dishes. Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives. There aren't many things we do that haven't been influenced at some point by operant conditioning. We even see operant conditioning in some extraordinary situations. One group of scientists showed the power of operant conditioning by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs. Using food as a positive reinforcer, scientists have taught pigeons to select paintings by Monet over those by Picasso. When showed works of other artists, scientists observed stimulus generalization as the pigeons chose the Impressionists over the Cubists. Maybe next they'll condition the pigeons to paint their own masterpieces. "

        "text": "This chimpanzee stumbles \nacross a windfall of overripe plums. Many of them have split open, drawing him \nto their intoxicating fruity odor. He gorges himself and begins to experience some… \nstrange effects. This unwitting ape \nhas stumbled on a process that humans will eventually harness to create \nbeer, wine, and other alcoholic drinks. The sugars in overripe fruit \nattract microscopic organisms known as yeasts. As the yeasts feed on the fruit sugars \nthey produce a compound called ethanol— the type of alcohol \nin alcoholic beverages. This process is called fermentation. Nobody knows exactly when humans began \nto create fermented beverages. The earliest known evidence \ncomes from 7,000 BCE in China, where residue in clay pots has revealed that people \nwere making an alcoholic beverage from fermented rice, millet, \ngrapes, and honey. Within a few thousand years, cultures all over the world \nwere fermenting their own drinks. Ancient Mesopotamians and Egyptians \nmade beer throughout the year from stored cereal grains. This beer \nwas available to all social classes, and workers \neven received it in their daily rations. They also made wine, but because the climate \nwasn’t ideal for growing grapes, it was a rare and expensive delicacy. By contrast, in Greece and Rome, \nwhere grapes grew more easily, wine was as readily available \nas beer was in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Because yeasts \nwill ferment basically any plant sugars, ancient peoples made alcohol from whatever crops and plants \ngrew where they lived. In South America, \npeople made chicha from grains, sometimes adding hallucinogenic herbs. In what’s now Mexico, \npulque, made from cactus sap, was the drink of choice, while East Africans \nmade banana and palm beer. And in the area that’s now Japan, \npeople made sake from rice. Almost every region of the globe \nhad its own fermented drinks. As alcohol consumption \nbecame part of everyday life, some authorities latched onto effects \nthey perceived as positive— Greek physicians \nconsidered wine to be good for health, and poets \ntestified to its creative qualities. Others were more concerned \nabout alcohol’s potential for abuse. Greek philosophers promoted temperance. Early Jewish and Christian writers \nin Europe integrated wine into rituals but considered excessive intoxication \na sin. And in the middle east, \nAfrica, and Spain, an Islamic rule \nagainst praying while drunk gradually solidified \ninto a general ban on alcohol. Ancient fermented beverages \nhad relatively low alcohol content. At about 13% alcohol, the by-products wild yeasts \ngenerate during fermentation become toxic and kill them. When the yeasts die, fermentation stops \nand the alcohol content levels off. So for thousands of years, \nalcohol content was limited. That changed \nwith the invention of a process called distillation. 9th century Arabic writings \ndescribe boiling fermented liquids to vaporize the alcohol in them. Alcohol boils \nat a lower temperature than water, so it vaporizes first. Capture this vapor, cool it down, \nand what’s left is liquid alcohol much more concentrated \nthan any fermented beverage. At first, these stronger spirits \nwere used for medicinal purposes. Then, spirits became \nan important trade commodity because, unlike beer and wine, \nthey didn’t spoil. Rum made from sugar harvested in European colonies \nin the Caribbean became a staple for sailors and was traded to North America. Europeans brought \nbrandy and gin to Africa and traded it \nfor enslaved people, land, and goods like palm oil and rubber. Spirits became \na form of money in these regions. During the Age of Exploration, spirits played a crucial role \nin long distance sea voyages. Sailing from Europe to east Asia \nand the Americas could take months, and keeping water fresh \nfor the crews was a challenge. Adding a bucket of brandy \nto a water barrel kept water fresh longer because alcohol is a preservative \nthat kills harmful microbes. So by the 1600s, alcohol had gone from \nsimply giving animals a buzz to fueling global trade and exploration— \nalong with all their consequences. As time went on, its role in human society \nwould only get more complicated. "

        "text": "On a cold winter night in 1916, Felix Yusupov anxiously prepared \nto pick up his dinner guest. If all went as planned, \nhis guest would be dead by morning, though four others had already tried\nand failed to finish him off. The Russian monarchy \nwas on the brink of collapse, and to Yusupov \nand his fellow aristocrats, the holy man they’d invited to dinner \nwas the single cause of it all. But who was he, and how could a single monk \nbe to blame for the fate of an empire? Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin \nbegan his life in Siberia, born in 1869 to a peasant family. He might have lived a life of obscurity \nin his small village, if not for his conversion \nto the Russian Orthodox Church in the 1890s. Inspired by the humbled monks \nthat wandered endlessly from holy site to holy site, he spent years on pilgrimages \nacross Russia. On his travels, strangers were captivated \nby Rasputin’s magnetic presence. Some even believed he had mystical gifts \nof prediction and healing. Despite Rasputin’s heavy drinking, \npetty theft, and promiscuity, his reputation as a monk \nquickly spread beyond Siberia and attracted both laypeople \nand powerful Orthodox clergymen. When he finally reached the capital, \nSt. Petersburg, Rasputin used \nhis charisma and connections to win favor with the imperial family’s \nspiritual advisor. In November 1905, Rasputin was finally introduced \nto Russian Tsar Nicholas II. Nicholas and his wife Alexandra \ndevoutly believed in the Orthodox Church, as well as in mysticism \nand supernatural powers, and this Siberian holy man \nhad them transfixed. It was a particularly tumultuous period \nfor Russia and their family. The monarchy \nwas barely clinging to control after the Revolution of 1905. Their political struggles \nwere only intensified by personal turmoil: Alexei, the heir to the throne, had a life-threatening blood disease \ncalled hemophilia. When Alexei suffered \na severe medical crisis in 1912, Rasputin advised his parents \nto reject treatment from doctors. Alexei’s health improved, \ncementing the royal family’s belief that Rasputin had magical healing powers, and guaranteeing \nhis privileged place on the royal court. Today, we know that \nthe doctors had prescribed aspirin, a drug that worsens hemophilia. After this incident, \nRasputin made a prophecy: if he died, \nor the royal family deserted him, both their son and their crown \nwould soon be gone. Outside the royal family, \npeople had mixed views on Rasputin. On one hand, peasants regarded him \nas one of their own, amplifying their often-unheard voice \nto the monarchy. But nobles and clergymen \ncame to despise his presence. Rasputin never ceased \nhis scandalous behavior, and they were skeptical \nof his so-called powers and thought he was corrupting \nthe royal family. By the end of World War I, they were convinced \nthe only way to maintain order was to eliminate this sham \nof a holy man. With this conviction, Yusupov began \nto plot Rasputin’s assassination. Though the exact details \nremain mysterious, our best guess at how it all unfolded \ncomes from Yusupov’s memoirs. He served Rasputin a number of pastries, \nbelieving they contained cyanide. But unbeknownst to Yusupov, one of his co-conspirators \nhad a change of heart, and substituted the poison \nwith a harmless substance. To Yusupov’s shock, \nRasputin ate them without ill effect. In desperation, \nhe shot Rasputin at point-blank range. But Rasputin recovered, \npunched his attacker, and fled. Yusupov and his accomplices pursued him, finally killing Rasputin \nwith a bullet to the forehead and dumping his body \nin the Malaya Nevka river. But far from stabilizing \nthe monarchy’s authority, Rasputin’s death enraged the peasantry. Just as Rasputin prophesied, his murder was swiftly followed \nby that of the royal family. Whether the downfall \nof the Russian monarchy was a product of the monk’s curse, or the result of political tensions \ndecades in the making, well, we may never know. "

        "text": "Asgard, a realm of wonders, was where \nthe Norse Gods made their home. There Odin’s great hall of Valhalla \ntowered above the mountains and Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, \nanchored itself. But though their domain was magnificent, it stood undefended from the giants \nand trolls of Jotunheim, who despised the gods and \nsought to destroy them. One day when Thor, strongest of the \ngods, was off fighting these foes, a stranger appeared, \nriding a powerful gray horse. The visitor made the gods \nan astonishing offer. He would build them the greatest \nwall they’d ever seen, higher than any giant could climb \nand stronger than any troll could break. All he asked in return was the beautiful \ngoddess Freya’s hand in marriage— along with the sun and moon from the sky. The gods balked at this request \nand were ready to send him away. But the trickster Loki \nconcocted a devious plan. He told the gods they should \naccept the stranger’s offer, but set such strict conditions that he \nwould fail to complete the wall in time. That way, they would lose nothing, while \ngetting most of the wall built for free. Freya didn’t like this idea at all, but Odin and the other \ngods were convinced and came to an agreement \nwith the builder. He would only have one winter \nto complete the wall. If any part was unfinished by \nthe first day of summer, he would receive no payment. And he could have no help \nfrom any other people. The gods sealed the deal with solemn oaths and swore the mason would come \nto no harm in Asgard. In the morning, the stranger began to dig \nthe foundations at an astonishing speed, and at nightfall he set off towards the \nmountains to obtain the building stones. But it was only the next morning, \nwhen they saw him returning, that the gods began to worry. As agreed, no other people \nwere helping the mason. But his horse Svadilfari was hauling \na load of stones so massive it left trenches in the ground \nbehind them. Winter came and went. The stranger kept building, \nSvadilfari kept hauling, and neither snow nor rain could \nslow their progress. With only three days left until summer, \nthe wall stood high and impenetrable, with only the gate left to be built. Horrified, the gods realized that not \nonly would they lose their fertility goddess forever, but without the sun and moon the world \nwould be plunged into eternal darkness. They wondered why they’d made \nsuch a foolish wager— and then remembered Loki \nand his terrible advice. Suddenly, Loki didn’t feel so clever. All of his fellow gods threatened him \nwith an unimaginably painful death if he didn’t find some way to prevent \nthe builder from getting his payment. So Loki promised to take care of the \nsituation, and dashed away. Outside, night had fallen, and the builder prepared to set off \nto retrieve the final load of stones. But just as he called Svadilfari to him, \na mare appeared in the field. She was so beautiful that \nSvadilfari ignored his master and broke free of his reins. The mason tried to catch him, but the mare ran deep into the \nwoods and Svadilfari followed. The stranger was furious. He knew that the gods were behind \nthis and confronted them: no longer as a mild-mannered mason, but in his true form as a terrifying \nmountain giant. This was a big mistake. Thor had just returned to Asgard, and now that the gods knew \na giant was in their midst, they disregarded their oaths. The only payment the \nbuilder would receive— and the last thing he would ever see— was the swing of Thor’s \nmighty hammer Mjolnir. As they set the final stones into the \nwall, the gods celebrated their victory. Loki was not among them, however. Several months would pass \nbefore he finally returned, followed by a beautiful gray \nfoal with eight legs. The foal would grow into a magnificent \nsteed named Sleipnir and become Odin’s mount, a horse \nthat could outrun the wind itself. But exactly where he had come from was \nsomething Loki preferred not to discuss. "

It’s also unstoppable: weapons, fire, extreme temperatures… no matter what you throw at it, it just regrows and continues its rampage. Its expansion is breathtaking; it doubles in size every hour. But there’s one opportunity: after each hour, it goes to sleep, forming itself into a flat triangle and resting for a few minutes before it begins eating and growing again. Your only chance to save the planet involves a satellite-mounted nano-fission\nray that can cut through the blob. When the blog is active it heals itself within seconds. However, when you break the sleeping \nblob into two triangles, you make a critical discovery. The acute triangle portion, with all angles less than 90 degrees, \nis inert. It never “wakes up.” The obtuse triangle, which has an angle greater \nthan 90 degrees, wakes up as usual and keeps growing. Similar experiments show that all shapes \nother than acute triangles, including right triangles, \nwill also wake up. For the next few minutes, the blob is sleeping in its \nobtuse triangle form. You can make clean, straight-line cuts between any two points \non or inside the triangle. But you’ll only have time to make \n7 cuts while the satellite is above you. By the time it completes \nits orbit and returns, the blob will have consumed \nthe entire world, if even a single portion that \nwill wake up remains. How can you cut the blob entirely \ninto acute triangles and stop it from destroying the planet? Pause the video now \nto figure out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 While this seems doable at first, there’s a hidden difficulty when it comes\nto avoiding obtuse and right angles. Every time you make a cut that \nreaches an edge, it either makes an acute and \nan obtuse angle, or two right angles. That makes it seems like you’re doomed\nto keep creating obtuse angles. But as with so many of life’s problems, we can look to pizza for inspiration. Imagine squaring off the \noutside of a pizza, so that instead of a circle, \nit’s an octagon. When we cut it into slices, each of the eight triangles is acute. This works with larger polygons too. Importantly, it also works for some \npolygons with fewer sides, including heptagons, hexagons, \nand pentagons. That’s good news, because if you cut off the sharp corners \nof the blob triangle, a pentagon is exactly what \nyou’ll be left with. And just like a pizza, you can cut the blob pentagon \ninto five acute triangles. That’s 7 cuts, and it renders the \nblob completely inert. You’ve saved the day! Now you just need to figure out what to do with all of these giant, practically \nindestructible triangles. "

        "text": "Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons – there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, the earliest Neolithic farmers \nliving in the Fertile Crescent began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization itself. The rise of agriculture led to \ndomesticated sheep and goats, which ancient farmers harvested for milk. But when left in warm conditions \nfor several hours, that fresh milk began to sour. Its lactic acids caused proteins to \ncoagulate, binding into soft clumps. Upon discovering this \nstrange transformation, the farmers drained the remaining liquid – later named whey – and found the yellowish globs could be \neaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal. These clumps, or curds, became \nthe building blocks of cheese, which would eventually be aged, pressed, \nripened, and whizzed into a diverse cornucopia \nof dairy delights. The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic\npeople an enormous survival advantage. Milk was rich with essential proteins, \nfats, and minerals. But it also contained high \nquantities of lactose – a sugar which is difficult to process for \nmany ancient and modern stomachs. Cheese, however, could provide all of \nmilk’s advantages with much less lactose. And since it could be preserved \nand stockpiled, these essential nutrients could be eaten throughout scarce famines \nand long winters. Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments \nfound in Turkey still contain telltale residues of \nthe cheese and butter they held. By the end of the Bronze Age, cheese was a standard commodity \nin maritime trade throughout the eastern Mediterranean. In the densely populated city-states of \nMesopotamia, cheese became a staple \nof culinary and religious life. Some of the earliest known writing includes administrative records \nof cheese quotas, listing a variety of cheeses for different\nrituals and populations across Mesopotamia. Records from nearby civilizations \nin Turkey also reference rennet. This animal byproduct, produced in the\nstomachs of certain mammals, can accelerate and control coagulation. Eventually this sophisticated cheesemaking\ntool spread around the globe, giving way to a wide variety of new, \nharder cheeses. And though some conservative food \ncultures rejected the dairy delicacy, many more embraced cheese, and quickly\nadded their own local flavors. Nomadic Mongolians used yaks’ milk to\ncreate hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag. Egyptians enjoyed goats’ milk cottage \ncheese, straining the whey with reed mats. In South Asia, milk was coagulated with a\nvariety of food acids, such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt and then hung to dry into loafs of paneer. This soft mild cheese could be added to \ncurries and sauces, or simply fried as a \nquick vegetarian dish. The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined\nfeta cheese, alongside a harder variety similar to \ntoday’s pecorino romano. This grating cheese was produced in Sicily and used in dishes all across the \nMediterranean. Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” \nor “caseus aridus,” became an essential ration for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding\nthe vast borders of the Roman Empire. And when the Western Roman \nEmpire collapsed, cheesemaking continued to evolve in the manors that dotted the medieval\nEuropean countryside. In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteries\nscattered across Europe, medieval monks experimented endlessly \nwith different types of milk, cheesemaking practices, and aging processes that led to many \nof today’s popular cheeses. Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster \nand several Swiss types were all refined and perfected \nby these cheesemaking clergymen. In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was\nparticularly successful – producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses. By the end of the 14th century, Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of\nSwitzerland had become so profitable that a neighboring state invaded the \nGruyere highlands to take control of the growing \ncheese trade. Cheese remained popular through \nthe Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution took \nproduction out of the monastery and into machinery. Today, the world produces roughly \n22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. But 10,000 years after its invention, local farms are still following in the \nfootsteps of their Neolithic ancestors, hand crafting one of humanity’s \noldest and favorite foods. "

        "text": "“It was a pleasure to burn. It was a special pleasure\nto see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed.” Fahrenheit 451 opens in a blissful blaze\n- and before long, we learn what’s going up in flames. Ray Bradbury’s novel imagines a world where books are banned \nfrom all areas of life - and possessing, let alone \nreading them, is forbidden. The protagonist, Montag, is a fireman\nresponsible for destroying what remains. But as his pleasure gives way to doubt, the story raises critical questions\nof how to preserve one’s mind in a society where free will, self-expression,\nand curiosity are under fire. In Montag’s world, mass media\nhas a monopoly on information, erasing almost all ability\nfor independent thought. On the subway, ads blast out of the walls. At home, Montag’s wife Mildred listens to\nthe radio around the clock, and three of their parlor walls\nare plastered with screens. At work, the smell of kerosene\nhangs over Montag’s colleagues,  who smoke and set their mechanical\nhound after rats to pass the time. When the alarm sounds they surge\nout in salamander-shaped vehicles, sometimes to burn whole\nlibraries to the ground. But as he sets tomes ablaze day\nafter day like “black butterflies,” Montag’s mind occasionally wanders to the\ncontraband that lies hidden in his home. Gradually, he begins to question\nthe basis of his work. Montag realizes he’s always felt uneasy - but has lacked the descriptive words\nto express his feelings in a society where even uttering the phrase\n“once upon a time” can be fatal. Fahrenheit 451 depicts a world governed by surveillance, robotics, \nand virtual reality- a vision that proved remarkably prescient,\nbut also spoke to the concerns of the time. The novel was published in 1953,\nat the height of the Cold War. This era kindled widespread \nparanoia and fear throughout Bradbury’s home \ncountry of the United States, amplified by the suppression of information\nand brutal government investigations. In particular, this witch hunt mentality targeted artists and writers who\nwere suspected of Communist sympathies. Bradbury was alarmed at\nthis cultural crackdown. He believed it set a dangerous \nprecedent for further censorship, and was reminded of the destruction of\nthe Library of Alexandria and the book-burning of Fascist regimes. He explored these chilling \nconnections in Fahrenheit 451, titled after the temperature \nat which paper burns. The accuracy of that temperature\nhas been called into question, but that doesn’t diminish the novel’s \nstanding as a masterpiece of dystopian fiction. Dystopian fiction as a genre amplifies\ntroubling features of the world around us and imagines the consequences\nof taking them to an extreme. In many dystopian stories,  the government imposes constrictions\nonto unwilling subjects. But in Fahrenheit 451, Montag learns that it was\nthe apathy of the masses that gave rise to the current regime. The government merely capitalized on\nshort attention spans and the appetite for \nmindless entertainment, reducing the circulation of ideas to ash. As culture disappears,\nimagination and self-expression follow. Even the way people talk\nis short-circuited - such as when Montag’s boss Captain Beatty\ndescribes the acceleration of mass culture: \"Speed up the film, Montag, quick.\nClick? Pic? Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out,\nWhy, How, Who, What, Where, Eh? Uh! Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom!\nDigest-digests, digest-digest-digests. Politics? One column, two sentences, a\nheadline! Then, in mid-air, all vanishes!\" In this barren world, Montag learns\nhow difficult it is to resist when there's nothing left to hold on to. Altogether, Fahrenheit 451 is a portrait\nof independent thought on the brink of extinction - and a parable about a\nsociety which is complicit in its own combustion. "

Though different areas of the skin\nhave different characteristics, much of this surface performs\nsimilar functions, such as sweating, feeling heat and cold,\nand growing hair. But after a deep cut or wound, the newly healed skin will look different\nfrom the surrounding area, and may not fully regain all \nits abilities for a while, or at all. To understand why this happens, we need to\nlook at the structure of the human skin. The top layer, called the epidermis, consists mostly of hardened cells,\ncalled keratinocytes, and provides protection. Since its outer layer is constantly being\nshed and renewed, it's pretty easy to repair. But sometimes a wound penetrates\ninto the dermis, which contains blood vessels\nand the various glands and nerve endings that enable the skin's many functions. And when that happens, it triggers the\nfour overlapping stages of the regenerative process. The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's\nresponse to two immediate threats: that you're now losing blood and that the physical barrier of \nthe epidermis has been compromised. As the blood vessels tighten to minimize\nthe bleeding, in a process known as \nvasoconstriction, both threats are averted by forming\na blood clot. A special protein known as fibrin forms\ncross-links on the top of the skin, preventing blood from flowing out\nand bacteria or pathogens from getting in. After about three hours of this,\nthe skin begins to turn red, signaling the next stage, inflammation. With bleeding under control\nand the barrier secured, the body sends special cells to fight any\npathogens that may have gotten through. Among the most important of these\nare white blood cells, known as macrophages, which devour bacteria and damage tissue\nthrough a process known as phagocytosis, in addition to producing growth factors\nto spur healing. And because these tiny soldiers \nneed to travel through the blood to \nget to the wound site, the previously constricted \nblood vessels now expand in a process called vasodilation. About two to three days after the wound, the proliferative stage occurs, when \nfibroblast cells begin to enter the wound. In the process of collagen deposition, they produce a fibrous protein \ncalled collagen in the wound site, forming connective skin tissue\nto replace the fibrin from before. As epidermal cells divide to reform\nthe outer layer of skin, the dermis contracts to close the wound. Finally, in the fourth stage \nof remodeling, the wound matures as the newly deposited\ncollagen is rearranged and converted into specific types. Through this process,\nwhich can take over a year, the tensile strength of the new skin\nis improved, and blood vessels and other connections\nare strengthened. With time, the new tissue \ncan reach from 50-80% of some of its original healthy function, depending on the severity of the initial \nwound and on the function itself. But because the skin\ndoes not fully recover, scarring continues to be a major clinical\nissue for doctors around the world. And even though researchers have made\nsignificant strides in understanding the healing process, many fundamental mysteries\nremain unresolved. For instance, do fibroblast cells arrive\nfrom the blood vessels or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound? And why do some other mammals, \nsuch as deer, heal their wounds much more efficiently\nand completely than humans? By finding the answers to these questions\nand others, we may one day be able to heal ourselves\nso well that scars will be just a memory. "

        "text": "During World War I, one of the \nhorrors of trench warfare was a poisonous yellow cloud \ncalled mustard gas. For those unlucky enough to be exposed, it made the air impossible to breathe, \nburned their eyes, and caused huge blisters on exposed skin. Scientists tried desperately to develop an\nantidote to this vicious weapon of war. In the process they discovered the gas \nwas irrevocably damaging the bone marrow of affected soldiers— halting its \nability to make blood cells. Despite these awful effects, \nit gave scientists an idea. Cancer cells share a characteristic with \nbone marrow: both replicate rapidly. So could one of the atrocities of war become a champion in the \nfight against cancer? Researchers in the 1930s \ninvestigated this idea by injecting compounds derived \nfrom mustard gas into the veins of cancer patients. It took time and trial and error to find \ntreatments that did more good than harm, but by the end of World War II, they discovered what became known \nas the first chemotherapy drugs. Today, there are more than 100. Chemotherapy drugs are delivered \nthrough pills and injections and use \"cytotoxic agents,\" which means \ncompounds that are toxic to living cells. Essentially, these medicines cause some \nlevel of harm to all cells in the body— even healthy ones. But they reserve their most powerful \neffects for rapidly-dividing cells, which is precisely the hallmark of cancer. Take, for example, those first \nchemotherapy drugs, which are still used today and \nare called alkylating agents. They’re injected into the bloodstream, which delivers them to \ncells all over the body. Once inside, when the cell exposes \nits DNA in order to copy it, they damage the building blocks of \nDNA’s double helix structure, which can lead to cell death unless \nthe damage is repaired. Because cancer cells multiply rapidly, they take in a high concentration \nof alkylating agents, and their DNA is frequently exposed \nand rarely repaired. So they die off more often \nthan most other cells, which have time to fix damaged DNA and don’t accumulate the same \nconcentrations of alkylating agents. Another form of chemotherapy involves \ncompounds called microtubule stabilizers. Cells have small tubes that assemble \nto help with cell division and DNA replication, then break back down. When microtubule stabilizers \nget inside a cell, they keep those tiny tubes \nfrom disassembling. That prevents the cell from completing \nits replication, leading to its death. These are just two examples of the six \nclasses of chemotherapy drugs we use to treat cancer today. But despite its huge benefits, \nchemotherapy has one big disadvantage: it affects other healthy cells in the body\nthat naturally have to renew rapidly. Hair follicles, the cells of the mouth, \nthe gastrointestinal lining, the reproductive system, and bone marrow \nare hit nearly as hard as cancer. Similar to cancer cells, the rapid \nproduction of these normal cells means that they’re reaching for \nresources more frequently— and are therefore more exposed to \nthe effects of chemo drugs. That leads to several common side \neffects of chemotherapy, including hair loss, fatigue, infertility,\nnausea, and vomiting. Doctors commonly prescribe options \nto help manage these side-effects, such as strong anti-nausea medications. For hair loss, devices called cold caps \ncan help lower the temperature around the head and \nconstrict blood vessels, limiting the amount of chemotherapy \ndrugs that reach hair follicles. And once a course of chemo \ntreatment is over, the healthy tissues that’ve been badly \naffected by the drug will recover and begin to renew as usual. In 2018 alone, over 17 million people \nworld-wide received a cancer diagnosis. But chemotherapy and other treatments \nhave changed the outlook for so many. Just take the fact that up to 95% of \nindividuals with testicular cancer survive it, thanks to advances \nin treatment. Even in people with acute myeloid \nleukemia— an aggressive blood cancer— chemotherapy puts an estimated \n60% of patients under 60 into remission following their \nfirst phase of treatment. Researchers are still developing \nmore precise interventions that only target the intended \ncancer cells. That’ll help improve survival rates \nwhile leaving healthy tissues with reduced harm, making one of the best tools we have \nin the fight against cancer even better. "

        "text": "The oldest glue in the world \nis over 8,000 years old and comes from a cave near the Dead Sea. Ancient people used this glue, made from a mixture of animal bone \nand plant materials, to waterproof baskets \nand construct utensils. And for thousands of years after, plants and animals were the glue \nthat held human civilization together. Today, we have enough types of tape and\nglue to build and repair almost anything. But what gives glue \nand tape their stickiness? And is one stronger than the other? Adhesives can be made \nfrom synthetic molecules or natural proteins and carbohydrates like the vegetable starch dextrin, the milk protein casein, and the terpenes in tree resin. In order to work, glue and tape need \nboth adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds. Adhesive bonds occur between \nan adhesive’s molecules and the molecules \nof whatever it’s sticking to. Cohesive bonds happen between \na glue or tape’s own molecules, holding it together. Most glues consist of adhesive polymers \ndissolved in a solvent that prevents them from sticking\nto the inside of the bottle. The strong smell of many glues \ncomes from the solvent, which evaporates when exposed to air. Some glues use water as a solvent, but others use chemicals \nthat can be harmful to inhale. Glues with two or more components that\nchemically react instead of just drying can create stronger bonds. Both the adhesive and cohesive bonds \nof glue are strong, but the drying process \nmakes them irreversible. This is why, if a glued surface \nis broken after it dries, it can’t be reattached without new glue. By contrast, \nwhen tape is applied to a surface, it forms weaker, reversible bonds, so you can peel a piece of tape off \na surface and use it again. These weak bonds, \ncalled Van der Waals forces, can occur between any two materials, but only if they’re \nextremely close together, closer than the naked eye can see. Tape usually consists of a backing coated \nwith a combination of a rubber or rubber-like \"stretchy\" component, and a compound called a tackifier. That’s the \"sticky\" component. A tape’s stickiness is determined by the proportion of elastic component \nand tackifier, the thickness of adhesive spread \nonto the backing, and the type of backing material. No chemical reaction occurs \nwhen tape is pressed onto a surface. Instead, the soft adhesive flows into \nthe cracks and grooves of the surface. This ability to slide into cracks and then\nstay in place is called viscoelasticity. Once the viscoelastic adhesive fills \nthese microscopic crevices, it is close enough to form \nVan der Waals forces. So what’s the world’s strongest adhesive? Well, there’s no one answer. In terms of absolute strength \nof adhesive bonds, glue is stronger than tape, but no single adhesive\nworks well in all circumstances. Of the glues, cyanoacrylates, \nor super glues, may form the strongest bonds, but two-component epoxy glues have much\nhigher resistance to heat and shearing, and are compatible \nwith a wider range of surfaces. So, if you wanted \nto dangle an anvil in the air, super glue might be your best bet. But if you’re doing so \nover an active volcano, you’d want an epoxy instead. And in order to work at all, glues need enough real estate \nwhere surfaces touch. If for some reason you wanted \nto make a chain of bowling balls, duct tape would be better. Engineers weigh similar, \nif less absurd, factors all the time. Choosing the right glue to withstand \nthe heat inside an engine is a matter of life and death. And though the strength \nof duct tape’s adhesive bonds can’t compete with those of epoxy glues, tape does have the advantage of \ninstantaneous stickiness in an emergency. Glue may be necessary \nto get a rocket to space, but when it comes \nto extraterrestrial repairs, stick to duct tape: \nliquid glues don’t work in zero gravity. "

        "text": "In medieval times, alchemists tried to achieve \nthe seemingly impossible. They wanted to transform lowly lead\ninto gleaming gold. History portrays these people\nas aged eccentrics, but if only they'd known that their\ndreams were actually achievable. Indeed, today we can \nmanufacture gold on Earth thanks to modern inventions that those medieval alchemists\nmissed by a few centuries. But to understand how this precious metal became embedded \nin our planet to start with, we have to gaze upwards at the stars. Gold is extraterrestrial. Instead of arising \nfrom the planet's rocky crust, it was actually cooked up in space and is present on Earth \nbecause of cataclysmic stellar explosions called supernovae. Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen,\nthe simplest and lightest element. The enormous gravitational pressure\nof so much material compresses and triggers nuclear fusion\nin the star's core. This process releases energy\nfrom the hydrogen, making the star shine. Over many millions of years, fusion transforms hydrogen \ninto heavier elements: helium, carbon, and oxygen, burning subsequent elements faster\nand faster to reach iron and nickel. However, at that point nuclear fusion\nno longer releases enough energy, and the pressure from the core peters out. The outer layers collapse into the center, and bouncing back from this sudden\ninjection of energy, the star explodes forming a supernova. The extreme pressure\nof a collapsing star is so high, that subatomic protons and electrons\nare forced together in the core, forming neutrons. Neutrons have no repelling electric charge so they're easily captured \nby the iron group elements. Multiple neutron captures enable\nthe formation of heavier elements that a star under \nnormal circumstances can't form, from silver to gold, past lead and on to uranium. In extreme contrast to the million year\ntransformation of hydrogen to helium, the creation of the heaviest \nelements in a supernova takes place in only seconds. But what becomes of the gold\nafter the explosion? The expanding supernova shockwave\npropels its elemental debris through the interstellar medium, triggering a swirling dance \nof gas and dust that condenses into new stars and planets. Earth's gold was likely delivered this way before being kneaded into veins\nby geothermal activity. Billions of years later, we now extract\nthis precious product by mining it, an expensive process that's compounded\nby gold's rarity. In fact, all of the gold \nthat we've mined in history could be piled into \njust three Olympic-size swimming pools, although this represents a lot of mass because gold is about 20 times \ndenser than water. So, can we produce more \nof this coveted commodity? Actually, yes. Using particle accelerators, we can mimic\nthe complex nuclear reactions that create gold in stars. But these machines can only construct gold\natom by atom. So it would take almost the age \nof the universe to produce one gram at a cost vastly exceeding \nthe current value of gold. So that's not a very good solution. But if we were to reach \na hypothetical point where we'd mined \nall of the Earth's buried gold, there are other places we could look. The ocean holds an estimated \n20 million tons of dissolved gold but at extremely miniscule concentrations\nmaking its recovery too costly at present. Perhaps one day, we'll see gold rushes\nto tap the mineral wealth of the other planets of our solar system. And who knows? Maybe some future supernova \nwill occur close enough to shower us with its treasure and hopefully not eradicate \nall life on Earth in the process. "

        "text": "What drives someone to kill in cold blood? What goes through the murderer’s mind? And what kind of a society \nbreeds such people? Over 150 years ago Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky \ntook these questions up in what would become one of the \nbest-known works of Russian literature: \"Crime and Punishment.\" First serialized in a literary \nmagazine in 1866, the novel tells the story of Rodion \nRomanovich Raskolnikov, a young law student in Saint Petersburg. Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty, and at the start of the story has run \nout of funds to continue his studies. Letters from his rural home \nonly add to his distress when he realizes how much his mother and \nsister have sacrificed for his success. Increasingly desperate after selling the last of his valuables\nto an elderly pawnbroker, he resolves on a plan \nto murder and rob her. But the impact of carrying out \nthis unthinkable act proves to be more than \nhe was prepared for. Though the novel is sometimes cited as one\nof the first psychological thrillers, its scope reaches far beyond \nRaskolnikov’s inner turmoil. From dank taverns to dilapidated \napartments and claustrophobic police stations, the underbelly of 19th century Saint \nPetersburg is brought to life by Dostoyevsky’s searing prose. We’re introduced to characters \nsuch as Marmeladov, a miserable former official who \nhas drank his family into ruin, and Svidrigailov, an unhinged \nand lecherous nobleman. As Raskolnikov’s own family \narrives in town, their moral innocence stands \nin stark contrast to the depravity of those around them, even as their fates grow \nincreasingly intertwined. This bleak portrait of Russian society reflects the author’s own complex life \nexperiences and evolving ideas. As a young writer who left behind \na promising military career, Fyodor had been attracted to \nideas of socialism and reform, and joined a circle of intellectuals to \ndiscuss radical texts banned by the Imperial government. Upon exposure, members of this group, including \nDostoyevsky, were arrested. Many were sentenced to death, only to be subjected to a mock execution \nand last-minute pardon from the Tsar. Dostoyevsky spent the next four \nyears in a Siberian labor camp before being released in 1854. The experience left him with a far \nmore pessimistic view of social reform, and his focus shifted toward \nspiritual concerns. In the 1864 novella \"Notes from \nUnderground,\" he expounded on his belief that utopian\nWestern philosophies could never satisfy the contradictory \nyearnings of the human soul. \"Crime and Punishment\" was conceived \nand completed the following year, picking up on many of the same themes. In many ways, the novel follows a common \nnarrative thread where a promising youth is seduced and\ncorrupted by the dangers of urban life. But its social critique cuts far deeper. Raskolnikov rationalizes that \nhis own advancement at the cost of the exploitative \npawnbroker’s death would be a net benefit to society. In doing so, he echoes the doctrines of egoism \nand utilitarianism embraced by many of Dostoyevsky’s \ncontemporary intellectuals. And in believing that his intelligence \nallows him to transcend moral taboos, Raskolnikov cuts himself off from \nhis own humanity. Yet although the book is deeply \nconcerned with morality, \"Crime and Punishment\" never comes across\nas merely moralizing, with each character given their own \ndistinctive and convincing voice. One of the most remarkable things about\n\"Crime and Punishment\" is its ability to thrill despite the details of the central murder \nbeing revealed in the first act. Raskolnikov’s crime is clear. But it’s only through Dostoyevsky’s \ngripping account of the ensuing social and \npsychological turmoil that we learn the true nature \nof his punishment– and the possibility of redemption. "

        "text": "On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship\nBismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her \n2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to\ncollect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white\ncat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat\nhunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered\nthe hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before\nretiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable\nsailors, or cooperative companions \nof any kind. But cats have been working alongside\nhumans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go \nfrom wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than\n10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature\nto their will, producing much more food than\nfarmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess\ngrain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted\nhordes of rodents, as well as their predator,\nFelis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa\nand Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,\ncarnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size\nand appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient\nwildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social\ntowards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested \ngranaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the \npresence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated\nthe cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that\nthe cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe\nand the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major\nscourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and\ngnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become\nessential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian\nglobe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated \ntheir own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch\nvenomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important\nto Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,\nhieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate\nfrom port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,\nships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the\ncentral Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, \nEgyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern \nand North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- \ncontinued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for\nAustralia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern\nor the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica.

And apart from making them\nmore social and docile, we’ve done little to alter\ntheir natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or\nless as they’ve always been: Wild animals.

        "text": "In 1996, a British Airways plane\nflew from New York to London in a record-breaking \ntwo hours and 53 minutes. Today, however, passengers flying \nthe same route can expect to spend no less than six hours\nin the air— twice as long. So why, in a world where everything \nseems to be getting faster, have commercial flights lagged behind? The British-and-French-made Concorde\nbegan shuttling passengers across the sky in the 1970s. Jetting between destinations like \nNew York, Paris, Bahrain, and Singapore, it clocked in at over 2,000 kilometers \nper hour, more than twice the speed\nof a normal airliner. However this was also about 800 kilometers\nper hour faster than the speed of sound. And that created a surprising problem \nfor people on the ground. When an object moves at supersonic speed, it generates a continuous moving shockwave\nknown as a sonic boom. This produces a loud, startling noise, as well as rattling windows and dislodging\nstructural elements of buildings. Since a plane flying at an altitude \nof 15 kilometers can affect an area with an 80 kilometer\ndiameter on the ground below, complaints and concerns from residents \nin the Concorde’s flight path restricted it to mostly ocean routes. Because of these restrictions and other\nfuel and engineering requirements, supersonic flights turned out \nto be very expensive for both airlines and passengers. A single transatlantic\nround-trip could cost the equivalent of more than $10,000 today. With additional strain \non the airline industry due to decreased demand for flights\nafter September 11th, 2001, this became unsustainable, \nand the Concorde was retired in 2003. So even when superfast flights existed,\nthey weren't standard commercial flights. And while we might think that advances \nin flight technology would make fast flights less expensive, \nthis hasn’t necessarily been the case. One of the biggest concerns \nis fuel economy. Over the decades, jet engines have become\na lot more efficient, taking in more air \nand achieving more thrust— traveling further for every\nliter of fuel. But this efficiency is only achieved \nat speeds of up to around 900 kilometers per hour—\nless than half the speed of the Concorde. Going any faster would increase air intake\nand burn more fuel per kilometer flown. A standard transatlantic flight still uses\nas much as 150,000 liters of fuel, amounting to over 20% \nof an airline’s total expenses. So any reduction in fuel economy \nand increase in speed would significantly increase both \nflight costs and environmental impact. What about ways to make a plane faster \nwithout burning lots of fuel? Adjusting the wing sweep, or the angle\nat which wings protrude from the fuselage, to bring the wings closer in can \nmake an aircraft faster by reducing aerodynamic drag. But this means the wings must be longer\nto achieve the same wingspan, and that means more materials\nand more weight, which in turn means burning more fuel. So while airplanes could be designed\nto be more aerodynamic, this would make them more expensive. And generally, airlines have found \nthat customer demand for faster flights is not sufficient to cover these costs. So while military aircraft conduct \nhigh speed flights over water and at high altitudes, supersonic commercial flights seemed\nlike a brief and failed experiment. But recent advances\nmay make them feasible again. Research by NASA and DARPA has shown \nthat modifying an aircraft’s shape can reduce the impact \nof its sonic boom by 1/3. Extending the nose with a long spike can\nbreak the shockwave into smaller ones, while another proposed design features \ntwo sets of wings producing waves \nthat cancel each other out. And new technologies may solve \nthe energy efficiency problem with alternative and synthetic fuels,\nor even hybrid-electric planes. It may yet turn out that the last \nfew decades of steady flying were just a brief rest stop. "

        "text": "After months of travel, \nyou’ve arrived at Duonia, home to the famous temple that’s \nthe destination of your pilgrimage. Entering from the northwest, you pass through the city gates \nand the welcome center, where you’re given a map and a brochure. The map reveals that the town consists\nof 16 blocks, formed by five streets that \nrun west to east, intersecting five more \nthat run north to south. You’re standing on the\nnorthernmost street facing east, with the two blocks containing the gate \nand the welcome center behind you. The temple’s only entrance lies \nat the very southeast corner. It’s not a long walk, \nbut there’s a problem. As you learn from the brochure, Duonia imposes a unique tax \non all visitors, which must be paid when they arrive \nat their destination within the city. The tax begins at zero, increases by two silver \nfor every block you walk east, and doubles for every block \nyou walk south. However, a recent reform \nto make the tax fairer halves your total bill for\nevery block you walk north and subtracts two silver \nfor every block you walk west. Just passing through the gate \nand the welcome center means you already owe four silver. As a pilgrim you carry no money \nand have no way of earning any. What’s more, the rules \nof your pilgrimage forbid you from walking over any stretch of\nground more than once during your journey— though you can cross your own path. Can you figure out a way to reach \nthe temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice \nin any direction? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You look at the map \nto consider your options. Walking towards the temple \nalways increases the tax, and walking away decreases it, so it seems like you can never reach it\nwithout owing silver. But what happens when you walk \naround a single block? If you start out owing four silver\nand go clockwise starting east, your tax bill becomes six, then 12, then 10, then five. If you looped again, you’d owe seven, 14, 12, and six. It seems that each clockwise loop leaves \nyou owing one extra silver. What about a counterclockwise loop then? Starting owing four again \nand going south first, your bill changes to eight, 10, five, and three. Looping again you’d owe six, eight, four, and two. Each counterclockwise loop actually earns \nyou one silver. That’s because any tax doubled, plus two, halved, and minus two, always ends up one smaller \nthan it started. The key here is that while the different \ntaxes for opposite directions may seem to balance each other out, the order in which they’re applied \nmakes a huge difference. You start off owing four silver, so four counterclockwise loops would \nget you down to zero. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, \nsince you can’t walk the same block twice. But there’s another way\nto reduce your bill: walking one large counterclockwise loop\nthrough the city. From your starting position, \nwalk three blocks south. You need to leave the southernmost \nstreet clear for the final stretch, so continuing counterclockwise \nmeans going east. Walk two blocks to the eastern wall \nand you owe a whopping 36 silver. But now you can start reducing your bill. Three blocks north and one block west \ncuts it to 2.5. You can’t go west from here \n—that would leave you with no way out. So you go one block south, \nand the remaining three blocks west, leaving you with a debt \nof -1 silver. And since doubling a negative number \nstill gives you a negative number, walking the three blocks to the south wall\nmeans the city owes you eight. Fortunately, that’s exactly enough to get you through the final blocks \nto the temple. As you enter, you realize what \nyou’ve learned from your pilgrimage: sometimes an indirect route \nis the best way to reach your destination. "

        "text": "It's often said that despite \nhumanity's many conflicts, we all bleed the same blood. It's a nice thought\nbut not quite accurate. In fact, our blood comes \nin a few different varieties. Our red blood cells contain\na protein called hemoglobin that binds to oxygen, allowing the cells to transport it\nthroughout the body. But they also have another kind\nof complex protein on the outside of the cell membrane. These proteins, known as antigens,\ncommunicate with white blood cells, immune cells that protect \nagainst infection. Antigens serve as identifying markers, allowing the immune system to recognize\nyour body's own cells without attacking them as foreign bodies. The two main kinds of antigens, A and B,\ndetermine your blood type. But how do we get four blood types\nfrom only two antigens? Well, the antigens are coded for\nby three different alleles, varieties of a particular gene. While the A and B alleles code\nfor A and B antigens, the O allele codes for neither, and because we inherit \none copy of each gene from each parent, every individual has two alleles\ndetermining blood type. When these happen to be different, one overrides the other \ndepending on their relative dominance. For blood types, the A and B alleles\nare both dominant, while O is recessive. So A and A gives you type A blood,\nwhile B and B gives you type B. If you inherit one of each, the resulting codominance\nwill produce both A and B antigens, which is type AB. The O allele is recessive, so either of the others will override it\nwhen they're paired, resulting in either type A or type B. But if you happen to inherit two Os,\ninstructions will be expressed that make blood cells \nwithout the A or the B antigen. Because of these interactions, knowing both parents' blood types lets us predict the relative probability \nof their children's blood types. Why do blood types matter? For blood transfusions, finding the correct one is a matter\nof life and death. If someone with type A blood\nis given type B blood, or vice versa, their antibodies will reject \nthe foreign antigens and attack them, potentially causing \nthe transfused blood to clot. But because people with type AB blood\nproduce both A and B antigens, they don't make antibodies against them,\nso they will recognize either as safe, making them universal recipients. On the other hand, people with blood type O\ndo not produce either antigen, which makes them universal donors, but will cause their immune system\nto make antibodies that reject any other blood type. Unfortunately, matching donors \nand recipients is a bit more complicated due to additional antigen systems, particular the Rh factor, named after the Rhesus monkeys\nin which it was first isolated. Rh+ or Rh- refers to the presence\nor absence of the D antigen of the Rh blood group system. And in addition to impeding \nsome blood transfusions, it can cause severe complications\nin pregnancy. If an Rh- mother is carrying an Rh+ child, her body will produce Rh antibodies\nthat may cross the placenta and attack the fetus, a condition known as \nhemolytic disease of the newborn. Some cultures believe blood type\nto be associated with personality, though this is not \nsupported by science. And though the proportions\nof different blood types vary between human populations, scientists aren't sure why they evolved; perhaps as protection \nagainst blood born diseases, or due to random genetic drift. Finally, different species \nhave different sets of antigens. In fact, the four main blood types\nshared by us apes seem paltry in comparison \nto the thirteen types found in dogs. "

        "text": "Schizophrenia was first identified \nmore than a century ago, but we still don’t know its exact causes. It remains one of the most misunderstood \nand stigmatized illnesses today. So, let’s walk through what we do know— \nfrom symptoms to causes and treatments. Schizophrenia is considered a syndrome, which means it may encompass \na number of related disorders that have similar symptoms \nbut varying causes. Every person with schizophrenia \nhas slightly different symptoms, and the first signs can be easy to miss— \nsubtle personality changes, irritability, or a gradual encroachment \nof unusual thoughts. Patients are usually diagnosed \nafter the onset of psychosis, which typically occurs in the late teens \nor early twenties for men and the late twenties \nor early thirties for women. A first psychotic episode can feature \ndelusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and behavior. These are called positive symptoms, meaning they occur \nin people with schizophrenia but not in the general population. It’s a common misperception \nthat people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, but these symptoms indicate a disruption \nof thought processes, rather than the manifestation \nof another personality. Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms, these are qualities that are reduced \nin people with schizophrenia, such as motivation, \nexpression of emotion, or speech. There are cognitive symptoms as well, \nlike difficulty concentrating, remembering information, \nand making decisions. So what causes the onset of psychosis? There likely isn’t one single cause,\nbut a combination of genetic and environmental \nrisk factors that contribute. Schizophrenia has some of the strongest \ngenetic links of any psychiatric illness. Though about 1% of people \nhave schizophrenia, children or siblings of people \nwith schizophrenia are ten times likelier to develop the disease, and an identical twin \nof someone with schizophrenia has a 40% chance of being affected. Often, immediate relatives \nof people with schizophrenia exhibit milder versions of traits \nassociated with the disorder— but not to an extent \nthat requires treatment. Multiple genes almost certainly \nplay a role, but we don’t know how many, or which ones. Environmental factors like exposure \nto certain viruses in early infancy might increase the chance \nthat someone will develop schizophrenia, and use of some drugs, \nincluding marijuana, may trigger the onset of psychosis in highly susceptible individuals. These factors don’t affect \neveryone the same way. For those with very low genetic risk, no amount of exposure \nto environmental risk factors will lead them to develop schizophrenia; for those with very high risk, moderate \nadditional risk might tip the balance. The antipsychotic drugs used to treat \nschizophrenia have helped researchers work backwards to trace signatures \nof the disorder in the brain. Traditional antipsychotics \nblock dopamine receptors. They can be very effective \nin reducing positive symptoms, which are linked to an excess of dopamine \nin particular brain pathways. But the same drugs \ncan make negative symptoms worse, and we’ve found that negative symptoms \nof schizophrenia may be tied to too little dopamine \nin other brain areas. Some people with schizophrenia \nshow a loss of neural tissue, and it’s unclear whether this atrophy \nis a result of the disease itself or drug-induced suppression of signaling. Fortunately, newer generations \nof antipsychotics aim to address some of these issues by targeting \nmultiple neurotransmitters, like serotonin in addition to dopamine. It’s clear that no one transmitter system \nis responsible for all symptoms, and because these drugs affect signaling \nthroughout the brain and body, they can have other \nside effects like weight gain. In spite of these complications, \nantipsychotics can be very effective, especially when combined \nwith other interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy, though \nit provides relatively short-lived relief, is also re-emerging \nas an effective treatment, especially when other options \nhave failed. Early intervention \nis also extremely important. After months or years \nof untreated psychosis, certain psychoses can become embedded \nin someone’s personality. And yet, the dehumanizing stigma \nattached to this diagnosis can prevent people from seeking help. People with schizophrenia \nare often perceived as dangerous, but are actually much more likely \nto be the victims of violence than the perpetrators. And proper treatment may help reduce \nthe likelihood of violence associated with schizophrenia. That’s why education— for patients, \ntheir families, and their communities— helps erode the stigma \nand improves access to treatment. "

        "text": "Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to the cells inside our own bodies. Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water. At birth, human babies are even wetter. Being 75% water, \nthey are swimmingly similar to fish. But their water composition drops to 65%\nby their first birthday. So what role does water \nplay in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink\nto stay healthy? The H20 in our bodies works to cushion\nand lubricate joints, regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord. Water isn't only in our blood. An adult's brain and heart are almost\nthree quarters water. That's roughly equivalent to the amount\nof moisture in a banana. Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%. And even seemingly dry human bones\nare 31% water. If we are essentially made of water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much? Well, each day we lose two to three liters\nthrough our sweat, urine, and bowel movements, and even just from breathing. While these functions \nare essential to our survival, we need to compensate for the fluid loss. Maintaining a balanced water level\nis essential to avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating\neffects on overall health. At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors \nin the brain's hypothalamus signal the release \nof antidiuretic hormone. When it reached the kidneys, \nit creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood\nto absorb and retain more water, leading to concentrated, dark urine. Increased dehydration can cause\nnotable drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment. A dehydrated brain works harder \nto accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it even temporarily shrinks\nbecause of its lack of water. Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption\nof water in a short amount of time. Athletes are often the victims \nof over-hydration because of complications \nin regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions. Whereas the dehydrated brain amps\nup the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows,\nor even stops, releasing it into the blood. Sodium electrolytes in the body\nbecome diluted, causing cells to swell. In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with \nthe resulting volumes of dilute urine. Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache, vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures\nor death. But that's a pretty extreme situation. On a normal, day-to-day basis, maintaining a well-hydrated system\nis easy to manage for those of us fortunate enough \nto have access to clean drinking water. For a long time, conventional wisdom said\nthat we should drink eight glasses a day. That estimate has since been fine-tuned. Now, the consensus is that the amount\nof water we need to imbibe depends largely on our weight\nand environment. The recommended daily intake varies from\nbetween 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up \nor down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating. While water is the healthiest hydrator, other beverages, even those with caffeine \nlike coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well. And water within food makes up \nabout a fifth of our daily H20 intake. Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement liquid intake while\nproviding valuable nutrients and fiber. Drinking well might also have various\nlong-term benefits. Studies have shown that optimal hydration\ncan lower the chance of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk\nof certain types of cancer. No matter what, getting the right amount\nof liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day. "

You were unconscious, but you also couldn't move, form memories, or, hopefully, feel pain.

Regional anesthesia blocks pain signals\nfrom a specific part of the body from getting to the brain. Pain and other messages travel through\nthe nervous system as electrical impulses. Regional anesthetics work by setting up\nan electrical barricade. They bind to the proteins \nin neurons' cell membranes that let charged particles in and out, and lock out positively charged particles. One compound that does this is cocaine, whose painkilling effects \nwere discovered by accident when an ophthalmology intern\ngot some on his tongue. It's still occasionally used \nas an anesthetic, but many of the more common\nregional anesthetics have a similar chemical structure\nand work the same way. But for major surgeries where you need\nto be unconscious, you'll want something that acts\non the entire nervous system, including the brain. That's what inhalational anesthetics do. In Western medicine, diethyl ether\nwas the first common one. It was best known as a recreational drug until doctors started to realize that\npeople sometimes didn't notice injuries they received \nunder the influence. In the 1840s, they started sedating\npatients with ether during dental extractions and surgeries. Nitrous oxide became popular\nin the decades that followed and is still used today. although ether derivatives, \nlike sevoflurane, are more common. Inhalational anesthesia is usually \nsupplemented with intravenous anesthesia, which was developed in the 1870s. Common intravenous agents include\nsedatives, like propofol, which induce unconsciousness, and opioids, like fentanyl, \nwhich reduce pain. These general anesthetics \nalso seem to work by affecting electrical signals\nin the nervous system. Normally, the brain's electrical signals\nare a chaotic chorus as different parts of the brain\ncommunicate with each other. That connectivity keeps you awake\nand aware. But as someone becomes anesthetized, those signals become calmer\nand more organized, suggesting that different \nparts of the brain aren't talking to each other anymore. There's a lot we still don't know\nabout exactly how this happens. Several common anesthetics bind to\nthe GABA-A receptor in the brain's neurons. They hold the gateway open, letting negatively charged particles\nflow into the cell. Negative charge builds up\nand acts like a log jam, keeping the neuron from transmitting\nelectrical signals. The nervous system has lots\nof these gated channels, controlling pathways for movement, memory, and consciousness. Most anesthetics probably \nact on more than one, and they don't act on \njust the nervous system. Many anesthetics also affect the heart, lungs, and other vital organs. Just like early anesthetics, which included familiar poisons like\nhemlock and aconite, modern drugs can \nhave serious side effects. So an anesthesiologist has to mix\njust the right balance of drugs to create all the features of anesthesia, while carefully monitoring\nthe patient's vital signs, and adjusting the drug mixture as needed. Anesthesia is complicated, but figuring out how to use it allowed for the development \nof new and better surgical techniques. Surgeons could learn how to routinely\nand safely perform C-sections, reopen blocked arteries, replace damaged livers and kidneys, and many other life-saving operations. And each year, new anesthesia techniques\nare developed that will ensure more and more patients\nsurvive the trauma of surgery. "

        "description": "Like an actor's script, a sheet of music instructs a musician on what to play (the pitch) and when to play it (the rhythm). Sheet music may look complicated, but once you've gotten the hang of a few simple elements like notes, bars and clefs, you're ready to rock. Tim Hansen hits the instrumental basics you need to read music.",
        "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZN41d7Txcq0/hqdefault.jpg",
        "text": "When we watch a film or a play, we know that the actors probably learned\ntheir lines from a script, which essentially tells them\nwhat to say and when to say it. A piece of written music\noperates on exactly the same principle. In a very basic sense, it tells a performer what to play\nand when to play it. Aesthetically speaking,\nthere's a world of difference between, say, Beethoven and Justin Bieber, but both artists have used the same building blocks\nto create their music: notes. And although the end result\ncan sound quite complicated, the logic behind musical notes\nis actually pretty straightforward. Let's take a look at the foundational\nelements to music notation and how they interact\nto create a work of art. Music is written on five parallel lines\nthat go across the page. These five lines are called a staff, and a staff operates on two axes: up and down and left to right. The up-and-down axis tells the performer the pitch of the note\nor what note to play, and the left-to-right axis tells the performer the rhythm of the note or when to play it. Let's start with pitch. To help us out,\nwe're going to use a piano, but this system works for pretty much\nany instrument you can think of. In the Western music tradition, pitches are named after\nthe first seven letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. After that, the cycle repeats itself: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and so on. But how do these pitches get their names? Well, for example, if you played an F and then played another F higher or lower on the piano, you'd notice that they sound\npretty similar compared to, say, a B. Going back to the staff, every line and every space\nbetween two lines represents a separate pitch. If we put a note on one of these lines\nor one of these spaces, we're telling a performer\nto play that pitch. The higher up on the staff\na note is placed, the higher the pitch. But there are obviously\nmany, many more pitches than the nine that these\nlines and spaces gives us. A grand piano, for example, can play 88 separate notes. So how do we condense\n88 notes onto a single staff? We use something called a clef, a weird-looking figure\nplaced at the beginning of the staff, which acts like a reference point, telling you that a particular\nline or space corresponds to a specific note\non your instrument. If we want to play notes\nthat aren't on the staff, we kind of cheat and draw\nextra little lines called ledger lines and place the notes on them. If we have to draw so many ledger lines\nthat it gets confusing, then we need to change\nto a different clef. As for telling a performer\nwhen to play the notes, two main elements control this: the beat and the rhythm. The beat of a piece of music is, by itself, kind of boring. It sounds like this. (Ticking) Notice that it doesn't change, it just plugs along quite happily. It can go slow or fast or whatever you like, really. The point is that just\nlike the second hand on a clock divides one minute into sixty seconds, with each second just as long\nas every other second, the beat divides a piece of music into little fragments of time\nthat are all the same length: beats. With a steady beat as a foundation, we can add rhythm to our pitches, and that's when music\nreally starts to happen. This is a quarter note. It's the most basic unit of rhythm, and it's worth one beat. This is a half note,\nand it's worth two beats. This whole note here is worth four beats, and these little guys are eighth notes, worth half a beat each. \"Great,\" you say, \"what does that mean?\" You might have noticed\nthat across the length of a staff, there are little lines dividing it\ninto small sections. These are bar lines and we refer to each section as a bar. At the beginning of a piece of music, just after the clef, is something called the time signature, which tells a performer\nhow many beats are in each bar. This says there are two beats in each bar, this says there are three, this one four, and so on. The bottom number tells\nus what kind of note is to be used as the basic\nunit for the beat. One corresponds to a whole note, two to a half note, four to a quarter note, and eight to an eighth note, and so on. So this time signature here tells us that there are four\nquarter notes in each bar, one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four, and so on. But like I said before, if we just stick to the beat, it gets kind of boring, so we'll replace some quarter notes\nwith different rhythms. Notice that even though\nthe number of notes in each bar has changed, the total number of beats\nin each bar hasn't. So, what does our musical\ncreation sound like? (Music) Eh, sounds okay, but maybe\na bit thin, right? Let's add another instrument\nwith its own pitch and rhythm. Now it's sounding like music. Sure, it takes some practice\nto get used to reading it quickly and playing what we see on our instrument, but, with a bit of time and patience, you could be the next Beethoven or Justin Bieber. "

Dawn Maslar explores how our five senses contribute to this mating game, citing some pretty wild studies along the way.\n\nLesson by Dawn Maslar, animation by TOGETHER.",

        "text": "We like to think of romantic feelings as spontaneous and indescribable\nthings that come from the heart. But it's actually your brain running a complex series of calculations\nwithin a matter of seconds that's responsible\nfor determining attraction. Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it? But just because the calculations\nare happening in your brain doesn't mean those warm,\nfuzzy feelings are all in your head. In fact, all five\nof your senses play a role, each able to vote for,\nor veto, a budding attraction. The eyes are the first\ncomponents in attraction. Many visual beauty standards vary\nbetween cultures and eras, and signs of youth,\nfertility and good health, such as long lustrous hair, or smooth, scar-free skin, are almost always in demand because they're associated\nwith reproductive fitness. And when the eyes spot\nsomething they like, our instinct is to move closer so the other senses can investigate. The nose's contribution to romance is more than noticing perfume or cologne. It's able to pick up\non natural chemical signals known as pheromones. These not only convey important physical or genetic information\nabout their source but are able to activate a physiological\nor behavioral response in the recipient. In one study, a group of women at different points\nin their ovulation cycles wore the same T-shirts for three nights. After male volunteers\nwere randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn shirts,\nor a new unworn one, saliva samples showed\nan increase in testosterone in those who had smelled a shirt worn\nby an ovulating woman. Such a testosterone boost may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman he might not have otherwise noticed. A woman's nose is particularly attuned to MHC molecules,\nwhich are used to fight disease. In this case, opposites attract. When a study asked women to smell T-shirts\nthat had been worn by different men, they preferred the odors of those\nwhose MHC molecules differed from theirs. This makes sense. Genes that result in a greater\nvariety of immunities may give offspring\na major survival advantage. Our ears also determine attraction. Men prefer females\nwith high-pitched, breathy voices, and wide formant spacing,\ncorrelated with smaller body size. While women prefer low-pitched voices\nwith a narrow formant spacing that suggest a larger body size. And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance. In this experiment,\nnot realizing the study had begun, participants were asked\nto briefly hold the coffee, either hot or iced. Later, the participants read a story\nabout a hypothetical person, and were asked to rate their personality. Those who had held the hot cup of coffee perceived the person\nin the story as happier, more social, more generous\nand better-natured than those who had held\nthe cup of iced coffee, who rated the person as cold,\nstoic, and unaffectionate. If a potential mate has managed\nto pass all these tests, there's still one more: the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange\nof tactile and chemical cues, such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth. This magical moment is so critical\nthat a majority of men and women have reported losing\ntheir attraction to someone after a bad first kiss. Once attraction is confirmed,\nyour bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine, activating your fight or flight system. Your heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose\nfor additional energy, not because you're in danger\nbut because your body is telling you that something important is happening. To help you focus, norepinephrine creates\na sort of tunnel vision, blocking out surrounding distractions, possibly even warping your sense of time, and enhancing your memory. This might explain why people\nnever forget their first kiss. The idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals\nand evolutionary biology may seem cold and scientific\nrather than romantic, but the next time\nyou see someone you like, try to appreciate how your entire body\nis playing matchmaker to decide if that beautiful\nstranger is right for you.

        "text": "The DNA in just one of your cells gets damaged tens of thousands \nof times per day. Multiply that by your body's\nhundred trillion or so cells, and you've got a quintillion \nDNA errors everyday. And because DNA provides the blueprint for the proteins \nyour cells need to function, damage causes serious problems,\nsuch as cancer. The errors come in different forms. Sometimes nucleotides, \nDNA's building blocks, get damaged, other times nucleotides \nget matched up incorrectly, causing mutations, and nicks in one or both strands\ncan interfere with DNA replication, or even cause sections \nof DNA to get mixed up. Fortunately, your cells have ways\nof fixing most of these problems most of the time. These repair pathways \nall rely on specialized enzymes. Different ones respond \nto different types of damage. One common error is base mismatches. Each nucleotide contains a base, and during DNA replication, the enzyme DNA polymerase\nis supposed to bring in the right partner to pair with every base \non each template strand. Adenine with thymine,\nand guanine with cytosine. But about once every \nhundred thousand additions, it makes a mistake. The enzyme catches \nmost of these right away, and cuts off a few nucleotides\nand replaces them with the correct ones. And just in case it missed a few, a second set of proteins \ncomes behind it to check. If they find a mismatch, they cut out the incorrect nucleotide\nand replace it. This is called mismatch repair. Together, these two systems reduce\nthe number of base mismatch errors to about one in one billion. But DNA can get damaged\nafter replication, too. Lots of different molecules\ncan cause chemical changes to nucleotides. Some of these come \nfrom environmental exposure, like certain compounds in tobacco smoke. But others are molecules that are found\nin cells naturally, like hydrogen peroxide. Certain chemical changes are so common that they have specific enzymes assigned\nto reverse the damage. But the cell also has more general\nrepair pathways. If just one base is damaged, it can usually be fixed by a process\ncalled base excision repair. One enzyme snips out the damaged base, and other enzymes come in to trim around\nthe site and replace the nucleotides. UV light can cause damage \nthat's a little harder to fix. Sometimes, it causes two adjacent\nnucleotides to stick together, distorting the DNA's double helix shape. Damage like this requires \na more complex process called nucleotide excision repair. A team of proteins removes a long strand\nof 24 or so nucleotides, and replaces them with fresh ones. Very high frequency radiation,\nlike gamma rays and x-rays, cause a different kind of damage. They can actually sever one \nor both strands of the DNA backbone. Double strand breaks\nare the most dangerous. Even one can cause cell death. The two most common pathways\nfor repairing double strand breaks are called homologous recombination\nand non-homologous end joining. Homologous recombination uses an undamaged\nsection of similar DNA as a template. Enzymes interlace the damaged\nand undamgaed strands, get them to exchange sequences\nof nucleotides, and finally fill in the missing gaps to end up with two complete\ndouble-stranded segments. Non-homologous end joining,\non the other hand, doesn't rely on a template. Instead, a series of proteins\ntrims off a few nucleotides and then fuses the broken ends \nback together. This process isn't as accurate. It can cause genes to get mixed up,\nor moved around. But it's useful when \nsister DNA isn't available. Of course, changes to DNA \naren't always bad. Beneficial mutations \ncan allow a species to evolve. But most of the time, \nwe want DNA to stay the same. Defects in DNA repair are associated\nwith premature aging and many kinds of cancer. So if you're looking for \na fountain of youth, it's already operating in your cells, billions and billions of times a day. "

In that moment, you may feel more\nlike throwing your battery across the room than singing its praises, but batteries are a triumph of science. They allow smartphones \nand other technologies to exist without anchoring us \nto an infernal tangle of power cables. Yet even the best batteries\nwill diminish daily, slowly losing capacity \nuntil they finally die. So why does this happen, and how do our batteries even store\nso much charge in the first place? It all started in the 1780s\nwith two Italian scientists, Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, and a frog. Legend has it that as Galvani\nwas studying a frog's leg, he brushed a metal instrument \nup against one of its nerves, making the leg muscles jerk. Galvani called this animal electricity, believing that a type of electricity\nwas stored in the very stuff of life. But Volta disagreed, arguing that it was the metal itself\nthat made the leg twitch. The debate was eventually settled\nwith Volta's groundbreaking experiment. He tested his idea with a stack\nof alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper or cloth\nsoaked in a salt water solution. What happened in Volta's cell is something\nchemists now call oxidation and reduction. The zinc oxidizes,\nwhich means it loses electrons, which are, in turn, gained by the ions in\nthe water in a process called reduction, producing hydrogen gas. Volta would have been shocked \nto learn that last bit. He thought the reaction \nwas happening in the copper, rather than the solution. None the less, \nwe honor Volta's discovery today by naming our standard unit \nof electric potential \"the volt.\" This oxidation-reduction cycle creates\na flow of electrons between two substances and if you hook a lightbulb \nor vacuum cleaner up between the two, you'll give it power. Since the 1700s, scientists have improved\non Volta's design. They've replaced the chemical solution\nwith dry cells filled with chemical paste, but the principle is the same. A metal oxidizes, \nsending electrons to do some work before they are regained \nby a substance being reduced. But any battery has a finite \nsupply of metal, and once most of it has oxidized, \nthe battery dies. So rechargeable batteries give us \na temporary solution to this problem by making the oxidation-reduction \nprocess reversible. Electrons can flow back \nin the opposite direction with the application of electricity. Plugging in a charger draws \nthe electricity from a wall outlet that drives the reaction \nto regenerate the metal, making more electrons available \nfor oxidation the next time you need them. But even rechargeable batteries \ndon't last forever. Over time, the repetition of this process\ncauses imperfections and irregularities in the metal's surface\nthat prevent it from oxidizing properly. The electrons are no longer available\nto flow through a circuit and the battery dies. Some everyday rechargeable batteries will die after only hundreds \nof discharge-recharge cycles, while newer, advanced batteries\ncan survive and function for thousands. Batteries of the future \nmay be light, thin sheets that operate on the principles \nof quantum physics and last for hundreds \nof thousands of charge cycles. But until scientists find a way \nto take advantage of motion to recharge your cell battery,\nlike cars do, or fit solar panels \nsomewhere on your device, plugging your charger into the wall, rather than expending \none battery to charge another is your best bet to forestall \nthat fatal \"bleep.\" "

Nowadays, capacitive and resistive \ntouchscreens are two of the most common types. Both use an external input \nto complete their electric circuits. In conductive materials, \nelectrons flow around atoms, forming an electric current. In contrast to insulators, the electrons in conductors are\nweakly bound and flow easily. A resistive touchscreen has two layers. The top is a clear, flexible material—\nusually plastic— while the bottom is something rigid,\nlike glass. These layers are coated \nwith a conductive substance and separated by a thin gap. When something pushes\nhard enough, the layers connect, completing the electric circuit. This causes a change in voltage \nthat the machine’s software reacts to. Resistive touchscreens can\nbe a little unresponsive, but they're generally cheap and durable, so they're favored for industrial\nor mass use. A vast majority of the touchscreens\nproduced in 2007 were resistive. But in the years following \nthe iPhone’s release, most became capacitive. Individual models vary, \nbut smartphone touchscreens today typically consist of a protective, \ninsulating glass exterior and an LCD screen at the bottom \nthat produces the images you see. Between the glass exterior \nand the LCD screen are several sheets. One is lined with rows of a transparent,\nconductive material that carry an alternating \nelectric current. A thin insulating layer separates these\nconductive lines from others that are arranged as columns. One on top of the other, \nthe lines form a grid. The points where they intersect\nare called nodes. The phone's battery draws electrons\nalong the first layer of lines, and some electrons accumulate \nat every node, creating a small electric field. These screens are called \ncapacitive touchscreens because the nodes act like capacitors\nby storing charge. They’re generally easier to use\nthan resistive touchscreens because they interact directly with your\nfinger without the application of force. Your body is a great conductor and is\nconstantly transmitting electric currents. Why? Because about 60% of you is water. Now, while chemically pure water \nis an insulator, most water is impure. The water inside you is loaded with ions— atoms or molecules that have\na net electrical charge. So when you click on an app, your finger\nfunctions like a third electrical line. It interacts with the existing\nelectric field, which induces a weak electric current\nthat travels through your finger and eventually back into the phone. This changes the amount of charge\nat the affected nodes. And voltage measurements along\nthe second layer of lines tell the phone’s microprocessor which\npart of the screen is being touched. However, if you try using a smartphone\nwhile your hands are wet or gloved, you'll probably have some trouble. Both interrupt the electrical connection\nbetween your finger and phone. If water is splashed across the screen,\nit might trigger many underlying nodes, and the phone could act like you’ve \ntouched it in multiple places at once. On the other hand, gloves are insulators,\nso the charge has nowhere to go. Meanwhile, objects that conduct\nelectricity about as well as your finger— like banana peels \nand certain processed meats— can all activate the screen— knowledge that can come in clutch,\nwhen you’re in a pickle.

        "text": "Did you know that every time\nmusicians pick up their instruments, there are fireworks going off\nall over their brain? On the outside,\nthey may look calm and focused, reading the music and making the precise\nand practiced movements required. But inside their brains,\nthere's a party going on. How do we know this? Well, in the last few decades, neuroscientists have made\nenormous breakthroughs in understanding how our brains work\nby monitoring them in real time with instruments like\nfMRI and PET scanners. When people are hooked up\nto these machines, tasks, such as reading\nor doing math problems, each have corresponding areas of the brain\nwhere activity can be observed. But when researchers got\nthe participants to listen to music, they saw fireworks. Multiple areas of their brains\nwere lighting up at once, as they processed the sound, took it apart to understand elements\nlike melody and rhythm, and then put it all back together\ninto unified musical experience. And our brains do all this work\nin the split second between when we first hear the music\nand when our foot starts to tap along. But when scientists turned\nfrom observing the brains of music listeners to those of musicians, the little backyard fireworks\nbecame a jubilee. It turns out that while listening\nto music engages the brain in some pretty interesting activities, playing music is the brain's equivalent\nof a full-body workout. The neuroscientists saw\nmultiple areas of the brain light up, simultaneously processing\ndifferent information in intricate, interrelated,\nand astonishingly fast sequences. But what is it about making music\nthat sets the brain alight? The research is still fairly new, but neuroscientists\nhave a pretty good idea. Playing a musical instrument engages practically every area\nof the brain at once, especially the visual,\nauditory, and motor cortices. As with any other workout, disciplined,\nstructured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions,\nallowing us to apply that strength to other activities. The most obvious difference between\nlistening to music and playing it is that the latter requires\nfine motor skills, which are controlled\nin both hemispheres of the brain. It also combines the linguistic\nand mathematical precision, in which the left hemisphere\nis more involved, with the novel and creative\ncontent that the right excels in. For these reasons,\nplaying music has been found to increase the volume and activity\nin the brain's corpus callosum, the bridge between the two hemispheres, allowing messages to get across the brain\nfaster and through more diverse routes. This may allow musicians to solve problems more effectively and creatively,\nin both academic and social settings. Because making music also involves\ncrafting and understanding its emotional content and message, musicians often have higher levels\nof executive function, a category of interlinked tasks that includes planning, strategizing,\nand attention to detail and requires simultaneous analysis\nof both cognitive and emotional aspects. This ability also has an impact\non how our memory systems work. And, indeed, musicians exhibit\nenhanced memory functions, creating, storing, and retrieving memories\nmore quickly and efficiently. Studies have found that musicians appear\nto use their highly connected brains to give each memory multiple tags, such as a conceptual tag,\nan emotional tag, an audio tag, and a contextual tag, like a good Internet search engine. How do we know that all these benefits\nare unique to music, as opposed to, say, sports or painting? Or could it be\nthat people who go into music were already smarter to begin with? Neuroscientists have explored\nthese issues, but so far, they have found that the artistic\nand aesthetic aspects of learning to play a musical instrument are different from any other activity\nstudied, including other arts. And several randomized studies\nof participants, who showed the same levels of cognitive function\nand neural processing at the start, found that those who were exposed\nto a period of music learning showed enhancement in multiple\nbrain areas, compared to the others. This recent research about\nthe mental benefits of playing music has advanced our understanding\nof mental function, revealing the inner rhythms\nand complex interplay that make up the amazing\norchestra of our brain.

        "text": "Professor Fukanō, the famous \neccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop\nin a plane of his own design. Able to travel consistently at the\nincredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours\nto circle the world. There's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters\nof fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey. Let's be honest. The professor probably could have\ndesigned the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that? Instead, he's devised a slightly more\nelaborate solution: building three identical planes\nfor the mission. In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them\nwith a few other incredible features. Each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount\nof its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other. The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants Fugōri\nand Orokana will pilot each of the others. However, only one airport,\nlocated on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where \nthe planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground. How should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously\nfor the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out \nof fuel and crashing? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off\nby a hair. The key is to maximize the support\neach assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel. It also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips\nin either direction while setting the professor up for a long\nunsupported stretch in the middle. Here's his solution. All three planes take off at noon\nflying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters. After 45 minutes, or one-eighth\nof the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left. Orokana gives 45 to the professor\nand 45 to Fugōri, fully refueling them both. With her remaining 45, \nOrokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge\nfor a well-deserved break. 45 minutes later, with one-quarter\nof the trip complete, the professor and Fugōri\nare both at 135 kiloliters again. Fugōri transfers 45 \ninto the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90\nhe needs to return. Professor Fukanō stretches\nand puts on his favorite album. He'll be alone for a while. In the meantime, Orokana has been\nanxiously awaiting Fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go. As soon as his plane touches the ground,\nshe takes off, this time flying east. At this point, exactly 180 minutes \nhave passed and the professor is at the halfway point\nof his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left. For the next 90 minutes, the professor and Orokana's planes \nfly towards each other, meeting at the three-quarter mark. Just as the professor's fuel \nis about the run out, he sees Orokana's plane. She gives him 45 kiloliters \nof her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each. But that's just half of what they need\nto make it to the airport. Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri,\nhaving refueled, takes off. 45 minutes later, just as the other two\nplanes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel\nto each, leaving 45 for himself. All three planes land at the airport\njust as their fuel gauges reach zero. As the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will\nsoon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how \nto keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere.

        "text": "What makes a good horror story? Sure, you could throw \nin some hideous monsters, fountains of blood, and things jumping out from every corner, but as classic horror author\nH.P. Lovecraft wrote, \"The oldest and strongest\nkind of fear is fear of the unknown.\" And writers harness that fear\nnot by revealing horrors, but by leaving the audience hanging\nin anticipation of them. That is, in a state of suspense. The most familiar examples of suspense\ncome from horror films and mystery novels. What's inside the haunted mansion? Which of the dinner guests \nis the murderer? But suspense exists beyond these genres. Will the hero save the day? Will the couple get together\nin the end? And what is the dark secret that causes\nthe main character so much pain? The key to suspense is that it sets up\na question, or several, that the audience hopes \nto get an answer to and delays that answer while maintaining\ntheir interest and keeping them guessing. So what are some techniques you can use\nto achieve this in your own writing? Limit the point of view. Instead of an omniscient narrator who can\nsee and relay everything that happens, tell the story from the perspective\nof the characters. They may start off knowing just\nas little as the audience does, and as they learn more, so do we. Classic novels, like \"Dracula,\" for example,\nare told through letters and diary entries where characters relate\nwhat they've experienced and fear what's to come. Next, choose the right setting \nand imagery. Old mansions or castles with winding\nhalls and secret passageways suggest that disturbing things\nare being concealed. Nighttime, fog, and storms all play\nsimilar roles in limiting visibility and restricting characters' movements. That's why Victorian London is such\na popular setting. And even ordinary places and objects\ncan be made sinister as in the Gothic novel \"Rebecca\" where the flowers at the protagonist's\nnew home are described as blood red. Three: play with style and form. You can build suspense by carefully\npaying attention not just to what happens but how it's conveyed and paced. Edgar Allan Poe conveys the mental state\nof the narrator in \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" with fragmented sentences\nthat break off suddenly. And other short declarative sentences\nin the story create a mix of breathless speed\nand weighty pauses. On the screen, Alfred Hitchcock's\ncinematography is known for its use of extended\nsilences and shots of staircases to create a feeling of discomfort. Four: use dramatic irony. You can't just keep the audience\nin the dark forever. Sometimes, suspense is best served by revealing key parts of the big secret\nto the audience but not to the characters. This is a technique known \nas dramatic irony, where the mystery becomes\nnot what will happen but when and how \nthe characters will learn. In the classic play \"Oedipus Rex,\" the title character is unaware\nthat he has killed his own father and married his mother. But the audience knows, and watching\nOedipus gradually learn the truth provides the story \nwith its agonizing climax. And finally, the cliffhanger. Beware of overusing this one. Some consider it a cheap and easy trick,\nbut it's hard to deny its effectiveness. This is where a chapter, episode,\nvolume, or season cuts off right before something\ncrucial is revealed, or in the midst of a dangerous situation\nwith a slim chance of hope. The wait, whether moments or years, makes us imagine possibilities about\nwhat could happen next, building extra suspense. The awful thing is almost always averted, creating a sense of closure \nand emotional release. But that doesn't stop us from worrying\nand wondering the next time the protagonists face \nnear-certain disaster. "

Theirs was a short voyage\nwith massive consequences. And around the same period of time, other groups of Normans\nwere setting forth all across Europe, going on adventures that would reverberate\nthroughout that continent’s history. So who were these warriors and how did they leave \ntheir mark so far and wide? Our story begins \nover 200 years earlier, when Vikings began to settle \non the shores of northern France as part of a great Scandinavian exodus \nacross northern Europe. The French locals called \nthese invaders Normans, named for the direction they came from. Eventually, Charles, \nthe king of the Franks, negotiated peace with \nthe Viking leader Rollo in 911, granting him a stretch of land \nalong France’s northern coast that came to be known as Normandy. The Normans proved adaptable\nto their newly settled life. They married Frankish women, adopted the French language, and soon started converting \nfrom Norse paganism to Christianity. But though they adapted, they maintained the warrior tradition and conquering spirit \nof their Viking forebears. Before long, ambitious Norman knights \nwere looking for new challenges. The Normans’ best-known achievement \nwas their conquest of England. In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy, disputed the claim of \nthe new English king, Harold Godwinson. Soon after landing in England, William and his knights met Harold’s army \nnear the town of Hastings. The climactic moment in the battle is immortalized in \nthe 70-meter-long Bayeux Tapestry, where an arrow striking Harold \nin the eye seals the Norman victory. William consolidated his gains \nwith a huge castle-building campaign and a reorganization of English society. He lived up to his nickname \n\"William the Conqueror\" through a massive survey\nknown as the Domesday Book, which recorded the population\nand ownership of every piece of land in England. Norman French became the language \nof the new royal court, while commoners continued \nto speak Anglo-Saxon. Over time, the two merged \nto give us the English we know today, though the divide between lords \nand peasants can still be felt in synonym pairs such as cow and beef. By the end of the 12th century, the Normans had further expanded \ninto Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Meanwhile, independent groups \nof Norman knights traveled to the Mediterranean, inspired by tales of pilgrims \nreturning from Jerusalem. There, they threw themselves \ninto a tangled mass of conflicts among the established powers \nall over that region. They became highly prized mercenaries, and during one of these battles, they made the first recorded \nheavy cavalry charge with couched lances, a devastating tactic that soon became \nstandard in medieval warfare. The Normans were also central \nto the First Crusade of 1095-99, a bloody conflict that re-established\nChristian control in certain parts of the Middle East. But the Normans did more than just fight. As a result of their victories, leaders like William Iron-Arm \nand Robert the Crafty secured lands throughout Southern Italy, eventually merging them\nto form the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. Under Roger II, the kingdom became a beacon of\nmulticultural tolerance in a world torn apart \nby religious and civil wars. Muslim Arab poets and scholars \nserved in the royal court alongside Byzantine Greek sailors \nand architects. Arabic remained an official language along\nwith Latin, Greek, and Norman French. The world’s geographical knowledge \nwas compiled in The Book of Roger, whose maps of the known world would remain the most accurate \navailable for 300 years. And the churches built in Palermo\ncombined Latin-style architecture, Arab ceilings, and Byzantine domes, all decorated with\nexquisite golden mosaics. So if the Normans were so successful,\nwhy aren’t they still around? In fact, this was a key part of\ntheir success: not just ruling the societies \nthey conquered, but becoming part of them. Although the Normans eventually \ndisappeared as a distinct group, their contributions remained. And today, from the castles and\ncathedrals that dot Europe’s landscape to wherever \nthe English language is spoken, the Norman legacy lives on. "

But for the lucky males and females \nof Solenopsis invicta, otherwise known as fire ants, \nit’s a day of romance. This is the nuptial flight, when thousands of reproduction-capable \nmale and female ants, called alates, \ntake wing for the first and last time. But even for successful males \nwho manage to avoid winged predators, this mating frenzy will prove lethal. And for a successfully mated female, \nher work is only beginning. Having secured a lifetime supply of sperm \nfrom her departed mate, our new queen must now single-handedly \nstart an entire colony. Descending to the ground, she searches for a suitable spot \nto build her nest. Ideally, she can find somewhere \nwith loose, easy-to-dig soil— like farmland \nalready disturbed by human activity. Once she finds the perfect spot, \nshe breaks off her wings— creating the stubs \nthat establish her royal status. Then, she starts digging \na descending tunnel ending in a chamber. Here the queen begins laying her eggs, \nabout ten per day, and the first larvae hatch within a week. Over the next three weeks, the new queen relies on a separate batch \nof unfertilized eggs to nourish both herself and her brood, losing half her body weight \nin the process. Thankfully, after about 20 days, these larvae grow \ninto the first generation of workers, ready to forage for food \nand sustain their shrunken queen. Her daughters \nwill have to work quickly though— returning their mother \nto good health is urgent. In the surrounding area, dozens of neighboring queens \nare building their own ant armies. These colonies \nhave peacefully coexisted so far, but once workers appear, a phenomenon known as brood-raiding \nbegins. Workers from nests \nup to several meters away begin to steal offspring \nfrom our queen. Our colony retaliates, but new waves of raiders \nfrom even further away overwhelm the workers. Within hours, the raiders have taken \nour queen’s entire brood supply to the largest nearby nest— and the queen’s surviving daughters \nabandon her. Chasing her last chance of survival, the queen follows the raiding trail \nto the winning nest. She fends off other losing queens \nand the defending nest’s workers, fighting her way \nto the top of the brood pile. Her daughters help their mother succeed \nwhere other queens fail— defeating the reigning monarch, \nand usurping the brood pile. Eventually, \nall the remaining challengers fail, until only one queen— \nand one brood pile— remains. Now presiding over several hundred workers\nin the neighborhood’s largest nest, our victorious queen begins \naiding her colony in its primary goal: reproduction. For the next several years, \nthe colony only produces sterile workers. But once their population \nexceeds about 23,000, it changes course. From now on, every spring, the colony will produce \nfertile alate males and females. The colony spawns these larger ants \nthroughout the early summer, and returns to worker production \nin the fall. After heavy rainfalls, \nthese alates take to the skies, and spread their queen’s genes \nup to a couple hundred meters downwind. But to contribute \nto this annual mating frenzy, the colony must continue to thrive \nas one massive super-organism. Every day, younger ants feed the queen \nand tend to the brood, while older workers \nforage for food and defend the nest. When intruders strike, these older warriors fend them off \nusing poisonous venom. After rainfalls, \nthe colony comes together, using the wet dirt to expand their nest. And when a disastrous flood \ndrowns their home, the sisters band together \ninto a massive living raft— carrying their queen to safety. But no matter how resilient, the life of a colony must come to an end. After about 8 years, \nour queen runs out of sperm and can no longer replace dying workers. The nest’s population dwindles, \nand eventually, they’re taken over \nby a neighboring colony. Our queen’s reign is over, \nbut her genetic legacy lives on. "

        "text": "Picture warm, gooey cookies, crunchy candies, velvety cakes, waffle cones piled high with ice cream. Is your mouth watering? Are you craving dessert? Why? What happens in the brain\nthat makes sugary foods so hard to resist? Sugar is a general term\nused to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates, and it's found in a wide variety\nof food and drink. Just check the labels\non sweet products you buy. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, dextrose, and starch are all forms of sugar. So are high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, raw sugar, and honey. And sugar isn't just\nin candies and desserts, it's also added to tomato sauce, yogurt, dried fruit,\nflavored waters, or granola bars. Since sugar is everywhere,\nit's important to understand how it affects the brain. What happens when sugar hits your tongue? And does eating a little bit of sugar\nmake you crave more? You take a bite of cereal. The sugars it contains activate\nthe sweet-taste receptors, part of the taste buds on the tongue. These receptors send a signal\nup to the brain stem, and from there, it forks off\ninto many areas of the forebrain, one of which is the cerebral cortex. Different sections of the cerebral cortex\nprocess different tastes: bitter, salty, umami, and, in our case, sweet. From here, the signal activates\nthe brain's reward system. This reward system is a series\nof electrical and chemical pathways across several different\nregions of the brain. It's a complicated network, but it helps answer a single,\nsubconscious question: should I do that again? That warm, fuzzy feeling you get\nwhen you taste Grandma's chocolate cake? That's your reward system saying, \"Mmm, yes!\" And it's not just activated by food. Socializing, sexual behavior, and drugs are just a few examples\nof things and experiences that also activate the reward system. But overactivating this reward system\nkickstarts a series of unfortunate events: loss of control, craving,\nand increased tolerance to sugar. Let's get back to our bite of cereal. It travels down into your stomach\nand eventually into your gut. And guess what? There are sugar receptors here, too. They are not taste buds,\nbut they do send signals telling your brain that you're full or that your body should\nproduce more insulin to deal with the extra sugar\nyou're eating. The major currency\nof our reward system is dopamine, an important chemical or neurotransmitter. There are many dopamine\nreceptors in the forebrain, but they're not evenly distributed. Certain areas contain dense\nclusters of receptors, and these dopamine hot spots\nare a part of our reward system. Drugs like alcohol, nicotine, or heroin send dopamine into overdrive, leading some people\nto constantly seek that high, in other words, to be addicted. Sugar also causes dopamine to be released,\nthough not as violently as drugs. And sugar is rare\namong dopamine-inducing foods. Broccoli, for example, has no effect, which probably explains why it's so hard to get\nkids to eat their veggies. Speaking of healthy foods, let's say you're hungry\nand decide to eat a balanced meal. You do, and dopamine levels spike\nin the reward system hot spots. But if you eat that same dish\nmany days in a row, dopamine levels will spike less and less,\neventually leveling out. That's because when it comes to food, the brain evolved to pay special attention\nto new or different tastes. Why? Two reasons: first, to detect food that's gone bad. And second, because the more variety\nwe have in our diet, the more likely we are\nto get all the nutrients we need. To keep that variety up, we need to be able\nto recognize a new food, and more importantly, we need\nto want to keep eating new foods. And that's why the dopamine levels off\nwhen a food becomes boring. Now, back to that meal. What happens if in place\nof the healthy, balanced dish, you eat sugar-rich food instead? If you rarely eat sugar\nor don't eat much at a time, the effect is similar\nto that of the balanced meal. But if you eat too much,\nthe dopamine response does not level out. In other words, eating lots of sugar\nwill continue to feel rewarding. In this way, sugar behaves\na little bit like a drug. It's one reason people seem\nto be hooked on sugary foods. So, think back to all those\ndifferent kinds of sugar. Each one is unique,\nbut every time any sugar is consumed, it kickstarts a domino effect in the brain\nthat sparks a rewarding feeling. Too much, too often,\nand things can go into overdrive. So, yes, overconsumption of sugar\ncan have addictive effects on the brain, but a wedge of cake once\nin a while won't hurt you. "

        "text": "¿Hablas español? Parlez-vous français? \n你会说中文吗？ If you answered, \"sí,\" \"oui,\" or \"会\"\nand you're watching this in English, chances are you belong to the world's\nbilingual and multilingual majority. And besides having \nan easier time traveling or watching movies without subtitles, knowing two or more languages\nmeans that your brain may actually look and work differently\nthan those of your monolingual friends. So what does it really \nmean to know a language? Language ability is typically measured\nin two active parts, speaking and writing, and two passive parts, \nlistening and reading. While a balanced bilingual has near equal abilities across the board \nin two languages, most bilinguals around the world\nknow and use their languages in varying proportions. And depending on their situation\nand how they acquired each language, they can be classified into\nthree general types. For example, let's take Gabriella, whose family immigrates to the US \nfrom Peru when she's two-years old. As a compound bilingual, Gabriella develops two linguistic \ncodes simultaneously, with a single set of concepts, learning both English and Spanish as she begins to process \nthe world around her. Her teenage brother, on the other hand,\nmight be a coordinate bilingual, working with two sets of concepts, learning English in school, while continuing to speak Spanish\nat home and with friends. Finally, Gabriella's parents are likely\nto be subordinate bilinguals who learn a secondary language by filtering it through\ntheir primary language. Because all types of bilingual people\ncan become fully proficient in a language regardless of accent or pronunciation, the difference may not be apparent\nto a casual observer. But recent advances \nin brain imaging technology have given neurolinguists a glimpse into how specific aspects of language\nlearning affect the bilingual brain. It's well known that the brain's\nleft hemisphere is more dominant and analytical in logical processes, while the right hemisphere is more active\nin emotional and social ones, though this is a matter of degree,\nnot an absolute split. The fact that language involves\nboth types of functions while lateralization develops\ngradually with age, has lead to the critical \nperiod hypothesis. According to this theory, children learn languages more easily because the plasticity \nof their developing brains lets them use both hemispheres\nin language acquisition, while in most adults, language \nis lateralized to one hemisphere, usually the left. If this is true, learning a language\nin childhood may give you a more holistic grasp\nof its social and emotional contexts. Conversely, recent research showed that people who learned \na second language in adulthood exhibit less emotional bias\nand a more rational approach when confronting problems\nin the second language than in their native one. But regardless of when you acquire\nadditional languages, being multilingual gives your brain\nsome remarkable advantages. Some of these are even visible, such as higher density of the grey matter that contains most of your brain's \nneurons and synapses, and more activity in certain regions\nwhen engaging a second language. The heightened workout a bilingual\nbrain receives throughout its life can also help delay the onset of diseases,\nlike Alzheimer's and dementia by as much as five years. The idea of major cognitive \nbenefits to bilingualism may seem intuitive now, but it would have surprised \nearlier experts. Before the 1960s, bilingualism\nwas considered a handicap that slowed a child's development by forcing them to spend too much energy\ndistinguishing between languages, a view based largely on flawed studies. And while a more recent study did show that reaction times and errors increase\nfor some bilingual students in cross-language tests, it also showed that the effort\nand attention needed to switch between languages\ntriggered more activity in, and potentially strengthened,\nthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This is the part of the brain\nthat plays a large role in executive function, problem solving,\nswitching between tasks, and focusing while filtering out\nirrelevant information. So, while bilingualism may not\nnecessarily make you smarter, it does make your brain more healthy,\ncomplex and actively engaged, and even if you didn't have \nthe good fortune of learning a second language as a child, it's never too late to do \nyourself a favor and make the linguistic \nleap from, \"Hello,\" to, \"Hola,\" \"Bonjour\" or \"你好’s\" because when it comes to our brains\na little exercise can go a long way.

        "text": "Muscles and joints shift and jostle. The heart’s pounding rhythm speeds up. \nBlood roars through arteries and veins. Over the course of a pregnancy, \nevery organ in the body changes. Ignited by a range of hormones, these changes begin \nas soon as pregnancy begins. Just days after fertilization, the embryo \nimplants in the lining of the uterus. Because its DNA doesn’t exactly match \nthe mother’s, the immune system should theoretically \nrecognize it as an invader, attack, and destroy it, like it would \nbacteria or other harmful microbes. That’s the challenge: \nthe mother’s immune system needs to protect both her and the fetus, \nbut can’t act as it usually does. What happens is not as simple \nas decreasing the immune response. Instead, it’s a complex interaction \nwe’re just beginning to understand, involving many different types \nof immune cells— some of which seem to protect the fetus \nfrom attack by other immune cells. The body also creates an antibacterial \nplug made of mucus on the cervix, which keeps germs away \nand stays sealed until labor. As a pregnancy progresses, the uterus expands upward and outward \nwith the growing fetus. To make room, hormones \ncalled progesterone and relaxin signal muscles to loosen. The muscles that propel food and waste \nthrough the digestive tract also loosen, which makes them sluggish, causing constipation as passage \nthrough the tract slows down. Loosened muscles \nat the top of the stomach might allow acid to escape \ninto the esophagus and throat, causing heartburn and reflux. These changes can worsen morning sickness, which is caused in part by hormone HCG— \nand can also happen at other times of day. As the uterus grows, \nit pushes on the diaphragm, the muscle that expands and contracts \nthe chest with each breath. This limits the diaphragm’s range. To compensate, the hormone progesterone \nacts as a respiratory stimulant, making the pregnant woman breathe \nfaster so both she and the baby can both get enough oxygen \nwith less lung capacity. This all may leave the pregnant woman \nfeeling short of breath. Meanwhile, the kidneys \nmake more erythropoietin, a hormone that increases \nred blood cell production. The kidneys also keep extra water and salt\nrather than filtering it out into urine to build up the volume of the blood. A pregnant woman’s blood volume \nincreases by 50% or more. But it’s also a bit diluted, because it only has 25% \nmore red blood cells. Usually, the body makes blood cells \nusing iron from our food. But during pregnancy, the fetus \nis also building its own blood supply from nutrients in the mother’s food— leaving less iron and other nutrients \nfor the mother. The heart has to work extra hard \nto pump all this blood through the body and placenta. A pregnant woman’s heart rate increases, but we don’t fully understand how blood \npressure changes in a healthy pregnancy— an important area of research, because some of the most serious \ncomplications are related to the heart \nand blood pressure. The expanding uterus may press on veins— causing fluid buildup \nin the legs and feet. If it presses on a large vein \ncalled the inferior vena cava, it might interfere with blood \nreturning to the heart, causing a dizzying drop in blood pressure \nafter standing for too long. Some of these changes start \nto reverse even before birth. Shortly before delivery, \nthe fetus drops down, decreasing the pressure on the diaphragm and allowing the pregnant woman \nto take deeper breaths. During labor and birth, much of the extra fluid in the body \nis lost when the water breaks. The uterus shrinks back down \nin the weeks after birth. Like the rest of the body, \npregnancy affects the brain— but its effects here are some \nof the least understood. Recent studies show differences \nin brain scans after pregnancy and early parenting, and suggest that these changes \nare adaptive. That means they could help \nwith parenting skills, such as an increased ability to read \nfacial cues since babies can’t talk. The lack of information about pregnancy’s \neffects on the brain highlights a general truth: historically, \nalmost all the research around pregnancy has focused on the fetus, \nrather than pregnant women. Experiences of pregnancy vary widely, both within the range \nof healthy pregnancies and due to complicating health conditions—\nnew research will help us understand why, and develop effective treatments \nwhere necessary. In the meantime, \nevery pregnancy is different, and it’s important to consult a doctor \nwith any specific questions. Today, we’re turning an exciting corner, as more research is devoted \nto the astounding biology of pregnancy. "

        "text": "Your eyes get heavy and gradually... \nclose... But wait! It’s only lunchtime\nand you still have so much to do. Would taking a nap help?\nOr would it derail your day? Our sleep, both at night and in naps, is made up of approximately 90 minute\nsleep cycles with four stages each. A nap can last anywhere from five minutes\nto three hours, so it can include full sleep cycles\nor just a few stages. As you fall asleep, you enter Stage 1:\nthe first two to five minutes of sleep. Stage 2 comes next, for about 30 minutes. In Stage 2, body temperature drops, \nmuscles relax, and breathing and heart rate \nbecome more regular. Your neurons start to fire in unison, creating waves of activity \nthat sweep across the cortex, punctuated by rapid bursts \nof neural activity called sleep spindles. As you enter Stage 3,\nor slow wave sleep, the rolling waves increase as your neurons\nfire in coordination. This phase lasts about 20 to 30 minutes\nand is where your deepest sleep occurs. Then, you enter REM sleep, which lasts\nabout 10 to 20 minutes in a nap. In REM, the brain becomes more active,\nmore like your brain activity while awake. The end of REM signals \nthe completion of a sleep cycle. OK, but will a nap make you feel better? Well, that depends on a few things— especially what stages of sleep\nthe nap includes. Take a 30 minute nap, \nwhich consists mainly of Stage 2 sleep. Stage 2 sleep is associated \nwith long-term potentiation, a process that's thought to strengthen\nthe synapses between neurons, which is essential for learning. A 20 to 30 minute nap stops short\nof Stage 3′s deep sleep, making it relatively easy to wake up from. A 30 to 60 minute nap, meanwhile,\nhas the benefits of Stage 2 sleep and also takes you into the deeper sleep \nof Stage 3. During Stage 3, multiple brain areas\nwork together to transfer information from short-term memory storage\nto long-term storage, stabilizing and strengthening \nlong-term memory by coupling sleep spindles \nwith slow waves. Stage 3 is the most difficult stage \nto wake up from. So while a 30 to 60 minute nap\ncan have cognitive benefits, those benefits often don’t kick in until \nabout 15 minutes after waking up. 60 to 90 minute naps enter the REM stage. While in REM, the prefrontal cortex, which is largely responsible \nfor inhibition and cognitive control, becomes much less active. Meanwhile, the amygdala \nand cingulate cortex, regions associated with emotion \nand motivation, are highly active. Researchers have posited that \nthe combination of these things leads to bizarre dreams during REM sleep: the decrease in inhibition and cognitive\ncontrol might lead to wild associations— and, thanks to the amygdala \nand cingulate cortex activity, those associations can be \nbetween emotionally charged topics. Some researchers think this stage might\nhelp us make innovative connections between ideas upon waking. Because the brain activity during\nREM is closer to waking, it may be easier to wake up from REM \nthan Stage 3, even though the nap is longer. The time of day also matters. Our need for deep Stage 3 sleep \nprogressively increases throughout the day. So if you nap later, you may rob yourself of the sleep pressure\nneeded to go to sleep at night. This doesn't happen for REM sleep. Longer periods of REM occur\nduring morning hours, so morning naps are dominated by REM, midday naps have about equal parts\nof REM and deep sleep, and evening naps contain more deep sleep. On top of all this, it seems \nthat we’re just about evenly split between nappers and non-nappers. Nappers consistently show\ncognitive benefits from napping, but non-nappers may not. Researchers think this could be \nbecause nappers are able to stay in a lighter sleep\nand move through sleep stages more easily. Meanwhile, non-nappers may experience\nmore deep sleep while napping, making them groggy afterward. So will a nap help? Well, there’s only one way to find out... "

But according to the Chinese zodiac,\nor shēngxiào, it's your shǔxiàng, meaning the animal\nassigned to your birth year. And of the many myths explaining\nthese animal signs and their arrangement, the most enduring one is \nthat of the Great Race. As the story goes, Yù Dì, or Jade Emperor,\nRuler of the Heavens, wanted to devise a way to measure time,\nso he organized a race. The first twelve animals to make it\nacross the river would earn a spot on the zodiac calendar\nin the order they arrived. The rat rose with the sun\nto get an early start, but on the way to the river, he met the horse, the tiger, and the ox. Because the rat was small\nand couldn't swim very well, he asked the bigger animals for help. While the tiger and horse refused, the kind-hearted ox agreed\nto carry the rat across. Yet, just as they were about\nto reach the other side, the rat jumped off the ox's head\nand secured first place. The ox came in second, with the powerful tiger right behind him. The rabbit, \ntoo small to battle the current, nimbly hopped across stones and logs\nto come in fourth. Next came the dragon,\nwho could have flown directly across, but stopped to help some creatures\nshe had encountered on the way. After her came the horse,\ngalloping across the river. But just as she got across,\nthe snake slithered by. The startled horse reared back,\nletting the snake sneak into sixth place. The Jade Emperor looked out at the river and spotted the sheep, the monkey,\nand the rooster all atop a raft, working together to push it \nthrough the weeds. When they made it across, the trio agreed to give eighth place\nto the sheep, who had been the most comforting\nand harmonious of them, followed by the monkey and the rooster. Next came the dog, \nscrambling onto the shore. He was a great swimmer, but frolicked in the water for so long\nthat he only managed to come in eleventh. The final spot was claimed by the pig, who had gotten hungry and stopped\nto eat and nap before finally waddling \nacross the finish line. And so, each year is associated with one\nof the animals in this order, with the cycle starting over\nevery 60 years. Why 60 and not twelve? Well, the traditional Chinese calendar\nis made up of two overlapping systems. The animals of the zodiac are associated\nwith what's called the Twelve Earthly Branches, or shí'èrzhī. Another system, the Ten Heavenly Stems,\nor tiāngān, is linked with the five classical elements of metal, xīn, wood, mù, water, shuǐ, fire, huǒ, and earth, tǔ. Each element is assigned yīn or yáng, creating a ten-year cycle. When the twelve animals\nof the Earthly Branches are matched with the five elements plus the yīn or the yáng\nof the Heavenly Stems, it creates 60 years \nof different combinations, known as a sexagenary cycle, or gānzhī. So someone born in 1980 would have\nthe sign of yáng metal monkey, while someone born in 2007 \nwould be yīn fire pig. In fact, you can also have an inner animal\nbased on your birth month, a true animal based on your birth date, and a secret animal based on \nyour birth hour. It was the great race \nthat supposedly determined which animals were enshrined \nin the Chinese zodiac, but as the system spread through Asia, other cultures made changes\nto reflect their communities. So if you consult the Vietnamese zodiac, you may discover that you're a cat,\nnot a rabbit, and if you're in Thailand, a mythical snake called a Naga\nreplaces the dragon. So whether or not you place stock \nin what the zodiac says about you as an individual, it certainly reveals much about\nthe culture it comes from. "

        "text": "You're lifting weights. The first time feels easy, but each lift takes more and more effort \nuntil you can’t continue. Inside your arms, the muscles responsible for the lifting\nhave become unable to contract. Why do our muscles get fatigued? We often blame lactic acid \nor running out of energy, but these factors alone don’t account \nfor muscle fatigue. There’s another major contributor: the muscle’s ability to respond \nto signals from the brain. To understand the roots of muscle fatigue, it helps to know how a muscle contracts \nin response to a signal from a nerve. These signals travel from the brain to the\nmuscles in a fraction of a second via long, thin cells called motor neurons. The motor neuron and the muscle cell \nare separated by a tiny gap, and the exchange of particles \nacross this gap enables the contraction. On one side of the gap, the motor neuron contains a \nneurotransmitter called acetylcholine. On the other side, charged particles, or ions, line the muscle cell’s membrane: potassium on the inside, \nand sodium on the outside. In response to a signal from the brain, the motor neuron releases acetylcholine, which triggers pores on the muscle \ncell membrane to open. Sodium flows in, and potassium flows out. The flux of these charged particles \nis a crucial step for muscle contraction: the change in charge creates an electrical\nsignal called an action potential that spreads through the muscle cell, stimulating the release of calcium\nthat’s stored inside it. This flood of calcium causes \nthe muscle to contract by enabling proteins buried in the muscle \nfibers to lock together and ratchet towards each other, pulling the muscle tight. The energy used to power the contraction\ncomes from a molecule called ATP. ATP also helps pump the ions back \nacross the membrane afterward, resetting the balance of sodium \nand potassium on either side. This whole process repeats \nevery time a muscle contracts. With each contraction, energy in the form of ATP gets used up, waste products like lactic \nacid are generated, and some ions drift away from the muscle’s\ncell membrane, leaving a smaller and \nsmaller group behind. Though muscle cells use up ATP as they \ncontract repeatedly, they are always making more, so most of the time even heavily fatigued muscles still \nhave not depleted this energy source. And though many waste products are acidic, fatigued muscles still maintain pH \nwithin normal limits, indicating that the tissue is effectively\nclearing these wastes. But eventually, over the course of \nrepeated contractions there may not be sufficient concentrations\nof potassium, sodium or calcium ions immediately available near \nthe muscle cell membrane to reset the system properly. So even if the brain sends a signal, the muscle cell can’t generate the action\npotential necessary to contract. Even when ions like sodium, \npotassium or calcium are depleted in or around the muscle cell, these ions are plentiful \nelsewhere in the body. With a little time, they will flow back to the areas \nwhere they’re needed, sometimes with the help of active sodium\nand potassium pumps. So if you pause and rest, muscle fatigue will subside as these ions\nreplenish throughout the muscle. The more regularly you exercise, the longer it takes for muscle fatigue \nto set in each time. That’s because the stronger you are, the fewer times this cycle of nerve signal\nfrom the brain to contraction in the muscle\nhas to be repeated to lift a certain amount of weight. Fewer cycles means slower ion depletion, so as your physical fitness improves, you can exercise for longer \nat the same intensity. Many muscles grow with exercise, and larger muscles also \nhave bigger stores of ATP and a higher capacity to clear waste, pushing fatigue even \nfarther into the future. "

But unlike skin and bones, the heart \nhas a limited ability to repair itself. So if this organ is severely damaged, there’s often only one medical solution:\nreplacing it. Today, nearly 3,500 heart transplants \nare performed each year in a complex and intricate procedure \nwith no room for error. The process begins \nby testing potential recipients to ensure they’re healthy enough \nfor this demanding operation. Doctors are especially concerned with\nidentifying immunocompromising illnesses or any other conditions that could\ncompromise a patient's chance of survival. The next step is to match an eligible\nrecipient with a heart donor. Donors are often comatose patients\nwith no chance of being resuscitated or victims of a fatal event \nwhose hearts are still healthy. In both cases, these patients need \nto be registered as an organ donor or have their families give consent. And even when a heart is available, surgeons can’t just pair any donor \nwith any recipient. The recipient’s immune system will view\na transplanted heart as a foreign organism \nthat must be attacked. So doctors need to match recipients \nwith donors that share their blood type and have similar antigens. If a match can be made, \nthe surgery can begin. Once the donor's heart is\nconfirmed to be healthy, the organ is immersed in an ice slush and injected with a solution\nto induce cardiac arrest. These treatments stop the heart \nfrom pumping to ensure it can be removed cleanly. Surgeons then place the organ \nin a mix of cold saline and preservation solution. This is when the clock starts. Disconnected from its blood supply, the heart’s cells start taking on damage\nfrom lack of oxygen. The organ will only remain viable \noutside the body for a few hours, so it needs to reach its recipient\nas fast as possible. Once the heart arrives, the recipient\nis put under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes an incision\ndown the length of the chest, cutting through the breastbone \nto separate the rib cage and expose the heart. To keep blood flowing\nwhile they remove the damaged organ, surgeons use a cardiopulmonary\nbypass machine. This takes over the heart's job, generating enough force to push blood\nthrough the patient's circulatory system. After the old heart is removed, the surgeon begins sewing\nthe donor heart into place. This is an incredibly precise process,\nwhere each blood vessel and artery must be carefully attached to avoid leaks. The procedure can last several hours, potentially longer if there’s scar tissue \nfrom previous surgeries. Once it’s finished, \nthe bypass machine is turned off and blood is allowed\nto flow into the aorta. Doctors carefully monitor the new heart\nto ensure it’s beating on its own before sewing the recipient back up. Even after the procedure is complete,\nthere's still work to be done. Surgeons are unable to directly\nconnect the heart to the recipient’s nervous system, and it can take years for the body\nto fully innervate the new organ. During this period, the transplanted organ\nhas a higher resting heart rate and risk of stroke, making exercise\ndifficult and dangerous. And since it’s incredibly rare\nto find a perfect match between donor and recipient, the immune system will also\nhave some response to the new heart. Immunosuppressive drugs can help\nmanage the risk of rejection, but they also leave patients open\nto contracting dangerous infections. It requires constant monitoring\nand testing to balance these two concerns. Despite these challenges, about 70%\nof heart transplant recipients survive for at least five years\nafter the operation, and just over 20% live another 20 years. So when this procedure is successful,\nit's truly lifesaving. Unfortunately, people in developing\ncountries are often unable to access this surgery, and many viable hearts can’t be donated\ndue to legal and regulatory issues. Thousands of people remain\non waiting lists, and many are never able\nto find a suitable donor. "

        "text": "While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan \nstumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons\nunderwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match\nfor kidney donation, the test showed that two of them\nweren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, \nher doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something \neven more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second \ngenome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had \na completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged \nto her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, \nwhere an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam\nof three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have \ntwo-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible\nsigns of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,\nfrom a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus \nand a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells \nin the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able \nto develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system \nis suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells \nwith the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body \nfor years or even decades without being destroyed\nby her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,\nand found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her\nliver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired \nher second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy\nwith her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some \nfetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus \ndeveloped an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized\nboth genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells\nwith the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was\ncomposed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,\nand even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all\nwith the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue\nin her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be \nno way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children\nended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing \ndetermined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%\nof the father’s sperm carried a second genome \nfrom an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge \nour perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases\nof chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic\ncodes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births\nstarted out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people\nwith two genomes— and many more lessons to learn\nabout the genes that make us who we are. "

        "text": "10,000 years ago, a deadly virus arose in northeastern Africa. The virus spread through the air, attacking the skin cells, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes of its victims. The unlucky infected developed fevers, vomiting, and rashes. 30% of infected people died during the second week of infection. Survivors bore scars and scabs for the rest of their lives. Smallpox had arrived. In 1350 B.C., the first smallpox epidemics hit during the Egypt-Hittite war. Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox to the Hittites, which killed their king and devastated his civilization. Insidiously, smallpox made its way around the world via Egyptian merchants, then through the Arab world with the Crusades, and all the way to the Americas with the Spanish and Portuguese conquests. Since then, it has killed billions of people with an estimated 300 to 500 million people killed in the 20th century alone. But smallpox is not unbeatable. In fact, the fall of smallpox started long before modern medicine. It began all the way back in 1022 A.D. According to a small book, called \"The Correct Treatment of Small Pox,\" a Buddhist nun living in a famous mountain named O Mei Shan in the southern providence of Sichuan would grind up smallpox scabs and blow the powder into nostrils of healthy people. She did this after noticing that those who managed to survive smallpox never got it again, and her odd treatment worked. The procedure, called variolation, slowly evolved and by the 1700's, doctors were taking material from sores and putting them into healthy people through four or five scratches on the arm. This worked pretty well as inoculated people would not get reinfected, but it wasn't foolproof. Up to three percent of people would still die after being exposed to the puss. It wasn't until English physician Edward Jenner noticed something interesting about dairy maids that we got our modern solution. At age 13, while Jenner was apprentice to a country surgeon and apothecary in Sodbury, near Bristol, he heard a dairy maid say, \"I shall never have smallpox, for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly, pockmarked face.\" Cowpox is a skin disease that resembles smallpox and infects cows. Later on, as a physician, he realized that she was right, women who got cowpox didn't develop the deadly smallpox. Smallpox and cowpox viruses are from the same family. But when a virus infects an unfamiliar host, in this case cowpox infecting a human, it is less virulent, so Jenner decided to test whether the cowpox virus could be used to protect against smallpox. In May 1796, Jenner found a young dairy maid, Sarah Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand and arm caught from the utters of a cow named Blossom. Using matter from her pustules, he inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener. After a few days of fever and discomfort, the boy seemed to recover. Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with matter from a fresh smallpox lesion. No disease developed, and Jenner concluded that protection was complete. His plan had worked. Jenner later used the cowpox virus in several other people and challenged them repeatedly with smallpox, proving that they were immune to the disease. With this procedure, Jenner invented the smallpox vaccination. Unlike variolation, which used actual smallpox virus to try to protect people, vaccination used the far less dangerous cowpox virus. The medical establishment, cautious then as now, deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. But eventually vaccination was gradually accepted and variolation became prohibited\nin England in 1840. After large vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the World Health Organization certified smallpox's eradication in 1979. Jenner is forever remembered as the father of immunology, but let's not forget the Buddhist nun, dairy maid Sarah Nelmes, \nand James Phipps, all heroes in this great adventure of vaccination who helped eradicate smallpox.

        "text": "In the 1950s, \nthe discovery of two new drugs sparked what would become a multibillion \ndollar market for antidepressants. Neither drug was intended \nto treat depression at all— in fact, at the time, many doctors \nand scientists believed psychotherapy was the only approach \nto treating depression. The decades-long journey of discovery\nthat followed revolutionized our understanding \nof depression— and raised questions \nwe hadn’t considered before. One of those first two antidepressant\ndrugs was ipronaizid, which was intended to treat tuberculosis. In a 1952 trial, \nit not only treated tuberculosis, it also improved the moods of patients who had previously been diagnosed \nwith depression. In 1956, a Swiss clinician observed \na similar effect when running a trial for imipramine, \na drug for allergic reactions. Both drugs affected a class \nof neurotransmitters called monoamines. The discovery of these \nantidepressant drugs gave rise \nto the chemical imbalance theory, the idea that depression is caused\nby having insufficient monoamines in the brain’s synapses. Ipronaizid, imipramine, \nand other drugs like them were thought to restore that balance by increasing the availability \nof monoamines in the brain. These drugs targeted several\ndifferent monoamines, each of which acted on a wide range\nof receptors in the brain. This often meant a lot of side effects, including headaches, grogginess, \nand cognitive impairments including difficulty with memory, \nthinking, and judgment. Hoping to make the drugs more targeted \nand reduce side effects, scientists began studying existing \nantidepressants to figure out which specific monoamines \nwere most associated with improvements in depression. In the 1970s, several different\nresearchers converged on an answer: the most effective antidepressants \nall seemed to act on one monoamine called serotonin. This discovery led to the production\nof fluoxetine, or Prozac, in 1988. It was the first of a new class of drugs called Selective Serotonin \nReuptake Inhibitors, or SSRI’s, which block the reabsorption of serotonin,\nleaving more available in the brain. Prozac worked well \nand had fewer side effects than older, less targeted antidepressants. The makers of Prozac also worked \nto market the drug by raising awareness \nof the dangers of depression to both the public \nand the medical community. More people came to see depression \nas a disease caused by mechanisms beyond \nan individual’s control, which reduced the culture of blame \nand stigmatization surrounding depression, and more people sought help. In the 1990s, the number of people being\ntreated for depression skyrocketed. Psychotherapy and other treatments\nfell by the wayside, and most people were treated \nsolely with antidepressant drugs. Since then, we’ve developed a more nuanced\nview of how to treat depression— and of what causes it. Not everyone with depression responds \nto SSRIs like Prozac— some respond better to drugs \nthat act on other neurotransmitters, or don't respond to medication at all. For many, a combination \nof psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs is more effective than either alone. We’re also not sure why antidepressants\nwork the way they do: they change monoamine levels within\na few hours of taking the medication, but patients usually don’t feel\nthe benefit until weeks later. And after they stop \ntaking antidepressants, some patients never experience \ndepression again, while others relapse. We now recognize that we don’t\nknow what causes depression, or why anti-depressants work. The chemical imbalance theory \nis at best an incomplete explanation. It can’t be a coincidence that almost all\nthe antidepressants happen to act on serotonin, but that doesn’t mean serotonin deficiency\nis the cause of depression. If that sounds odd, \nconsider a more straightforward example: steroid creams can treat rashes\ncaused by poison ivy— the fact that they work doesn’t mean\nsteroid deficiency was the cause of the rash. We still have a ways to go in terms \nof understanding this disease. Fortunately, in the meantime, \nwe have effective tools to treat it. "

        "text": "In 2009, two researchers ran \na simple experiment. They took everything we know \nabout our solar system and calculated where every planet would be\nup to 5 billion years in the future. To do so they ran over 2,000 \nnumerical simulations with the same exact initial conditions\nexcept for one difference: the distance between Mercury and the Sun,\nmodified by less than a millimeter from one simulation to the next. Shockingly, in about 1 percent \nof their simulations, Mercury’s orbit changed so drastically \nthat it could plunge into the Sun or collide with Venus. Worse yet, in one simulation it destabilized\nthe entire inner solar system. This was no error; \nthe astonishing variety in results reveals the truth that our solar system \nmay be much less stable than it seems. Astrophysicists refer to this astonishing\nproperty of gravitational systems as the n-body problem. While we have equations \nthat can completely predict the motions of two gravitating masses, our analytical tools fall short \nwhen faced with more populated systems. It’s actually impossible to write down\nall the terms of a general formula that can exactly describe the motion\nof three or more gravitating objects. Why? The issue lies in how many unknown\nvariables an n-body system contains. Thanks to Isaac Newton, \nwe can write a set of equations to describe the gravitational force \nacting between bodies. However, when trying to find a general \nsolution for the unknown variables in these equations, we’re faced with \na mathematical constraint: for each unknown, \nthere must be at least one equation that independently describes it. Initially, a two-body system appears \nto have more unknown variables for position and velocity \nthan equations of motion. However, there’s a trick: consider the relative position \nand velocity of the two bodies with respect to the center \nof gravity of the system. This reduces the number of unknowns\nand leaves us with a solvable system. With three or more orbiting objects \nin the picture, everything gets messier. Even with the same mathematical trick \nof considering relative motions, we’re left with more unknowns \nthan equations describing them. There are simply too many variables\nfor this system of equations to be untangled into a general solution. But what does it actually look like \nfor objects in our universe to move according to analytically \nunsolvable equations of motion? A system of three stars—\nlike Alpha Centauri— could come crashing\ninto one another or, more likely, some might get flung out of orbit \nafter a long time of apparent stability. Other than a few highly improbable \nstable configurations, almost every possible case \nis unpredictable on long timescales. Each has an astronomically large range\nof potential outcomes, dependent on the tiniest of differences\nin position and velocity. This behaviour is known \nas chaotic by physicists, and is an important characteristic \nof n-body systems. Such a system is still deterministic—\nmeaning there’s nothing random about it. If multiple systems start \nfrom the exact same conditions, they’ll always reach the same result. But give one a little shove at the start,\nand all bets are off. That’s clearly relevant \nfor human space missions, when complicated orbits need \nto be calculated with great precision. Thankfully, continuous advancements\nin computer simulations offer a number of ways\nto avoid catastrophe. By approximating the solutions \nwith increasingly powerful processors, we can more confidently predict the motion\nof n-body systems on long time-scales. And if one body in a group \nof three is so light it exerts no significant force \non the other two, the system behaves, with very good \napproximation, as a two-body system. This approach is known \nas the “restricted three-body problem.” It proves extremely useful \nin describing, for example, an asteroid in the Earth-Sun \ngravitational field, or a small planet in the field \nof a black hole and a star. As for our solar system, \nyou’ll be happy to hear that we can have reasonable confidence\nin its stability for at least the next \nseveral hundred million years. Though if another star, launched from across the galaxy, \nis on its way to us, all bets are off. "

        "text": "Without water, a human can only\nsurvive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient\nthat it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive\nboth the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels\nof radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures\non Earth, even if it does look more like\na chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives\nall the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,\nalso known as the water bear, get around this restriction\nwith a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning\nlife without water. And however extraordinary,\ntardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals \ncan all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through \nsomething called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs\ninside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water\nbecomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells\nto replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are\nsensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these\nmolecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,\nthe matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, \nfunctional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also\ntolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point\nof water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades \nare extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their\norigin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution \nhas given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others\nyet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,\nthey exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,\nincluding Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes\nincluding deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades\nin the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little\npatience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out\nwhether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,\nand other creatures, stabilize their sensitive \nbiological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge\nto help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that \ncan cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure \nto the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about\nthe environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even\nhelp us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much\nless hospitable than our own? "

Neighboring countries' monarchs feared\nthey would share the fate of Louis XVI, and attacked the New Republic, while at home, extremism and mistrust\nbetween factions lead to bloodshed. In the midst of all this conflict, a powerful figure emerged \nto take charge of France. But did he save the revolution\nor destroy it? \"Order, order, who's the defendant today?\nI don't see anyone.\" \"Your Honor, this is Napoléon Bonaparte, the tyrant who invaded \nnearly all of Europe to compensate for his personal \nstature-based insecurities.\" \"Actually, Napoléon was \nat least average height for his time. The idea that he was short comes\nonly from British wartime propaganda. And he was no tyrant. He was safeguarding the young Republic\nfrom being crushed by the European monarchies.\" \"By overthrowing its government\nand seizing power himself?\" \"Your Honor, as a young and successful\nmilitary officer, Napoléon fully supported \nthe French Revolution, and its ideals of liberty, equality,\nand fraternity. But the revolutionaries were incapable\nof real leadership. Robespierre and the Jacobins\nwho first came to power unleashed a reign of terror\non the population, with their anti-Catholic extremism and nonstop executions of everyone\nwho disagreed with them. And The Directory that replaced them\nwas an unstable and incompetent oligarchy. They needed a strong leader who could\ngovern wisely and justly.\" \"So, France went through \nthat whole revolution just to end up with \nanother all-powerful ruler?\" \"Not quite. Napoléon's new powers were derived\nfrom the constitution that was approved by a popular vote\nin the Consulate.\" \"Ha! The constitution was practically dictated\nat gunpoint in a military coup, and the public only accepted the tyrant because they were tired \nof constant civil war.\" \"Be that as it may, Napoléon introduced a new constitution\nand a legal code that kept some of the most important\nachievements of the revolution in tact: freedom of religion abolition of hereditary privilege, and equality before the law for all men.\" \"All men, indeed. He deprived women of the rights\nthat the revolution had given them and even reinstated slavery\nin the French colonies. Haiti is still recovering from \nthe consequences centuries later. What kind of equality is that?\" \"The only kind that could be stably\nmaintained at the time, and still far ahead of France's neighbors.\" \"Speaking of neighbors, what was with\nall the invasions?\" \"Great question, Your Honor.\" \"Which invasions are we talking about? It was the neighboring empires\nwho had invaded France trying to restore the monarchy, and prevent the spread of liberty\nacross Europe, twice by the time Napoléon took charge. Having defended France as a soldier\nand a general in those wars, he knew that the best defense\nis a good offense.\" \"An offense against the entire continent? Peace was secured by 1802, and other European powers recognized\nthe new French Regime. But Bonaparte couldn't rest unless \nhe had control of the whole continent, and all he knew was fighting. He tried to enforce a European-wide\nblockade of Britain, invaded any country that didn't comply, and launched more wars \nto hold onto his gains. And what was the result? Millions dead all over the continent, and the whole \ninternational order shattered.\" \"You forgot the other result: the spread of democratic \nand liberal ideals across Europe. It was thanks to Napoléon that\nthe continent was reshaped from a chaotic patchwork of fragmented\nfeudal and religious territories into efficient, modern, \nand secular nation states where the people held more power\nand rights than ever before.\" \"Should we also thank him\nfor the rise of nationalism and the massive increase in army sizes? You can see how well that turned out\na century later.\" \"So what would European history have been\nlike if it weren't for Napoléon?\" \"Unimaginably better/worse.\" Napoléon seemingly unstoppable momentum\nwould die in the Russian winter snows, along with most of his army. But even after being deposed\nand exiled, he refused to give up, escaping from his prison and launching\na bold attempt at restoring his empire before being defeated for the second\nand final time. Bonaparte was \na ruler full of contradictions, defending a popular revolution\nby imposing absolute dictatorship, and spreading liberal ideals\nthrough imperial wars, and though he never achieved his dream\nof conquering Europe, he undoubtedly left his mark on it,\nfor better or for worse.

He was creating a new defense \nsystem for King Minos, who wanted fewer intruders on his \nisland kingdom of Crete. But mortal guards and ordinary \nweapons wouldn’t suffice, so the visionary god devised an \nindomitable new defender. In the fires of his forge, Hephaestus cast his invention in \nthe shape of a giant man. Made of gleaming bronze; endowed with \nsuperhuman strength, and powered by ichor, \nthe life fluid of the gods, this automaton was unlike anything \nHephaestus had forged before. The god named his creation Talos: \nthe first robot. Three times a day, the bronze guardian \nmarched around the island's perimeter searching for interlopers. When he identified ships \napproaching the coast, he hurled massive boulders \ninto their path. If any survivors made it ashore, he would heat his metal body red-hot \nand crush victims to his chest. Talos was intended to fulfill his duties \nday after day, with no variation. But despite his robotic behavior, he possessed an internal life his victims \ncould scarcely imagine. And soon, the behemoth would encounter a ship \nof invaders that would test his mettle. The bedraggled crew of Jason, Medea, \nand the Argonauts were returning from their hard-won quest \nto retrieve the Golden Fleece. Their adventure had taken \nmany dark turns, and the weary sailors were desperate \nto rest in a safe harbor. They’d heard tales of Crete’s invulnerable\nbronze colossus, and made for a sheltered cove. But before they could even drop anchor, \nTalos spotted them. While the Argonauts cowered at the \napproach of the awesome automaton, the sorceress Medea spotted a glinting \nbolt on the robot’s ankle— and devised a clever gambit. Medea offered Talos a bargain: she claimed that she could \nmake Talos immortal in exchange for removing the bolt. Medea's promise resonated deep \nwithin his core. Unaware of his own mechanical nature, and human enough to long for \neternal life, Talos agreed. While Medea muttered incantations, \nJason removed the bolt. As Medea suspected, the bolt was a \nweak point in Hephaestus’ design. The ichor flowed out like molten lead, \ndraining Talos of his power source. The robot collapsed with \na thunderous crash, and the Argonauts were free \nto travel home. This story, first recorded in \nroughly 700 BCE, raises some familiar anxieties \nabout artificial intelligence— and even provides an ancient \nblueprint for science fiction. But according to historians, ancient \nrobots were more than just myths. By the 4th century BCE, Greek engineers began making \nactual automatons including robotic servants and \nflying models of birds. None of these creations were \nas famous as Talos, who appeared on Greek coins, vase \npaintings, public frescoes, and in theatrical performances. Even 2,500 years ago, Greeks had already begun to investigate \nthe uncertain line between human and machine. And like many modern myths about \nartificial intelligence, Talos’ tale is as much about his robotic \nheart as it is about his robotic brain. Illustrating the demise of Talos on a \nvase of the fifth century BCE, one painter captured the dying \nautomaton’s despair with a tear rolling down his bronze cheek. "

        "text": "Approximately 7 million people around the \nworld die from heart attacks every year, and cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other\nproblems like strokes, is the world's leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen, and during a heart attack,\nit can't get enough. Fatty deposits, or plaques, develop on the walls \nof our coronary arteries. Those are the vessels that supply\noxygenated blood to the heart. These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky, hardened, or enflamed. Eventually, the plaques can turn\ninto blockages. If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it\nin minutes, and a partially closed artery\ncan become completely blocked. Blood flow is cut off \nto the cardiac muscle and the oxygen-starved cells start to die\nwithin several minutes. This is a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Things can rapidly deteriorate\nin the absence of treatment. The injured muscle may not be able\nto pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown off. In the worst case scenario,\na heart attack can cause sudden death. And how do you know that someone\nis having a heart attack? The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen-deprived \nheart muscle. Patients describe it as crushing\nor vice-like. It can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen. But it's not always as sudden and dramatic\nas it is in the movies. Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath. Symptoms may be less prominent\nin women and the elderly. For them, weakness and tiredness\nmay be the main signal. And surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes,\nwhich affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent. If you think that someone might be \nhaving a heart attack, the most important thing \nis to respond quickly. If you have access to emergency medical\nservices, call them. They're the fastest way \nto get to a hospital. Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin, \nwhich opens up the artery, can help keep the heart attack\nfrom getting worse. In the emergency room, \ndoctors can diagnose a heart attack. They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's \nelectrical activity and a blood test to assess \nheart muscle damage. The patient is then taken to a high-tech\ncardiac suite where tests are done \nto locate the blockages. Cardiologists can reopen \nthe blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon\nin a procedure called an angioplasty. Frequently, they also insert a metal\nor polymer stent that will hold the artery open. More extensive blockages might require\ncoronary artery bypass surgery. Using a piece of vein or artery\nfrom another part of the body, heart surgeons can reroute blood flow\naround the blockage. These procedures reestablish circulation\nto the cardiac muscle, restoring heart function. Heart attack treatment is advancing, but prevention is vital. Genetics and lifestyle factors\nboth affect your risk. And the good news is that you can\nchange your lifestyle. Exercise, a healthy diet,\nand weight loss all lower the risk of heart attacks, whether you've had one before or not. Doctors recommend exercising\na few times a week, doing both aerobic activity\nand strength training. A heart-healthy diet is low\nin sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease. So what should you eat? Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains and nuts like walnuts\nand almonds all seem to be beneficial. A good diet and exercise plan can also\nkeep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower \nyour heart attack risk as well. And of course, medications can also\nhelp prevent heart attacks. Doctors often prescribe low-dose\naspirin, for example, particularly for patients who've\nalready had a heart attack and for those known to be\nat high risk. And drugs that help manage risk factors, like high blood pressure, cholesterol,\nand diabetes, will make heart attacks less likely, too. Heart attacks may be common, \nbut they don't have to be inevitable. A healthy diet, avoiding tobacco use, staying fit, and enjoying plenty of sleep\nand lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure\nyour body's most important muscle keeps on beating. "

        "text": "We hear about calories all the time. How many calories are in this cookie? How many are burned by 100 jumping jacks, or long distance running, or fidgeting? But what is a calorie, really,\nand how many of them do we actually need? Calories are a way of keeping track\nof the body's energy budget. A healthy balance occurs when we put in\nabout as much energy as we lose. If we consistently put more energy\ninto our bodies than we burn, the excess will gradually \nbe stored as fat in our cells, and we'll gain weight. If we burn off more energy \nthan we replenish, we'll lose weight. So we have to be able \nto measure the energy we consume and use, and we do so with a unit \ncalled the calorie. One calorie, the kind we measure in food,\nalso called a large calorie, is defined as the amount of energy it would take to raise the temperature\nof one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. Everything we consume has a calorie count, a measure of how much energy \nthe item stores in its chemical bonds. The average pizza slice has 272 calories, there are about 78 in a piece of bread, and an apple has about 52. That energy is released during digestion, and stored in other molecules that can be broken down to provide energy\nwhen the body needs it. It's used in three ways: about 10% enables digestion, about 20% fuels physical activity, and the biggest chunk, around 70%, supports the basic functions \nof our organs and tissues. That third usage corresponds to \nyour basal metabolic rate, a number of calories \nyou would need to survive if you weren't eating or moving around. Add in some physical activity \nand digestion, and you arrive at the official guidelines for how many calories \nthe average person requires each day: 2000 for women and 2500 for men. Those estimates are based on factors like average weight, physical activity \nand muscle mass. So does that mean everyone\nshould shoot for around 2000 calories? Not necessarily. If you're doing \nan energy guzzling activity, like cycling the Tour de France, your body could use \nup to 9000 calories per day. Pregnancy requires \nslightly more calories than usual, and elderly people typically \nhave a slower metabolic rate, energy is burned more gradually,\nso less is needed. Here's something else you should know\nbefore you start counting calories. The calorie counts on nutrition labels\nmeasure how much energy the food contains, not how much energy \nyou can actually get out of it. Fibrous foods like celery and whole wheat\ntake more energy to digest, so you'd actually wind up with less energy\nfrom a 100 calorie serving of celery than a 100 calorie serving \nof potato chips. Not to mention the fact that some foods\noffer nutrients like protein and vitamins, while others provide \nfar less nutritional value. Eating too many of those foods could leave you overweight \nand malnourished. And even with the exact same food, different people might not \nget the same number of calories. Variations in things like enzyme levels, gut bacteria, and even intestine length, means that every individual's ability\nto extract energy from food is a little different. So a calorie is a useful energy measure, but to work out exactly \nhow many of them each of us requires we need to factor in things like exercise, food type, and our body's ability to process energy. Good luck finding all of that\non a nutrition label. "

        "text": "15th century Europeans believed \nthey had hit upon a miracle cure: a remedy for epilepsy, hemorrhage, \nbruising, nausea, and virtually any other \nmedical ailment. This brown powder could be mixed \ninto drinks, made into salves or eaten straight up. It was known as mumia and made \nby grinding up mummified human flesh. The word \"cannibal\" dates from the \ntime of Christopher Columbus; in fact, Columbus may even have \ncoined it himself. After coming ashore on the \nisland of Guadaloupe, Columbus' initial reports back \nto the Queen of Spain described the indigenous people as \nfriendly and peaceful— though he did mention rumors of a \ngroup called the Caribs, who made violent raids and then cooked \nand ate their prisoners. In response, Queen Isabella granted \npermission to capture and enslave anyone who ate human flesh. When the island failed to produce the gold\nColumbus was looking for, he began to label anyone who resisted his \nplundering and kidnapping as a Caribe. Somewhere along the way, the word \"Carib\" \nbecame \"Canibe\" and then \"Cannibal.\" First used by colonizers to dehumanize \nindigenous people, it has since been applied to anyone \nwho eats human flesh. So the term comes from an account that \nwasn't based on hard evidence, but cannibalism does have a real and \nmuch more complex history. It has taken diverse forms— sometimes, \nas with mumia, it doesn't involved recognizable parts \nof the human body. The reasons for cannibalistic practices \nhave varied, too. Across cultures and time periods, there's \nevidence of survival cannibalism, when people living through a famine, \nsiege or ill-fated expedition had to either eat the bodies of the dead \nor starve to death themselves. But it's also been quite common \nfor cultures to normalize some form of eating human \nflesh under ordinary circumstances. Because of false accounts \nlike Columbus's, it's difficult to say exactly how common \ncultural cannibalism has been— but there are still some examples of \naccepted cannibalistic practices from within the cultures practicing them. Take the medicinal cannibalism in Europe \nduring Columbus's time. Starting in the 15th century, the demand \nfor mumia increased. At first, stolen mummies from Egypt \nsupplied the mumia craze, but soon the demand was too great to be \nsustained on Egyptian mummies alone, and opportunists stole bodies from \nEuropean cemeteries to turn into mumia. Use of mumia continued for \nhundreds of years. It was listed in the Merck index, \na popular medical encyclopedia, into the 20th century. And ground up mummies were far from \nthe only remedy made from human flesh that was common throughout Europe. Blood, in either liquid or powdered form, \nwas used to treat epilepsy, while human liver, gall stones, oil \ndistilled from human brains, and pulverized hearts were popular \nmedical concoctions. In China, the written record of socially accepted \ncannibalism goes back almost 2,000 years. One particularly common \nform of cannibalism appears to have been filial cannibalism, where adult sons and daughters would \noffer a piece of their own flesh to their parents. This was typically offered as a last-ditch\nattempt to cure a sick parent, and wasn't fatal to their offspring— it usually involved flesh from the thigh \nor, less often, a finger. Cannibalistic funerary rites are another \nform of culturally sanctioned cannibalism. Perhaps the best-known example came \nfrom the Fore people of New Guinea. Through the mid-20th century, members \nof the community would, if possible, make their funerary \npreferences known in advance, sometimes requesting that family members\ngather to consume the body after death. Tragically, though these rituals \nhonored the deceased, they also spread a deadly disease known \nas kuru through the community. Between the fictionalized stories, \nverifiable practices, and big gaps that still exist \nin our knowledge, there's no one history of cannibalism. But we do know that people have \nbeen eating each other, volunteering themselves to be eaten, and accusing others of eating \npeople for millennia. "

        "text": "Take a moment to read the following. How was that? Frustrating? Slow? What were those sentences about? They're actually a simulation of the experience of dyslexia, designed to make you decode each word. Those with dyslexia experience\nthat laborious pace every time they read. When most people think of dyslexia, they think of seeing letters\nand words backwards, like seeing \"b\" as \"d\" and vice versa, or they might think people with dyslexia see \"saw\" as \"was\". The truth is people with dyslexia see things the same way as everyone else. Dyslexia is caused by a phonological\nprocessing problem, meaning people affected by it have trouble not with seeing language but with manipulating it. For example, if you heard the word cat and then someone asked\nyou, \"Remove the 'c',\" what word would you have left? At. This can be difficult\nfor those with dyslexia. Given a word in isolation, like fantastic, students with dyslexia\nneed to break the word into parts to read it: fan, tas, tic. Time spent decoding makes it hard to keep up with peers and gain sufficient comprehension. Spelling words phonetically, like s-t-i-k for stick and f-r-e-n-s for friends is also common. These difficulties are more\nwidespread and varied than commonly imagined. Dyslexia affects up to one in five people. It occurs on a continuum. One person might have mild dyslexia while the next person has\na profound case of it. Dyslexia also runs in families. It's common to see one family member who has trouble spelling while another family member has severe difficulty decoding\neven one syllable words, like catch. The continuum and distribution of dyslexia suggests a broader\nprinciple to bear in mind as we look at how the brains\nof those with dyslexia process language. Neurodiversity is the idea that because all our brains\nshow differences in structure and function, we shouldn't be so quick to label every deviation from \"the norm\" as a pathological disorder or dismiss people living\nwith these variations as \"defective.\" People with neurobiological\nvariations like dyslexia, including such creative\nand inventive individuals as Picasso, Muhammad Ali, Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, and Cher, clearly have every capacity to be brilliant and successful in life. So, here's the special way the brains of those with dyslexia work. The brain is divided into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere is generally\nin charge of language and, ultimately, reading, while the right typically\nhandles spatial activities. fMRI studies have found that the brains of those with dyslexia rely more on the right\nhemisphere and frontal lobe than the brains of those without it. This means, when they read a word, it takes a longer trip through their brain and can get delayed in the frontal lobe. Because of this neurobiological glitch, they read with more difficulty. But those with dyslexia can physically change their brain and improve their reading with an intensive,\nmulti-sensory intervention that breaks the language down and teaches the reader to decode based on syllable types\nand spelling rules. The brains of those with dyslexia begin using the left hemisphere more efficiently while reading, and their reading improves. The intervention works because it locates dyslexia appropriately as a functional variation in the brain, which, naturally, shows\nall sorts of variations from one person to another. Neurodiversity emphasizes this spectrum of brain function in all humans and suggests that to better\nunderstand the perspectives of those around us, we should try not only to see\nthe world through their eyes but understand it through their brains.

        "text": "Two perfectly rational gingerbread men,\nCrispy and Chewy, are out strolling \nwhen they’re caught by a fox. Seeing how happy they are, \nhe decides that, instead of simply eating them, he’ll put their friendship \nto the test with a cruel dilemma. He’ll ask each gingerbread man whether\nhe’d opt to Spare or Sacrifice the other. They can discuss, but neither will know what the other\nchose until their decisions are locked in. If both choose to spare the other, the fox\nwill eat just one of each of their limbs; if one chooses to spare \nwhile the other sacrifices, the sparer will be fully eaten, while the traitor will run away\nwith all his limbs intact. Finally, if both choose to sacrifice,\nthe fox will eat 3 limbs from each. In game theory, this scenario \nis called the “Prisoner's Dilemma.” To figure out how these gingerbread men \nwill act in their perfect rationality, we can map the outcomes of each decision. The rows represent Crispy’s choices,\nand the columns are Chewy’s. Meanwhile, the numbers in each cell represent the outcomes \nof their decisions, as measured in the number \nof limbs each would keep: So do we expect their friendship \nto last the game? First, let’s consider Chewy’s options. If Crispy spares him, Chewy can run\naway scot-free by sacrificing Crispy. But if Crispy sacrifices him, Chewy can keep one of his limbs\nif he also sacrifices Crispy. No matter what Crispy decides, Chewy always experiences the best outcome\nby choosing to sacrifice his companion. The same is true for Crispy. This is the standard conclusion\nof the Prisoner's Dilemma: the two characters will\nbetray one another. Their strategy to unconditionally\nsacrifice their companion is what game theorists\ncall the “Nash Equilibrium,\" meaning that neither can gain\nby deviating from it. Crispy and Chewy act accordingly and the smug fox runs off \nwith a belly full of gingerbread, leaving the two former friends\nwith just one leg to stand on. Normally, this is where\nthe story would end, but a wizard happened to be watching\nthe whole mess unfold. He tells Crispy and Chewy that, \nas punishment for betraying each other, they’re doomed to repeat this dilemma\nfor the rest of their lives, starting with all four limbs\nat each sunrise. Now what happens? This is called an Infinite Prisoner’s \nDilemma, and it’s a literal game changer. That’s because the gingerbread men \ncan now use their future decisions as bargaining chips for the present ones. Consider this strategy: both agree \nto spare each other every day. If one ever chooses to sacrifice, the other will retaliate by choosing \n“sacrifice” for the rest of eternity. So is that enough to get these\npoor sentient baked goods to agree to cooperate? To figure that out, we have to factor\nin another consideration: the gingerbread men probably care\nabout the future less than they care about the present. In other words, they might discount how much they care about their future\nlimbs by some number, which we’ll call delta. This is similar to the idea of inflation \neroding the value of money. If delta is one half, on day one they care about day 2 limbs\nhalf as much as day 1 limbs, day 3 limbs 1 quarter as much \nas day 1 limbs, and so on. A delta of 0 means that they don’t care \nabout their future limbs at all, so they’ll repeat their initial choice\nof mutual sacrifice endlessly. But as delta approaches 1, \nthey’ll do anything possible to avoid the pain of infinite triple limb \nconsumption, which means they’ll choose\nto spare each other. At some point in between\nthey could go either way. We can find out where that point is by writing the infinite series \nthat represents each strategy, setting them equal to each other,\nand solving for delta. That yields 1/3, meaning that as long\nas Crispy and Chewy care about tomorrow at least 1/3 as much as today, it’s optimal for them \nto spare and cooperate forever. This analysis isn’t unique\nto cookies and wizards; we see it play out in real-life situations like trade negotiations\nand international politics. Rational leaders must assume \nthat the decisions they make today will impact those of their adversaries \ntomorrow. Selfishness may win out in the short-term,\nbut with the proper incentives, peaceful cooperation is not only possible,\nbut demonstrably and mathematically ideal. As for the gingerbread men, \ntheir eternity may be pretty crumby, but so long as they go out on a limb, their friendship will never \nagain be half-baked. "

        "text": "Ethanol: this molecule, made of little \nmore than a few carbon atoms, is responsible for drunkenness. Often simply referred to as alcohol, ethanol is the active ingredient \nin alcoholic beverages. Its simplicity helps it \nsneak across membranes and nestle into a many different nooks, producing a wide range of effects \ncompared to other, clunkier molecules. So how exactly does it cause drunkenness, and why does it have dramatically \ndifferent effects on different people? To answer these questions, we’ll need to follow alcohol \non its journey through the body. Alcohol lands in the stomach \nand is absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract,\nespecially the small intestine. The contents of the stomach \nimpact alcohol’s ability to get into the blood because \nafter eating, the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach \nfrom the small intestine, closes. So the level of alcohol that reaches \nthe blood after a big meal might only be a quarter that\nfrom the same drink on an empty stomach. From the blood, \nalcohol goes to the organs, especially those that get \nthe most blood flow: the liver and the brain. It hits the liver first, \nand enzymes in the liver break down the alcohol molecule \nin two steps. First, an enzyme called ADH turns alcohol \ninto acetaldehyde, which is toxic. Then, an enzyme called ALDH converts the \ntoxic acetaldehyde to non-toxic acetate. As the blood circulates, the liver \neliminates alcohol continuously— but this first pass of elimination \ndetermines how much alcohol reaches the brain and other organs. Brain sensitivity is responsible \nfor the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral effects of alcohol— \notherwise known as drunkenness. Alcohol turns up the brain’s \nprimary brake, the neurotransmitter GABA, and turns down its primary gas, \nthe neurotransmitter glutamate. This makes neurons \nmuch less communicative, and users feel relaxed at moderate doses, \nfall asleep at higher doses, and can impede the brain activity \nnecessary for survival at toxic doses. Alcohol also stimulates \na small group of neurons that extends from the midbrain \nto the nucleus accumbens, a region important for motivation. Like all addictive drugs, it prompts a squirt of dopamine \nin the nucleus accumbens which gives users a surge of pleasure. Alcohol also causes some neurons \nto synthesize and release endorphins. Endorphins help us to calm down \nin response to stress or danger. Elevated levels of endorphins \ncontribute to the euphoria and relaxation associated \nwith alcohol consumption. Finally, as the liver’s breakdown of alcohol \noutpaces the brain’s absorption, drunkenness fades away. Individual differences \nat any point in this journey can cause people \nto act more or less drunk. For example, a man and a woman who weigh \nthe same and drink the same amount during an identical meal will still have \ndifferent blood alcohol concentrations, or BACs. This is because women \ntend to have less blood— women generally have \na higher percentage of fat, which requires less blood than muscle. A smaller blood volume, \ncarrying the same amount of alcohol, means the concentration \nwill be higher for women. Genetic differences in the liver’s alcohol\nprocessing enzymes also influence BAC. And regular drinking can \nincrease production of these enzymes, contributing to tolerance. On the other hand, those who drink \nexcessively for a long time may develop liver damage,\nwhich has the opposite effect. Meanwhile, genetic differences \nin dopamine, GABA, and endorphin transmission \nmay contribute to risk for developing an alcohol use disorder. Those with naturally low endorphin \nor dopamine levels may self-medicate through drinking. Some people have a higher risk \nfor excessive drinking due to a sensitive endorphin response \nthat increases the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Others have a variation \nin GABA transmission that makes them especially sensitive \nto the sedative effects of alcohol, which decreases their risk of developing \ndisordered drinking. Meanwhile, the brain adapts to chronic \nalcohol consumption by reducing GABA, dopamine, and endorphin transmission, \nand enhancing glutamate activity. This means regular drinkers tend \nto be anxious, have trouble sleeping, and experience less pleasure. These structural and functional changes \ncan lead to disordered use when drinking feels normal, \nbut not drinking is uncomfortable, establishing a vicious cycle. So both genetics and previous experience \nimpact how a person experiences alcohol— which means that some people \nare more prone to certain patterns \nof drinking than others, and a history of consumption leads \nto neural and behavioral changes.

        "text": "There's a common misconception that if you like to meticulously \norganize your things, keep your hands clean, or plan out your weekend \nto the last detail, you might have OCD. In fact, OCD, which stands \nfor obsessive compulsive disorder, is a serious psychiatric condition that is frequently \nmisunderstood by society and mental health professionals alike. So let's start by debunking some myths. Myth one: repetitive or ritualistic\nbehaviors are synonymous with OCD. As its name suggests, obsessive compulsive disorder\nhas two aspects: the intrusive thoughts, images,\nor impulses, known as obsessions, and the behavioral \ncompulsions people engage in to relieve the anxiety \nthe obsessions cause. The kinds of actions that people often \nassociate with OCD, like excessive hand washing,\nor checking things repeatedly, may be examples of obsessive\nor compulsive tendencies that many of us exhibit from time to time. But the actual disorder is far more rare\nand can be quite debilitating. People affected have little or no\ncontrol over their obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which tend to be time consuming and interfere with work, \nschool or social life to the point of causing \nsignificant distress. This set of diagnostic criteria is what\nseparates people suffering from OCD from those who may \njust be a bit more meticulous or hygiene obsessed than usual. Myth two: the main symptom of OCD\nis excessive hand washing. Although hand washing is the most common\nimage of OCD in popular culture, obsessions and compulsions\ncan take many different forms. Obsessions can manifest \nas fears of contamination and illness, worries about harming others, or preoccupations with numbers,\npatterns, morality, or sexual identity. And compulsions can range from\nexcessive cleaning or double checking, to the fastidious arrangement of objects, or walking in predetermined patterns. Myth three: individuals with OCD don't understand\nthat they are acting irrationally. Many individuals with OCD actually\nunderstand the relationship between their obsessions \nand compulsions quite well. Being unable to avoid \nthese thoughts and actions despite being aware of their irrationality is part of the reason\nwhy OCD is so distressing. OCD sufferers report feeling crazy for experiencing anxiety \nbased on irrational thoughts and finding it difficult \nto control their responses. So what exactly causes OCD? The frustrating answer \nis we don't really know. However, we have some important clues. OCD is considered \na neurobiological disorder. In other words, research suggests \nthat OCD sufferers brains are actually hardwired \nto behave in a certain fashion. Research has implicated \nthree regions of the brain variously involved in social behavior\nand complex cognitive planning, voluntary movement, and emotional and motivational responses. The other piece of the puzzle is that OCD is associated \nwith low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter \nthat communicates between brain structures and helps regulate vital processes, such as mood, aggression, impulse control, sleep, appetite, \nbody temperature and pain. But are serotonin and activity \nin these brain regions the sources of OCD or symptoms of an unknown\nunderlying cause of the disorder. We probably won't know until we have a much more intimate \nunderstanding of the brain. The good news is there are \neffective treatments for OCD, including medications, which increase\nserotonin in the brain by limiting its reabsorption \nby brain cells, behavioral therapy that gradually\ndesensitizes patients to their anxieties, and in some cases, \nelectroconvulsive therapy, or surgery, when OCD doesn't respond\nto other forms of treatment. Knowing that your own brain \nis lying to you while not being able \nto resist its commands can be agonizing. But with knowledge and understanding\ncomes the power to seek help, and future research into the brain may finally provide \nthe answers we're looking for. "

        "text": "Day after day, the twin brothers,\nJun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball. One day, their vigorous game disturbed\nthe lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, \nthe lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head \nfrom a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention \nof one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, \nthe skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law\nand gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered \ntheir father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, \nand began to play. Soon enough, the messengers \nfrom the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened\nto their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled \nwith scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld\ncontrolled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching \nfor the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues \nof themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito \nahead of them. When it stung the figures, \nthe lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend \nthe night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they\nmust return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers \nadorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked\nto see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game\nwith their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find \nthat the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,\ntrying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure \nthis would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored\nno better than a tie, leaving them to face \nwhatever supernatural trial the lords set for them \nbefore picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold\nby lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding\nbones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, \na bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round \nof the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke\ncalled the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness \nof a head. While the lords chased the ball,\nhe swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,\nthe twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash \nso it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts\nwould not take the loss well. To protect themselves,\nthey enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned\nthe brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains\nwere thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords\ndisguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, \nIxb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted \nthat they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were \nonly too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized \nwho stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,\nand the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have\nno sacrifices and no power over the surface world. Their days of terrorizing humans \nwere over. "

        "text": "In January of 1953, a tidal surge \nshook the North Sea. The titanic waves flooded \nthe Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people. 54 years later, a similar storm \nthreatened the region. But this time, the Netherlands \nwere ready. As the water swelled, state-of-the-art computer sensors \nactivated emergency protocols. Over the next 30 minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms \nswung shut, protecting the channel ahead. Using 680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm \nwith the shifting wind and waves. By morning, the storm had passed \nwith minimal flooding. The first field activation \nof the Maeslantkering had been a resounding success. As one of the planet’s largest mobile \nstructures, this storm surge barrier \nis a marvel of human engineering. But the Maeslantkering is just one part\nof a massive, interlocking system of water controls \nknown as the Delta Works— the most sophisticated flood prevention \nproject in the world. The Netherlands has a long history \nwith water management. The country lies along the delta \nof three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of its territory \nis below sea level. This geography makes the region \nextremely prone to flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest \nDutch governing bodies were informal “water boards” that \ncoordinated flood protection projects. But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch\ngovernment took more official measures. They established the Delta Commission, and tasked them with protecting \nthe entire southwestern region. Focusing on densely populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds \nof flooding below 1 in 10,000— about 100 times as safe\nas the average coastal city. Accomplishing this lofty goal required\nvarious infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast. The first line of defense was to dam \nthe region’s flood-prone estuaries. These large inlets fed many of \nthe country’s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed \nflood water to surge inland. Using a series of dams, the Delta \nCommission transformed these estuaries into expansive lakes that serve \nas nature preserves and community parks. However, this solution wouldn’t work \nfor the Nieuwe Waterweg. As the lifeblood of the local shipping \nindustry, this passage had to be kept open \nin safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges. In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible \nprotection necessary. Alongside additional barriers, \nlike grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made up the bulk \nof the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on \nholding back ocean storms. But in the following decades, \nthe Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works \nand protect against floods further inland. Under the \"Room for the River\" plan, farms and dikes were relocated \naway from the shore. This left more space for water \nto collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats \nfor local wildlife. This strategic retreat not only \ndecreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped \nsettlements to be built more densely and sustainably. Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands' \nmulti-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city \nalmost entirely below sea level. When a storm threatens, densely populated older districts \nare protected by traditional dikes. Meanwhile, newer districts \nhave been artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs \nthat store rainwater. Numerous structures around the city \ntransform into water storage facilities, including parking garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters \nand sports arenas. Meanwhile in the harbor, floating \npavilions rise with the water level. These are the first of several planned \namphibious structures, some of which house water purification\nsystems and solar collectors. These strategies are just some \nof the technologies and policies that have put the Netherlands \nat the cutting edge of water management. The country continues to find new ways \nto make cities more resilient to natural disasters. And as the rising sea levels \ncaused by climate change threaten low-lying cities \nacross the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional \nexample of how to go with the flow. "

        "text": "In the world of math, many strange results are possible \nwhen we change the rules. But there’s one rule that most of us \nhave been warned not to break: don’t divide by zero. How can the simple combination \nof an everyday number and a basic operation \ncause such problems? Normally, dividing by smaller \nand smaller numbers gives you bigger and bigger answers. Ten divided by two is five, by one is ten, by one-millionth is 10 million, and so on. So it seems like if you divide by numbers that keep shrinking \nall the way down to zero, the answer will grow \nto the largest thing possible. Then, isn’t the answer to 10 \ndivided by zero actually infinity? That may sound plausible. But all we really know is \nthat if we divide 10 by a number that tends towards zero, the answer tends towards infinity. And that’s not the same thing as\nsaying that 10 divided by zero is equal to infinity. Why not? Well, let’s take a closer look \nat what division really means. Ten divided by two could mean, \"How many times must \nwe add two together to make 10,” or, “two times what equals 10?” Dividing by a number is essentially \nthe reverse of multiplying by it, in the following way: if we multiply any number \nby a given number x, we can ask if there’s a new number \nwe can multiply by afterwards to get back to where we started. If there is, the new number is called \nthe multiplicative inverse of x. For example, if you multiply \nthree by two to get six, you can then multiply \nby one-half to get back to three. So the multiplicative inverse \nof two is one-half, and the multiplicative inverse \nof 10 is one-tenth. As you might notice, the product of any\nnumber and its multiplicative inverse is always one. If we want to divide by zero, we need to find \nits multiplicative inverse, which should be one over zero. This would have to be such a number that\nmultiplying it by zero would give one. But because anything multiplied\nby zero is still zero, such a number is impossible, so zero has no multiplicative inverse. Does that really settle things, though? After all, mathematicians \nhave broken rules before. For example, for a long time, there was no such thing as taking \nthe square root of negative numbers. But then mathematicians defined \nthe square root of negative one as a new number called i, opening up a whole new\nmathematical world of complex numbers. So if they can do that, couldn’t we just make up a new rule, say, that the symbol infinity \nmeans one over zero, and see what happens? Let's try it, imagining we don’t know \nanything about infinity already. Based on the definition \nof a multiplicative inverse, zero times infinity must be equal to one. That means zero times infinity plus\nzero times infinity should equal two. Now, by the distributive property, the left side of the equation \ncan be rearranged to zero plus zero times infinity. And since zero plus zero \nis definitely zero, that reduces down to zero times infinity. Unfortunately, we’ve already defined \nthis as equal to one, while the other side of the equation \nis still telling us it’s equal to two. So, one equals two. Oddly enough, \nthat's not necessarily wrong; it's just not true \nin our normal world of numbers. There’s still a way it could\nbe mathematically valid, if one, two, and every other number \nwere equal to zero. But having infinity equal to zero is ultimately not all that useful \nto mathematicians, or anyone else. There actually is something called \nthe Riemann sphere that involves dividing by zero \nby a different method, but that’s a story for another day. In the meantime, dividing by zero \nin the most obvious way doesn’t work out so great. But that shouldn’t stop us \nfrom living dangerously and experimenting \nwith breaking mathematical rules to see if we can invent \nfun, new worlds to explore. "

        "text": "The full scope of a nuclear detonation \nis almost unimaginable. Hopefully, no one will ever experience \nanother of these catastrophic incidents. But there is a scientifically supported \nplan of action that could save hundreds \nof thousands of lives in the area surrounding \na nuclear explosion. So what is this plan, and what exactly would it protect us from? To create their destructive blast, these weapons harness \nthe power of nuclear fission– in which an atom’s nucleus \nis split in two. This process produces an incredible \namount of energy, and in some materials the neutrons \nproduced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms, splitting additional nuclei. These chain reactions can produce \na range of explosive yields, but let’s consider an explosion \nequivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating \na few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings \nseveral kilometers away. There is tragically nothing \nthat can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the \nshockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol \ncould be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, \nduring, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself \nfrom tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy \nbuilding would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, \nheat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s \nradius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should\nbe able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements \nof these buildings also helps provide protection from \nheat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important \nif the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt \nand debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear \nfission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term \neffect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit \nionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from \nmolecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this \nradiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, \ncancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper \natmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous \nlevels of fallout in areas up to tens of \nkilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer\nprotection from the blast are even better at \nguarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels \nthrough space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal \neffect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, \nand packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its \nenergy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could \ndramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious \neffects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at \nleast 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles\nare the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground \nor in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get \ncaught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes \nand outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated \nclothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there \nfor at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone \ninside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more \ninformation from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and\nInternet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward. Nuclear weapons are some of the most \npowerful tools of destruction on Earth, and it may seem naive to put faith in\nthese straightforward protective measures. But studies and simulations have \nrepeatedly shown the benefits of getting inside. So while we’ll hopefully never need to, remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, \nand Stay Tuned. "

        "text": "In 1997, \nin a game between France and Brazil, a young Brazilian player\nnamed Roberto Carlos set up for a 35 meter free kick. With no direct line to the goal, Carlos decided to attempt \nthe seemingly impossible. His kick sent the ball flying\nwide of the players, but just before going out of bounds,\nit hooked to the left and soared into the goal. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object will move \nin the same direction and velocity until a force is applied on it. When Carlos kicked the ball,\nhe gave it direction and velocity, but what force made the ball swerve and score one of the most magnificent \ngoals in the history of the sport? The trick was in the spin. Carlos placed his kick\nat the lower right corner of the ball, sending it high and to the right,\nbut also rotating around its axis. The ball started its flight\nin an apparently direct route, with air flowing on both sides\nand slowing it down. On one side, the air moved in the opposite\ndirection to the ball's spin, causing increased pressure, while on the other side, the air moved\nin the same direction as the spin, creating an area of lower pressure. That difference made the ball curve\ntowards the lower pressure zone. This phenomenon is called\nthe Magnus effect. This type of kick, \noften referred to as a banana kick, is attempted regularly, and it is one of the elements\nthat makes the beautiful game beautiful. But curving the ball \nwith the precision needed to both bend around the wall\nand back into the goal is difficult. Too high and it soars over the goal. Too low and it hits the ground \nbefore curving. Too wide and it never reaches the goal. Not wide enough \nand the defenders intercept it. Too slow and it hooks too early,\nor not at all. Too fast and it hooks too late. The same physics make it possible to score another \napparently impossible goal, an unassisted corner kick. The Magnus effect was first documented\nby Sir Isaac Newton after he noticed it while playing a game\nof tennis back in 1670. It also applies to golf balls,\nfrisbees and baseballs. In every case, the same thing happens. The ball's spin creates a pressure \ndifferential in the surrounding air flow that curves it \nin the direction of the spin. And here's a question. Could you theoretically \nkick a ball hard enough to make it boomerang \nall the way around back to you? Sadly, no. Even if the ball didn't \ndisintegrate on impact, or hit any obstacles, as the air slowed it, the angle of its deflection \nwould increase, causing it to spiral into smaller \nand smaller circles until finally stopping. And just to get that spiral, you'd have to make the ball spin\nover 15 times faster than Carlos's immortal kick. So good luck with that. "

        "text": "Every day, a sea of decisions \nstretches before us. Some are small and unimportant, but others have a larger impact \non our lives. For example, which politician\nshould I vote for? Should I try the latest diet craze? Or will email make me a millionaire? We're bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make \na perfect choice every time. But there are many ways \nto improve our chances, and one particularly effective technique\nis critical thinking. This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully \ndeconstruct a situation, reveal its hidden issues,\nsuch as bias and manipulation, and make the best decision. If the critical part sounds negative\nthat's because in a way it is. Rather than choosing an answer \nbecause it feels right, a person who uses critical thinking subjects all available options to scrutiny\nand skepticism. Using the tools at their disposal, they'll eliminate everything but the most\nuseful and reliable information. There are many different ways\nof approaching critical thinking, but here's one five-step process that may help you solve \nany number of problems. One: formulate your question. In other words, \nknow what you're looking for. This isn't always as straightforward \nas it sounds. For example, if you're deciding\nwhether to try out the newest diet craze, your reasons for doing so may be obscured\nby other factors, like claims that you'll see results\nin just two weeks. But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're \nactually trying to accomplish by dieting, whether that's weight loss, better nutrition, or having more energy, that'll equip you to sift through \nthis information critically, find what you're looking for, and decide whether the new fad\nreally suits your needs. Two: gather your information. There's lots of it out there, so having a clear idea of your question\nwill help you determine what's relevant. If you're trying to decide on a diet\nto improve your nutrition, you may ask an expert for their advice, or seek other people's testimonies. Information gathering helps you\nweigh different options, moving you closer to a decision\nthat meets your goal. Three: apply the information, something you do \nby asking critical questions. Facing a decision, ask yourself,\n\"What concepts are at work?\" \"What assumptions exist?\" \"Is my interpretation of the information\nlogically sound?\" For example, in an email that promises\nyou millions, you should consider, \"What is shaping\nmy approach to this situation?\" \"Do I assume the sender \nis telling the truth?\" \"Based on the evidence, is it logical \nto assume I'll win any money?\" Four: consider the implications. Imagine it's election time, and you've selected a political\ncandidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for drivers\nto fill up on gas. At first glance, that seems great. But what about the long-term \nenvironmental effects? If gasoline use is less \nrestricted by cost, this could also cause a huge\nsurge in air pollution, an unintended consequence \nthat's important to think about. Five: explore other points of view. Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of \nthe opposing political candidate.

        "text": "The annals of Ancient Egyptian king \nThutmose III described a marvelous foreign bird that “gives birth daily.” Zoroastrians viewed them as spirits whose cries told of the cosmic struggle between darkness and light. Romans brought them on\ntheir military campaigns to foretell the success of future battles. And today, this bird still occupies\nan important, though much less honorable position – on our dinner plates. The modern chicken is descended\nprimarily from the Red Junglefowl, and partially from three other \nclosely related species, all native to India and Southeast Asia. The region’s bamboo plants produce massive amounts of fruit just once every few decades. Junglefowls’ ability to lay eggs daily may have evolved to take advantage \nof these rare feasts, increasing their population\nwhen food was abundant. This was something humans could exploit on a consistent basis, and the birds’ weak flight capabilities and limited need for space made them easy to capture and contain. The earliest domesticated chickens, dating at least back to 7,000 years ago, weren’t bred for food, but for something considered\nless savory today. The aggressiveness of breeding males, armed with natural leg spurs, made cockfighting a popular entertainment. By the second millennium BCE, chickens had spread from the \nIndus Valley to China and the Middle East to occupy\nroyal menageries and to be used in religious rituals. But it was in Egypt where the next chapter in\nthe bird’s history began. When a hen naturally incubates eggs, she will stop laying new ones and sit on a “clutch” of 6\nor more eggs for 21 days. By the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, the Egyptians had learned to artificially incubate chicken eggs by placing them in baskets over hot ashes. That freed up hens to continue\nlaying daily, and what had been a royal delicacy or religious offering became a common meal. Around the same time as Egyptians\nwere incubating eggs, Phoenician merchants introduced\nchickens to Europe, where they quickly became\nan essential part of European livestock. However, for a long time, the chicken’s revered status \ncontinued to exist alongside its culinary one. The Ancient Greeks used fighting roosters as inspirational examples \nfor young soldiers. The Romans consulted chickens as oracles. And as late as the 7th Century, the chicken was considered\na symbol for Christianity. Over the next few centuries, chickens accompanied humans\nwherever they went, spreading throughout the world\nthrough trade, conquest, and colonization. After the Opium Wars, Chinese breeds were brought to England and crossed with local chickens. This gave rise to a phenomenon called “Hen Fever” or “The Fancy”, with farmers all over Europe striving to breed new varieties with particular combinations of traits. This trend also caught the attention of a certain Charles Darwin,\nwho wondered if a similar selective breeding process\noccurred in nature. Darwin would observe hundreds of chickens while finalizing his historic work introducing the theory of Evolution. But the chicken’s greatest\ncontribution to science was yet to come. In the early 20th century, a trio of British scientists conducted extensive crossbreeding\nof chickens, building on Gregor Mendel’s studies of genetic inheritance. With their high genetic diversity, many distinct traits, and only 7 months between generations, chickens were the perfect subject. This work resulted in the famous\nPunnett Square, used to show the genotypes\nthat would result from breeding a given pairing. Since then, numerous breeding initiatives\nhave made chickens bigger and meatier, and allowed them to lay \nmore eggs than ever. Meanwhile, chicken production has shifted \nto an industrial, factory-like model, with birds raised in spaces \nwith a footprint no larger than a sheet of paper. And while there’s been a shift\ntowards free-range farming due to animal rights \nand environmental concerns, most of the world’s more than\n22 billion chickens today are factory farmed. From gladiators and gifts to the gods, to traveling companions \nand research subjects, chickens have played many roles\nover the centuries. And though they may not have come \nbefore the proverbial egg, chickens’ fascinating history tells us \na great deal about our own. "

        "text": "What rights do people have,\nand where do they come from? Who gets to make decisions for others\nand on what authority? And how can we organize society\nto meet people's needs? These questions challenged\nan entire nation during the upheaval\nof the French Revolution. By the end of the 18th century, Europe had undergone a profound\nintellectual and cultural shift known as the Enlightenment. Philosophers and artists promoted\nreason and human freedom over tradition and religion. The rise of a middle class\nand printed materials encouraged political awareness, and the American Revolution had turned\na former English colony into an independent republic. Yet France, one of the largest and richest\ncountries in Europe was still governed by an ancient regime\nof three rigid social classes called Estates. The monarch King Louis XVI\nbased his authority on divine right and granted special privileges\nto the First and Second Estates, the Catholic clergy, and the nobles. The Third Estate, middle class merchants\nand craftsmen, as well as over 20 million peasants,\nhad far less power and they were the only ones\nwho paid taxes, not just to the king,\nbut to the other Estates as well. In bad harvest years, taxation could leave peasants\nwith almost nothing while the king and nobles lived lavishly\non their extracted wealth. But as France sank into debt due to\nits support of the American Revolution and its long-running war with England, change was needed. King Louis appointed\nfinance minister Jacques Necker, who pushed for tax reforms and won public support by openly\npublishing the government's finances. But the king's advisors\nstrongly opposed these initiatives. Desperate for a solution, the king called\na meeting of the Estates-General, an assembly of representatives\nfrom the Three Estates, for the first time in 175 years. Although the Third Estate represented\n98% of the French population, its vote was equal to each\nof the other Estates. And unsurprisingly, both of the upper\nclasses favored keeping their privileges. Realizing they couldn't\nget fair representation, the Third Estate broke off, declared themselves\nthe National Assembly, and pledged to draft a new constitution\nwith or without the other Estates. King Louis ordered the First\nand Second Estates to meet with the National Assembly, but he also dismissed Necker,\nhis popular finance minister. In response, thousands\nof outraged Parisians joined with sympathetic soldiers\nto storm the Bastille prison, a symbol of royal power\nand a large storehouse of weapons. The Revolution had begun. As rebellion spread\nthroughout the country, the feudal system was abolished. The Assembly's Declaration\nof the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed a radical idea for the time -- that individual rights and freedoms\nwere fundamental to human nature and government existed\nonly to protect them. Their privileges gone,\nmany nobles fled abroad, begging foreign rulers to invade France\nand restore order. And while Louis remained as the figurehead\nof the constitutional monarchy, he feared for his future. In 1791, he tried to flee the country\nbut was caught. The attempted escape shattered\npeople's faith in the king. The royal family was arrested\nand the king charged with treason. After a trial, the once-revered king\nwas publicly beheaded, signaling the end of one thousand\nyears of monarchy and finalizing the September 21st\ndeclaration of the first French republic, governed by the motto\n\"liberté, égalité, fraternité.\" Nine months later, Queen Marie Antoinette, a foreigner long-mocked\nas \"Madame Déficit\" for her extravagant reputation, was executed as well. But the Revolution would not end there. Some leaders, not content\nwith just changing the government, sought to completely transform\nFrench society -- its religion,\nits street names, even its calendar. As multiple factions formed, the extremist Jacobins\nlead by Maximilien Robespierre launched a Reign of Terror to suppress the slightest dissent, executing over 20,000 people before the Jacobin's own downfall. Meanwhile, France found itself\nat war with neighboring monarchs seeking to strangle the Revolution\nbefore it spread. Amidst the chaos, a general named\nNapoleon Bonaparte took charge, becoming Emperor as he claimed to defend\nthe Revolution's democratic values. All in all, the Revolution\nsaw three constitutions and five governments within ten years, followed by decades\nalternating between monarchy and revolt before the next Republic formed in 1871. And while we celebrate\nthe French Revolution's ideals, we still struggle with many\nof the same basic questions raised over two centuries ago. "

        "text": "Ani stands before a large golden scale where the jackal-headed god\nAnubis is weighing his heart against a pure ostrich feather. Ani was a real person, a scribe from the Egyptian city\nof Thebes who lived in the 13th century BCE. And depicted here is a scene\nfrom his Book of the Dead, a 78-foot papyrus scroll\ndesigned to help him attain immortality. Such funerary texts were originally\nwritten only for Pharaohs, but with time, the Egyptians came\nto believe regular people could also reach\nthe afterlife if they succeeded in the passage. Ani's epic journey begins with his death. His body is mummified by a team of priests who remove every organ except the heart, the seat of emotion, memory, \nand intelligence. It's then stuffed with a salt\ncalled natron and wrapped in resin-soaked linen. In addition, the wrappings are woven\nwith charms for protection and topped with a heart scarab amulet\nthat will prove important later on. The goal of the two-month process\nis to preserve Ani's body as an ideal form with which his spirit \ncan eventually reunite. But first, that spirit must pass\nthrough the duat, or underworld. This is a realm of vast caverns, lakes of fire, and magical gates, all guarded by fearsome beasts - snakes, crocodiles,\nand half-human monstrosities with names like \"he who dances in blood.\" To make things worse, Apep, the serpent\ngod of destruction, lurks in the shadows waiting to swallow\nAni's soul. Fortunately, Ani is prepared with the magic contained \nwithin his book of the dead. Like other Egyptians who could afford it, Ani customized his scroll to include\nthe particular spells, prayers, and codes he thought his spirit might need. Equipped with this arsenal, our hero traverses the obstacles, repels the monsters' acts, and stealthily avoids Apep to reach the Hall of Ma'at,\ngoddess of truth and justice. Here, Ani faces his final challenge. He is judged by 42 assessor gods who must be convinced \nthat he has lived a righteous life. Ani approaches each one, addressing them by name, and declaring a sin he has not committed. Among these negative confessions,\nor declarations of innocence, he proclaims that he has not made\nanyone cry, is not an eavesdropper, and has not polluted the water. But did Ani really live \nsuch a perfect life? Not quite, but that's where \nthe heart scarab amulet comes in. It's inscribed with the words,\n\"Do not stand as a witness against me,\" precisely so Ani's heart \ndoesn't betray him by recalling the time he listened\nto his neighbors fight or washed his feet in the Nile. Now, it's Ani's moment of truth,\nthe weighing of the heart. If his heart is heavier than the feather,\nweighed down by Ani's wrongdoings, it'll be devoured \nby the monstrous Ammit, part crocodile, part leopard, \npart hippopotamus, and Ani will cease to exist forever. But Ani is in luck. His heart is judged pure. Ra, the sun god, takes him to Osiris,\ngod of the underworld, who gives him final approval to enter\nthe afterlife. In the endless and lush field of reeds, Ani meets his deceased parents. Here, there is no sadness, pain, or anger,\nbut there is work to be done. Like everyone else, Ani must cultivate\na plot of land, which he does with the help of a Shabti\ndoll that had been placed in his tomb. Today, the Papyrus of Ani resides\nin the British Museum, where it has been since 1888. Only Ani, if anyone, knows what really\nhappened after his death. But thanks to his Book of the Dead, we can imagine him happily tending\nhis crops for all eternity. "

        "text": "Have you ever noticed something swimming\nin your field of vision? It may look like a tiny worm\nor a transparent blob, and whenever you try to get\na closer look, it disappears, only to reappear\nas soon as you shift your glance. But don't go rinsing out your eyes! What you are seeing is a common phenomenon known as a floater. The scientific name for these objects\nis Muscae volitantes, Latin for \"flying flies,\" and true to their name,\nthey can be somewhat annoying. But they're not actually bugs\nor any kind of external objects at all. Rather, they exist inside your eyeball. Floaters may seem to be alive,\nsince they move and change shape, but they are not alive. Floaters are tiny objects\nthat cast shadows on the retina, the light-sensitive tissue\nat the back of your eye. They might be bits of tissue, red blood cells, or clumps of protein. And because they're suspended\nwithin the vitreous humor, the gel-like liquid\nthat fills the inside of your eye, floaters drift along\nwith your eye movements, and seem to bounce a little\nwhen your eye stops. Floaters may be only\nbarely distinguishable most of the time. They become more visible\nthe closer they are to the retina, just as holding your hand closer\nto a table with an overhead light will result in a more\nsharply defined shadow. And floaters are particularly noticeable when you are looking\nat a uniform bright surface, like a blank computer screen, snow, or a clear sky, where the consistency of the background\nmakes them easier to distinguish. The brighter the light is,\nthe more your pupil contracts. This has an effect similar\nto replacing a large diffuse light fixture with a single overhead light bulb, which also makes\nthe shadow appear clearer. There is another visual phenomenon\nthat looks similar to floaters but is in fact unrelated. If you've seen tiny dots of light\ndarting about when looking at a bright blue sky, you've experienced what is known\nas the blue field entoptic phenomenon. In some ways,\nthis is the opposite of seeing floaters. Here, you are not seeing shadows but little moving windows\nletting light through to your retina. The windows are actually caused\nby white blood cells moving through the capillaries\nalong your retina's surface. These leukocytes can be so large\nthat they nearly fill a capillary causing a plasma space\nto open up in front of them. Because the space\nand the white blood cells are both more transparent to blue light than the red blood cells\nnormally present in capillaries, we see a moving dot of light\nwherever this happens, following the paths of your capillaries\nand moving in time with your pulse. Under ideal viewing conditions, you might even see what looks\nlike a dark tail following the dot. This is the red blood cells\nthat have bunched up behind the leukocyte. Some science museums have an exhibit\nwhich consists of a screen of blue light, allowing you to see these blue sky sprites\nmuch more clearly than you normally would. While everybody's eyes experience\nthese sort of effects, the number and type vary greatly. In the case of floaters, they often go unnoticed,\nas our brain learns to ignore them. However, abnormally numerous or large floaters\nthat interfere with vision may be a sign of a more serious condition,\nrequiring immediate medical treatment. But the majority of the time\nentoptic phenomena, such as floaters and blue sky sprites, are just a gentle reminder\nthat what we think we see depends just as much\non our biology and minds as it does on the external world.

After a quick visit to the market, she spots her brothers, Lucius and Marcus,\ncrossing the Forum. They’re off to relax at the public baths. Marcus spent the morning helping a master \ncraftsman lay a grand mosaic floor while Lucius worked in the brickyard. It’s been 17 years since an earthquake hit\nPompeii and its neighbor Herculaneum, and there’s still construction\nand repair work to do. Fabia and her brothers discuss the recent \ntremors everyone’s been feeling. Lucius jokes that there’ll always be work \nfor men who rebuild walls in Pompeii. He tells them how eager he is to bind\nhands with his sponsa, or bride-to-be. The siblings begin discussing \ntomorrow’s wedding— but a deafening boom interrupts them. They watch Vesuvius spew smoke, ash, \nand rock high into the air— and realize they've been living\nin the shadow of a volcano. They embrace and pray to Venus \nfor protection and Vulcan for mercy. Each must now choose how to survive. They have three options: \nseek shelter, escape to the south on foot, or flee to the west by sea. Lucius rushes home \nbut can’t find his sponsa. He decides to wait for her \nand lights an oil lamp. Ash and pumice begin raining over Pompeii. Fabia shelters with her husband,\nClaudius, and their daughters. But after a few hours, their roof groans \nunder the weight of volcanic debris, and they realize they can't stay. They decide to travel southeast,\naway from the volcano. The family joins swarms of people wading\nthrough hot ash on the cardo maximus and begins navigating towards \none of Pompeii’s southern gates. Marcus finally reaches his home \nin Herculaneum and gathers his wife and children. They decide to escape by sea. But as they approach the docks, they discover waves brimming \nwith volcanic matter, making it impossible for boats \nto navigate close enough to shore. Trying to keep calm for their children,\nthey huddle underneath covered boat docks. Now, the deadliest phase \nof the disaster begins. At this point, the force throwing \nthe volcanic material, or tephra, into the air diminishes, \nand it comes crashing down. Hot ash and noxious gas billow out \nin a wave known as a pyroclastic surge. This first surge engulfs Herculaneum. One hour later, \nanother three times as strong collapses the town’s remaining structures. These have yet to reach Pompeii, but buildings are ablaze \nin the hot, sulfurous air. Lucius climbs out of his closet \nand tries his front door, but a deep blanket of ash and stone \nwon’t let it budge. His lamp flickers and dies. After more than 14 hours, at times walking\nthrough ash up to their chests, Fabia, her family, and the others\nwho left early enough, climb the southern Latarri mountains. They reach a peak and pause to look back. Another pyroclastic surge rushes across\nthe valley, crashes into Pompei, and sheers off the upper levels\nof the town’s buildings. Fighting back tears, Fabia continues \nto push her family on towards safety, praying for her brothers\nand fellow townspeople. According to modern analysis, the eruption\nmay have lasted days or weeks. When it was over, almost \n300 square kilometers were decimated, and Pompeii and Herculaneum lay\nunder up to 65 feet of tephra. Despite some disorganized\nlooting and digging, these towns remained buried until official\nexcavations began in the mid-1800s. Archaeologists have since analyzed \nskeletal evidence and volcanic deposits to reconstruct a timeline of Herculaneum \nand Pompeii’s final moments. They've revealed a poignant glimpse at the\nexperiences of the eruption's victims. Much of our understanding\nof ancient Roman life— from food and furniture \nto architecture and economics— comes from these ruins. In their time, they were simply \nprovincial towns in the Bay of Naples. But their rediscovery has given us an \nunparalleled view into the ancient world and the lives that were devastated \nby disaster. "

        "text": "Has anyone ever told you,\n\"Stand up straight!\" or scolded you for slouching\nat a family dinner? Comments like that might be annoying,\nbut they're not wrong. Your posture, the way you hold your body\nwhen you're sitting or standing, is the foundation for every movement\nyour body makes, and can determine how well your body\nadapts to the stresses on it. These stresses can be things \nlike carrying weight, or sitting in an awkward position. And the big one we all experience \nall day every day: gravity. If your posture isn't optimal, your muscles have to work harder\nto keep you upright and balanced. Some muscles will become tight\nand inflexbile. Others will be inhibited. Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations impair your body's ability \nto deal with the forces on it. Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear\non your joints and ligaments, increases the likelihood of accidents, and makes some organs, \nlike your lungs, less efficient. Researchers have linked \npoor posture to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain, though it isn't the exclusive \ncause of any of them. Posture can even influence \nyour emotional state and your sensitivity to pain. So there are a lot of reasons\nto aim for good posture. But it's getting harder these days. Sitting in an awkward position \nfor a long time can promote poor posture, and so can using computers \nor mobile devices, which encourage you to look downward. Many studies suggest that, on average,\nposture is getting worse. So what does good posture look like? When you look at the spine \nfrom the front or the back, all 33 vertebrae should appear stacked\nin a straight line. From the side, the spine\nshould have three curves: one at your neck, one at your shoulders,\nand one at the small of your back. You aren't born with this s-shaped spine. Babies' spines just have one curve like a \"c.\" The other curves usually develop\nby 12-18 months as the muscles strengthen. These curves help us stay upright\nand absorb some of the stress from activities like walking and jumping. If they are aligned properly, when you're standing up, you should be able to draw a straight line from a point just in front \nof your shoulders, to behind your hip, to the front of your knee, to a few inches in front of your ankle. This keeps your center of gravity\ndirectly over your base of support, which allows you to move efficiently with the least amount of fatigue\nand muscle strain. If you're sitting, \nyour neck should be vertical, not tilted forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed\nwith your arms close to your trunk. Your knees should be at a right angle\nwith your feet flat on the floor. But what if your posture isn't that great? Try redesigning your environment. Adjust your screen so it's at\nor slightly below eyelevel. Make sure all parts of your body, like your elbows and wrists, \nare supported, using ergonomic aids if you need to. Try sleeping on your side\nwith your neck supported and with a pillow between your legs. Wear shoes with low heels\nand good arch support, and use a headset for phone calls. It's also not enough \nto just have good posture. Keeping your muscles and joints moving\nis extremely important. In fact, being stationary for long periods\nwith good posture can be worse than regular movement\nwith bad posture. When you do move, move smartly. Keep anything you're carrying\nclose to your body. Backpacks should be in contact \nwith your back carried symetrically. If you sit a lot, get up and move around\non occassion, and be sure to exercise. Using your muscles will keep them\nstrong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits \nto your joints, bones, brain and heart. And if you're really worried,\ncheck with a physical therapist, because yes, \nyou really should stand up straight. "

Are you better than average at grammar? Knowing how competent we are and how are skill stack up \nagainst other people's is more than a self-esteem boost. It helps us figure out when we can forge\nahead on our own decisions and instincts and when we need, instead, \nto seek out advice. But psychological research suggests\nthat we're not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately. In fact, we frequently overestimate\nour own abilities. Researchers have a name \nfor this phenomena, the Dunning-Kruger effect. This effect explains \nwhy more than 100 studies have shown that people display \nillusory superiority. We judge ourselves as better than others to a degree that violates \nthe laws of math. When software engineers at two companies\nwere asked to rate their performance, 32% of the engineers at one company\nand 42% at the other put themselves in the top 5%. In another study, 88% of American drivers described themselves \nas having above average driving skills. These aren't isolated findings. On average, people tend to rate\nthemselves better than most in disciplines ranging from health,\nleadership skills, ethics, and beyond. What's particularly interesting\nis that those with the least ability are often the most likely to overrate\ntheir skills to the greatest extent. People measurably poor \nat logical reasoning, grammar, financial knowledge, math, emotional intelligence, running medical lab tests, and chess all tend to rate their expertise almost\nas favorably as actual experts do. So who's most vulnerable to this delusion? Sadly, all of us because we all have\npockets of incompetence we don't recognize. But why? When psychologists Dunning and Kruger\nfirst described the effect in 1999, they argued that people lacking\nknowledge and skill in particular areas suffer a double curse. First, they make mistakes\nand reach poor decisions. But second, those same knowledge gaps also\nprevent them from catching their errors. In other words, poor performers lack\nthe very expertise needed to recognize how badly they're doing. For example, when the researchers studied participants in \na college debate tournament, the bottom 25% of teams \nin preliminary rounds lost nearly four \nout of every five matches. But they thought they were winning\nalmost 60%. WIthout a strong grasp \nof the rules of debate, the students simply couldn't recognize\nwhen or how often their arguments broke down. The Dunning-Kruger effect isn't a question\nof ego blinding us to our weaknesses. People usually do admit their deficits\nonce they can spot them. In one study, students who had initially\ndone badly on a logic quiz and then took a mini course on logic were quite willing to label\ntheir original performances as awful. That may be why people with a moderate\namount of experience or expertise often have less confidence\nin their abilities. They know enough to know that \nthere's a lot they don't know. Meanwhile, experts tend to be aware\nof just how knowledgeable they are. But they often make a different mistake: they assume that everyone else \nis knowledgeable, too. The result is that people, \nwhether they're inept or highly skilled, are often caught in a bubble\nof inaccurate self-perception. When they're unskilled, \nthey can't see their own faults. When they're exceptionally competent, they don't perceive how unusual \ntheir abilities are. So if the Dunning-Kruger effect \nis invisible to those experiencing it, what can you do to find out how good\nyou actually are at various things? First, ask for feedback from other people, and consider it, \neven if it's hard to hear. Second, and more important, keep learning. The more knowledgeable we become, the less likely we are to have\ninvisible holes in our competence. Perhaps it all boils down \nto that old proverb: When arguing with a fool, first make sure the other person\nisn't doing the same thing. "

        "text": "As a wildfire rages through\nthe grasslands, three lions and three wildebeest\nflee for their lives. To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank\nof a crocodile-infested river. Fortunately, there happens\nto be a raft nearby. It can carry up to two animals at a time, and needs as least one lion\nor wildebeest on board to row it across the river. There's just one problem. If the lions ever outnumber the\nwildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, their instincts will kick in,\nand the results won't be pretty. That includes the animals in the boat\nwhen it's on a given side of the river. What's the fastest way for all six animals\nto get across without the lions stopping for dinner? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you feel stuck on a problem like this, try listing all the decisions you can make\nat each point, and the consequences each choice\nleads to. For instance, there are five options\nfor who goes across first: one wildebeest, one lion, two wildebeest, two lions, or one of each. If one animal goes alone, it'll just have to come straight back. And if two wildebeest cross first, the remaining one will immediately\nget eaten. So those options are all out. Sending two lions, or one of each animal, can actually both lead to solutions\nin the same number of moves. For the sake of time,\nwe'll focus on the second one. One of each animal crosses. Now, if the wildebeest stays \nand the lion returns, there will be three lions\non the right bank. Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest. So we need to have the lion\nstay on the left bank and the wildebeest go back to the right. Now we have the same five options, but with one lion \nalready on the left bank. If two wildebeest go,\nthe one that stays will get eaten, and if one of each animal goes, the wildebeest on the raft\nwill be outnumbered as soon as it reaches the other side. So that's a dead end, which means that at the third crossing, only the two lions can go. One gets dropped off, leaving two lions on the left bank. The third lion takes the raft back to\nthe right bank where the wildebeest are waiting. What now? Well, since we've got two lions waiting\non the left bank, the only option is for two wildebeest\nto cross. Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest\ngoing back, since that just reverses the last step. And if two lions go back, they'll outnumber the wildebeest\non the right bank. So one lion and one wildebeest\ntake the raft back leaving us with one of each animal\non the left bank and two of each on the right. Again, there's no point in sending \nthe lion-wildebeest pair back, so the next trip should be either\na pair of lions or a pair of wildebeest. If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest\non the left, so they stay, and the two wildebeest cross instead. Now we're quite close because the\nwildebeest are all where they need to be with safety in numbers. All that's left is for that one lion\nto raft back and bring his fellow lions over\none by one. That makes eleven trips total, the smallest number needed\nto get everyone across safely. The solution that involves sending both\nlions on the first step works similarly, and also takes eleven crossings. The six animals escape unharmed\nfrom the fire just in time and begin their new lives \nacross the river. Of course, now that the danger's passed, it remains to be seen how long their\nunlikely alliance will last. "

        "text": "Cramming for a test? Trying to get more done\nthan you have time to do? Stress is a feeling we all experience\nwhen we are challenged or overwhelmed. But more than just an emotion, stress is a hardwired physical response\nthat travels throughout your entire body. In the short term, \nstress can be advantageous, but when activated too often or too long, your primitive fight or flight \nstress response not only changes your brain but also damages many of the other\norgans and cells throughout your body. Your adrenal gland releases \nthe stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, \nalso known as adrenaline, and norepinephrine. As these hormones \ntravel through your blood stream, they easily reach \nyour blood vessels and heart. Adrenaline causes \nyour heart to beat faster and raises your blood pressure,\nover time causing hypertension. Cortisol can also cause the endothelium,\nor inner lining of blood vessels, to not function normally. Scientists now know \nthat this is an early step in triggering the process \nof atherosclerosis or cholesterol plaque\nbuild up in your arteries. Together, these changes increase \nyour chances of a heart attack or stroke. When your brain senses stress, it activates your \nautonomic nervous system. Through this network \nof nerve connections, your big brain communicates\nstress to your enteric, or intestinal nervous system. Besides causing butterflies \nin your stomach, this brain-gut connection can disturb\nthe natural rhythmic contractions that move food through your gut, leading to irritable bowel syndrome, and can increase your \ngut sensitivity to acid, making you more likely to feel heartburn. Via the gut's nervous system, stress can also change the composition\nand function of your gut bacteria, which may affect your digestive\nand overall health. Speaking of digestion, does chronic\nstress affect your waistline? Well, yes. Cortisol can increase your appetite. It tells your body to replenish \nyour energy stores with energy dense foods and carbs,\ncausing you to crave comfort foods. High levels of cortisol can also cause you\nto put on those extra calories as visceral or deep belly fat. This type of fat doesn't just make\nit harder to button your pants. It is an organ \nthat actively releases hormones and immune system chemicals \ncalled cytokines that can increase your risk\nof developing chronic diseases, such as heart disease \nand insulin resistance. Meanwhile, stress hormones \naffect immune cells in a variety of ways. Initially, they help prepare \nto fight invaders and heal after injury, but chronic stress can dampen function\nof some immune cells, make you more susceptible to infections,\nand slow the rate you heal. Want to live a long life? You may have to curb your chronic stress. That's because it has even been\nassociated with shortened telomeres, the shoelace tip ends of chromosomes\nthat measure a cell's age. Telomeres cap chromosomes to allow DNA to get copied\nevery time a cell divides without damaging \nthe cell's genetic code, and they shorten with each cell division. When telomeres become too short,\na cell can no longer divide and it dies. As if all that weren't enough, chronic stress has even more ways\nit can sabotage your health, including acne, hair loss, sexual dysfunction, headaches, muscle tension, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, and irritability. So, what does all this mean for you? Your life will always be filled\nwith stressful situations. But what matters to your brain\nand entire body is how you respond to that stress. If you can view those situations\nas challenges you can control and master, rather than as threats \nthat are insurmountable, you will perform better in the short run\nand stay healthy in the long run.

        "text": "In 1990, the Italian government \nenlisted top engineers to stabilize Pisa’s famous Leaning Tower. There’d been many attempts to right the\ntower during its 800 year history, but this team’s computer models revealed \nthe urgency of their situation. They projected the tower would topple if \nit reached an angle of 5.44 degrees— and it was currently leaning at 5.5. No one knew how the tower was still \nstanding, but the crisis was clear: they had to solve a problem that \nstumped centuries of engineers, and they needed to do it fast. To understand their situation, it’s helpful to understand why the \ntower tilted in the first place. In the 12th century, the wealthy \nmaritime republic of Pisa set about turning its cathedral square \ninto a magnificent landmark. Workers embellished and enlarged \nthe existing church, and added a massive domed \nbaptistry to the plaza. In 1173, construction began on a \nfree-standing campanile, or bell tower. The engineers and architects of the \ntime were masters of their craft. But for all their engineering knowledge, they knew far less about the \nground they stood on. Pisa’s name comes from a \nGreek word for “marshy land,\" which perfectly describes the clay, mud, \nand wet sand below the city’s surface. Ancient Romans counteracted similar \nconditions with massive stone pillars called piles which rest on \nEarth’s stable bedrock. However, the tower’s architects believed \na three-meter foundation would suffice for their relatively short structure. Unfortunately for them, \nless than five years later, the tower’s southern side \nwas already underground. Such a shifting foundation would \nnormally have been a fatal flaw. If workers added more weight, the pressure from upper stories \nwould sink the structure and fatally increase the lean. But construction halted at the \nfourth story for nearly a century as Pisa descended into prolonged warfare. This long pause allowed \nthe soil to settle, and when construction \nbegan again in 1272, the foundation was on \nslightly more stable footing. Under the direction of \narchitect Giovanni di Simone, workers compensated for \nthe tower’s minor tilt by making the next few floors taller \non the southern side. But the weight of the extra masonry \nmade that side sink even deeper. By the time they completed the seventh \nfloor and bell chamber, the angle of the tilt was 1.6 degrees. For centuries, engineers tried numerous \nstrategies to address the lean. In 1838, they dug a walkway around the \nbase to examine the sunken foundation. But removing the supporting sand only \nworsened the tilt. In 1935, the Italian Corps of Engineers \ninjected mortar to strengthen the base. However, the mortar wasn’t evenly \ndistributed throughout the foundation, resulting in another sudden drop. All these failed attempts, along with \nthe ever-sinking foundation, moved the tower closer to \nits tipping point. And without definitive knowledge \nof the soil composition, engineers couldn’t pinpoint \nthe tower’s fatal angle or devise a way to stop its fall. In the years following WWII, researchers developed tests to \nidentify those missing variables. And in the 1970’s, engineers calculated \nthe curved tower’s center of gravity. With this data and new \ncomputing technology, engineers could model how stiff \nthe soil was, the tower’s trajectory, and the exact amount of excavation \nneeded for the tower to remain standing. In 1992, the team drilled diagonal tunnels to remove 38 cubic meters of soil \nfrom under the tower’s north end. Then, they temporarily counterbalanced \nthe structure with 600 tons of lead ingots before anchoring the base \nwith steel cables. More than six centuries \nafter its construction, the tower was finally straightened… \nto a tilt of about four degrees. No one wanted the tower to fall, but they also didn’t want to lose the \nlandmark’s most famous feature. Today the tower stands at \n55– or 56– meters tall, and it should remain stable \nfor at least 300 years as a monument to the \nbeauty of imperfection. "

        "text": "One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco\nfor a vacation with his family, Colombian journalist Gabriel García \nMárquez abruptly turned his car around, asked his wife to take care of the\nfamily’s finances for the coming months, and returned home. The beginning of a new book \nhad suddenly come to him: “Many years later, \nas he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember \nthat distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” Over the next eighteen months, those words would blossom \ninto One Hundred Years of Solitude. A novel that would go on \nto bring Latin American literature to the forefront \nof the global imagination, earning García Márquez \nthe 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature. What makes One Hundred Years of Solitude \nso remarkable? The novel chronicles the fortunes\nand misfortunes of the Buendía family \nover seven generations. With its lush, detailed sentences, large cast of characters, and tangled narrative, One Hundred Years of Solitude \nis not an easy book to read. But it’s a deeply rewarding one, with an epic assortment \nof intense romances, civil war, political intrigue, globe-trotting adventurers, and more characters \nnamed Aureliano than you’d think possible. Yet this is no mere historical drama. One Hundred Years of Solitude \nis one of the most famous examples of a literary genre \nknown as magical realism. Here, supernatural events or abilities are described in a realistic \nand matter-of-fact tone, while the real events of human life \nand history reveal themselves \nto be full of fantastical absurdity. Surreal phenomena within the\nfictional village of Macondo intertwine seamlessly with events taking\nplace in the real country of Colombia. The settlement begins \nin a mythical state of isolation, but is gradually exposed \nto the outside world, facing multiple calamities along the way. As years pass, \ncharacters grow old and die, only to return as ghosts, or to be seemingly reincarnated \nin the next generation. When the American fruit company \ncomes to town, so does a romantic mechanic who is\nalways followed by yellow butterflies. A young woman up and floats away. Although the novel moves forward \nthrough subsequent generations, time moves in an almost cyclical manner. Many characters have similar names \nand features to their forebears, whose mistakes they often repeat. Strange prophecies \nand visits from mysterious gypsies give way to the skirmishes \nand firing squads of repeated civil wars. An American fruit company opens \na plantation near the village and ends up massacring thousands \nof striking workers, mirroring the real-life \n‘Banana Massacre’ of 1928. Combined with the novel’s magical realism, this produces a sense \nof history as a downward spiral the characters seem powerless to escape. Beneath the magic is a story \nabout the pattern of Colombian and Latin American history \nfrom colonial times onward. This is a history that \nthe author experienced firsthand. Gabriel García Márquez grew up\nin a Colombia torn apart by civil conflict between its Conservative \nand Liberal political parties. He also lived in an autocratic Mexico and covered the 1958 Venezuelan \ncoup d’état as a journalist. But perhaps his biggest influences \nwere his maternal grandparents. Nicolás Ricardo Márquez was a\ndecorated veteran of the Thousand Days War whose accounts of the rebellion against\nColombia's conservative government led Gabriel García Márquez \nto a socialist outlook. Meanwhile, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes’\nomnipresent superstition became the foundation \nof One Hundred Years of Solitude’s style. Their small house in Aracataca \nwhere the author spent his childhood formed the main inspiration for Macondo. With One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Márquez \nfound a unique way to capture the unique history \nof Latin America. He was able to depict the strange reality \nof living in a post-colonial society, forced to relive \nthe tragedies of the past. In spite of all this fatalism,\nthe novel still holds hope. At his Nobel Lecture, García Marquez reflected \non Latin America’s long history of civil strife and rampant iniquity. Yet he ended the speech by affirming the\npossibility of building a better world, to quote, “where no one will be able\nto decide for others how they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races condemned \nto one hundred years of solitude will have, at last and forever,\na second chance on earth.\" "

        "text": "After a savage seafaring skirmish and eight long days of being \nbattered by waves, Väinämöinen— a powerful bard and \nsage as old as the world itself— washed up on the shores \nof distant Pohjola. Unlike his home Kalevala, Pohjola was \na dark and frozen land, ruled by Louhi, “the gap-tooth \nhag of the North.\" The cunning witch nursed Väinämöinen \nback to health but demanded a reward for \nreturning him home. Not content with mere gold or silver, Louhi wanted what did not yet exist— \nthe Sampo. To be forged from “the tips of white-swan\nfeathers,\" “the milk of greatest virtue,\" “a single grain of barley,\" and \n“the finest wool of lambskins,\" this artifact was said to be \nan endless font of wealth. But Väinämöinen knew that \nonly Seppo Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer who forged \nthe sky-dome itself, could craft such an object. So he convinced Louhi to send him \nhome and fetch the smith. Though the journey was far from easy, \nthe bard finally made it back to Kalevala. But Ilmarinen refused to go to the gloomy \nNorth— a land of witches and man-eaters. But keeping true to his word, Väinämöinen tricked Ilmarinen \ninto climbing a giant tree, before summoning a mighty storm \nto carry the smith all the way to Pohjola. Ilmarinen was well received in the North. Louhi lavished her guest with \nextravagant hospitality and promised him the hand \nof her beautiful daughter— if he could craft what she wished. When she finally asked if Ilmarinen \nwas capable of forging the Sampo, the powerful smith declared he could \nindeed accomplish the task. But try as he might to bend \nthe forge to his will, its fires only produced other artifacts— beautiful in appearance but \nill-mannered in nature. An elegant crossbow that \nthirsted for blood and a gleaming plow that ruined cultivated\nfields among others. Finally, Ilmarinen summoned the winds \nthemselves to work the bellows, and in three days time he \npulled the Sampo, with its lid of many colors from \nthe forge’s flames. On its sides the smith carefully crafted \na grain mill, a salt mill, and a money mill. Louhi was so delighted with the object’s \nlimitless productive power that she ran off to lock her treasure \ninside a mountain. But when Ilmarinen tried to \nclaim his prize, the promised maiden refused to marry him,\nand the smith had to return home alone. Years passed, and while \nPohjola prospered, Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen were without \nwives or great wealth. Bitter about this injustice, the bard \nproposed a quest to retrieve the Sampo, and the two sailed north with the \nhelp of Lemminkäinen— a beautiful young man with a history \nof starting trouble. Upon arrival, Väinämöinen requested half \nthe Sampo’s profits as compensation— or they’d take the artifact by force. Outraged at this request, Louhi summoned \nher forces to fight the heroes. But as her army readied for war, \nthe bard played his magic harp, Kantele, entrancing all who heard it and sending \nPohjola into a deep slumber. Unimpeded, the three men took the Sampo \nand quietly made their escape. Lemminkäinen was ecstatic \nat their success, and demanded that Väinämöinen sing \nof their triumph. The bard refused, knowing the dangers \nof celebrating too early. But after three days of traveling, \nLemminkäinen’s excitement overwhelmed him, and he recklessly broke out in song. His awful singing voice woke \na nearby crane, whose screeching cries roused \nthe Pohjolan horde. The army made chase. As their warship closed in, Väinämöinen \nraised a rock to breach their hull. Undeterred, Louhi transformed \ninto a giant eagle, carrying her army on her back as they \nattacked the heroes’ vessel. She managed to grab the Sampo \nin her claw, but just as quickly, it dropped into \nthe sea, shattering into pieces and sinking deep beyond her talon’s reach. Buried on the ocean floor, the remnants of this powerful device \nremain in the realm of Ahti, god of water— where they grind salt for the seas \nto this very day. "

        "text": "This is the tale of two ancient cities and the trees \nthat determined their destinies. In 3,000 BC Uruk was more densely \npopulated than modern day New York City. This crowded capital had to continually\nexpand their irrigation system to feed its growing population. 2,500 years later in Sri Lanka, the city \nof Anuradhapura had a similar problem. They were also growing constantly, and like Uruk, their city relied heavily \non an elaborate irrigation system. As Uruk grew, its farmers began chopping \ndown trees to make space for more crops. In Anuradhapura, however, \ntrees were sacred. Their city housed an offshoot \nof the Bodhi tree under which Buddha himself \nwas said to have attained enlightenment. Religious reverence \nslowed farmer’s axes and even led the city to plant \nadditional trees in urban parks. Initially, Uruk’s expansion worked well. But without trees to filter \ntheir water supply, Uruk’s irrigation system \nbecame contaminated. Evaporating water left mineral deposits, which rendered the soil \ntoo salty for agriculture. Conversely, Anuradhapura’s \nirrigation system was designed to work in concert with the surrounding forest. Their city eventually grew to more than \ntwice Uruk’s population, and today, Anuradhapura still cares \nfor a tree planted over 2,000 years ago. We may think of nature as being \nunconnected to our urban spaces, but trees have always been \nan essential part of successful cities. Trees act like a natural sponge, \nabsorbing storm water runoff before releasing it back \ninto the atmosphere. The webs of their roots protect against \nmudslides while allowing soil to retain water \nand filter out toxins. Roots help prevent floods, while reducing the need for storm \ndrains and water treatment plants. Their porous leaves purify the air \nby trapping carbon and other pollutants, making them essential \nin the fight against climate change. Humanity has been uncovering \nthese arboreal benefits for centuries. But trees aren’t just crucial \nto the health of a city’s infrastructure; they play a vital role in the health \nof its citizens as well. In the 1870’s, Manhattan had few trees \noutside the island’s parks. Without trees to provide shade, buildings absorbed up to nine times \nmore solar radiation during deadly summer heat waves. Combined with the period’s \npoor sanitation standards, the oppressive heat made the city a \nbreeding ground for bacteria like cholera. In modern day Hong Kong, tall skyscrapers\nand underground infrastructure make it difficult for trees to grow. This contributes to the city’s \ndangerously poor air quality, which can cause bronchitis \nand diminished lung function. Trees affect our mental health as well. Research indicates that the presence \nof green foliage increases attention spans and decreases stress levels. It’s even been shown that hospital \npatients with views of brick walls recover more slowly than \nthose with views of trees. Fortunately, many cities \nare full of views like this— and that’s no accident. As early as the 18th century, city planners began to embrace \nthe importance of urban trees. In 1733, Colonel James Oglethorpe \nplanned the city of Savannah, Georgia to ensure that no neighborhood \nwas more than a 2-minute walk from a park. After World War II, Copenhagen directed \nall new development along five arteries— each sandwiched between a park. This layout increased \nthe city’s resilience to pollution and natural disasters. And urban trees don’t just benefit people. Portland’s Forest Park preserves \nthe region’s natural biodiversity, making the city home to various \nlocal plants, 112 bird species, \nand 62 species of mammals. No city is more committed to trees \nthan Singapore. Since 1967, Singapore’s government\nhas planted over 1.2 million trees, including those within 50-meter tall \nvertical gardens called supertrees. These structures sustain themselves \nand nearby conservatories with solar energy and collected rainwater. Trees and vegetation currently cover \nover 50% of Singapore’s landmass, reducing the need for air conditioning and encouraging low-pollution \ntransportation. By 2050, it’s estimated that over 65% of\nthe world will be living in cities. City planners can lay an eco-friendly\nfoundation, but it’s up to the people who live \nin these urban forests to make them homes for more than humans. "

        "text": "Are you sleeping restlessly, feeling irritable or moody, forgetting little things, and feeling overwhelmed and isolated? Don't worry. We've all been there. You're probably just stressed out. Stress isn't always a bad thing. It can be handy for a burst of extra\nenergy and focus, like when you're playing \na competitive sport, or have to speak in public. But when its continuous, the kind most of us face day in\nand day out, it actually begins to change your brain. Chronic stress, like being overworked\nor having arguments at home, can affect brain size, its structure, and how it functions, right down to the level of your genes. Stress begins with something called the hypothalamus pituitary\nadrenal axis, a series of interactions between endocrine glands in the brain\nand on the kidney, which controls \nyour body's reaction to stress. When your brain detects \na stressful situation, your HPA axis is instantly activated and releases a hormone called cortisol,\nwhich primes your body for instant action. But high levels of cortisol \nover long periods of time wreak havoc on your brain. For example, chronic stress increases\nthe activity level and number of neural connections\nin the amygdala, your brain's fear center. And as levels of cortisol rise, electric signals in your hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with\nlearning, memories, and stress control, deteriorate. The hippocampus also inhibits\nthe activity of the HPA axis, so when it weakens, so does your ability \nto control your stress. That's not all, though. Cortisol can literally cause your brain\nto shrink in size. Too much of it results in the loss\nof synaptic connections between neurons and the shrinking \nof your prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain the regulates\nbehaviors like concentration, decision-making, judgement, and social interaction. It also leads to fewer new brain cells\nbeing made in the hippocampus. This means chronic stress \nmight make it harder for you to learn and remember things, and also set the stage for more serious\nmental problems, like depression\nand eventually Alzheimer's disease. The effects of stress may filter\nright down to your brain's DNA. An experiment showed that the amount of nurturing \na mother rat provides its newborn baby plays a part in determining how that baby\nresponds to stress later in life. The pups of nurturing moms turned out\nless sensitive to stress because their brains developed \nmore cortisol receptors, which stick to cortisol\nand dampen the stress response. The pups of negligent moms\nhad the opposite outcome, and so became more sensitive to stress\nthroughout life. These are considered epigenetic changes, meaning that they effect \nwhich genes are expressed without directly changing \nthe genetic code. And these changes can be reversed\nif the moms are swapped. But there's a surprising result. The epigenetic changes caused by\none single mother rat were passed down to many generations\nof rats after her. In other words, the results \nof these actions were inheritable. It's not all bad news, though. There are many ways to reverse\nwhat cortisol does to your stressed brain. The most powerful weapons are exercise\nand meditation, which involves breathing deeply and being aware \nand focused on your surroundings. Both of these activities \ndecrease your stress and increase the size of the hippocampus, thereby improving your memory. So don't feel defeated \nby the pressures of daily life. Get in control of your stress\nbefore it takes control of you. "

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We all start life as one single cell. Then that cell divides and we are two cells, then four, then eight. Cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form us. These cell divisions, by which we go from a single cell to 100 trillion cells, are called growth. And growth seems like a simple thing because when we think of it, we typically think of someone getting taller or, later in life, wider, but to cells, growth isn't simple. Cell division is an intricate chemical dance that's part individual, part community-driven. And in a neighborhood of 100 trillion cells, some times things go wrong. Maybe an individual cell's set of instructions, or DNA, gets a typo, what we call a mutation. Most of the time, the cell senses mistakes and shuts itself down, or the system detects a troublemaker and eliminates it. But, enough mutations can bypass the fail-safes, driving the cell to divide recklessly. That one rogue cell becomes two, then four, then eight. At every stage, the incorrect instructions are passed along to the cells' offspring. Weeks, months, or years after that one rogue cell transformed, you might see your doctor about a lump in your breast. Difficulty going to the bathroom could reveal a problem in your intestine, prostate, or bladder. Or, a routine blood test might count too many white cells or elevated liver enzymes. Your doctor delivers the bad news: it's cancer. From here your strategy will depend on where the cancer is and how far it's progressed. If the tumor is slow-growing and in one place, surgery might be all you need, if anything. If the tumor is fast-growing or invading nearby tissue, your doctor might recommend radiation or surgery followed by radiation. If the cancer has spread, or if it's inherently everywhere like a leukemia, your doctor will most likely recommend chemotherapy or a combination of radiation and chemo. Radiation and most forms of chemo work by physically shredding the cells' DNA or disrupting the copying machinery. But neither radiation nor chemotherapeutic drugs target only cancer cells. Radiation hits whatever you point it at, and your blood stream carries chemo-therapeutics all over your body. So, what happens when different cells get hit? Let's look at a healthy liver cell, a healthy hair cell, and a cancerous cell. The healthy liver cell divides only when it is stressed; the healthy hair cell divides frequently; and the cancer cell divides even more frequently and recklessly. When you take a chemotherapeutic drug, it will hit all of these cells. And remember that the drugs work typically by disrupting cell division. So, every time a cell divides, it opens itself up to attack, and that means the more frequently a cell divides, the more likely the drug is to kill it. So, remember that hair cell? It divides frequently and isn't a threat. And, there are other frequently dividing cells in your body like skin cells, gut cells, and blood cells. So the list of unpleasant side effects of cancer treatment parallels these tissue types: hair loss, skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, and pain. That makes sense because these are the cells that get hit the hardest. So, in the end, it is all about growth. Cancer hijacks cells' natural division machinery and forces them to put the pedal to the metal, growing rapidly and recklessly. But, using chemotherapeutic drugs, we take advantage of that aggressiveness, and we turn cancer's main strength into a weakness. "

        "text": "The supreme god, Óðinn, was exploring \nthe nine realms with his travel companions Hœnir, and the notoriously mischievous \nLoki. After a long journey, the three reached\na waterfall in Niðavellir, the subterranean land of the dwarves,\nand stopped for water. Óðinn and Hœnir were eager to meet\nHreiðmarr, the king of the dwarves, but Loki was bored and hungry. Spotting an otter nearby, \nLoki tossed a stone at its head, killing the animal. He kept its pelt and slouched\nafter the others. When they greeted Hreiðmarr,\nthe king paled, for the pelt belonged \nto none other than his shapeshifting son. Hreiðmarr summoned his two surviving sons,\nFáfnir and Regin, and bound the gods. He decided he would let them go \nin exchange for gold, as was the custom, but only if they could fill the otter pelt\nwith the finest gold until not even a hair was visible. Because of how the otter skin stretched, this meant procuring a nearly impossible \namount— but Loki had an idea. The dwarves were master craftspeople. One of them, Andvari, was said \nto forge marvelous creations. Andvari often took the form \nof a fish and, one day, he dove deeper than ever before— so deep he reached the land \nof the water nymphs, who guarded mounds of gold. At first, Andvari merely wanted to see \ntheir treasures for himself. But when the nymphs laughed\nat his awkward appearance, Andvari grew infuriated \nand seized their gold. With it, he crafted himself \na special ring. As long as he wore it, Andvari’s\nwealth would grow and grow. Loki saw Andvari’s riches as \nthe perfect solution to their problem. He returned to the waterfall, \nconjured a huge net, and extracted a wriggling fish. As Andvari squirmed, \nLoki jeered that he’d kill him unless he handed over his treasure. Andvari directed Loki to his lair. Satisfied with the heaps\nof gold he saw there, Loki freed Andvari— but a sudden glint off of one \nof the dwarf’s fingers alerted Loki that he’d missed \nthe most powerful treasure of all. Despite Andvari’s pleas, \nLoki tore the ring away. Seething, Andvari cursed the ring, declaring that it would be the doom\nof all its subsequent owners. Back at the palace, Andvari’s gold appeared\nto completely cover the otter skin. But as Hreiðmarr inspected the pelt, he saw a single, bare whisker peeking out. So, the gods relinquished the ring. As Hreiðmarr slipped it onto his finger, Regin shuddered at the greed \nin his father’s eyes, while his brother, Fáfnir, \nlooked on in envy. Later, when Fáfnir demanded \nthat the king share the wealth, Hreiðmarr refused. So, Fáfnir killed his father, pried the coveted ring from his finger,\nand fled the palace with the treasure. He came to rest in a cave where he curled\naround his new possessions. The ring warped him inside and out,\nand over time, Fáfnir morphed into a gruesome dragon. Meanwhile, Fáfnir’s betrayal and guarded\ntreasure bore into Regin’s mind. He finally enlisted the help of his loyal\nfoster son, a warrior named Sigurd, to slay the monster his brother \nhad become. Sigurd did as instructed. Afterwards, Regin asked Sigurd to roast \nthe beast’s heart so he could consume it. Sigurd obeyed and tasted the heart’s\nblood before serving him. But as soon as the liquid\nmet Sigurd’s tongue, he understood the chatter \nof the surrounding birds. They were singing of but one thing:\nRegin was going to kill him. So, Sigurd slayed Regin \nand seized the wealth for himself. This was only the beginning. Over the coming years, the ring\nwould tear families apart, doom lovers, and empower, then ultimately destroy, \nany who had it in their possession. Andvari’s curse set a vicious cycle \nin motion that would consume many lives— and inspire some of the most influential \nworks of the 19th and 20th centuries. "

        "text": "The Earth intercepts a lot of solar power: 173 thousand terawatts. That's ten thousand times more power\nthan the planet's population uses. So is it possible that one day the world could be completely \nreliant on solar energy? To answer that question, we first need to examine how solar panels\nconvert solar energy to electrical energy. Solar panels are made up of smaller units\ncalled solar cells. The most common solar cells\nare made from silicon, a semiconductor that is the second\nmost abundant element on Earth. In a solar cell, crystalline silicon is sandwiched\nbetween conductive layers. Each silicon atom is connected\nto its neighbors by four strong bonds, which keep the electrons in place\nso no current can flow. Here's the key: a silicon solar cell uses\ntwo different layers of silicon. An n-type silicon has extra electrons, and p-type silicon has extra spaces\nfor electrons, called holes. Where the two types of silicon meet, electrons can wander across \nthe p/n junction, leaving a positive charge on one side and creating negative charge on the other. You can think of light \nas the flow of tiny particles called photons, shooting out from the Sun. When one of these photons strikes\nthe silicon cell with enough energy, it can knock an electron from its bond,\nleaving a hole. The negatively charged electron and\nlocation of the positively charged hole are now free to move around. But because of the electric field\nat the p/n junction, they'll only go one way. The electron is drawn to the n-side, while the hole is drawn to the p-side. The mobile electrons are collected by\nthin metal fingers at the top of the cell. From there, they flow through \nan external circuit, doing electrical work, like powering a lightbulb, before returning through the conductive\naluminum sheet on the back. Each silicon cell only puts out\nhalf a volt, but you can string them \ntogether in modules to get more power. Twelve photovoltaic cells are enough\nto charge a cellphone, while it takes many modules \nto power an entire house. Electrons are the only moving parts\nin a solar cell, and they all go back where they came from. There's nothing to get worn out\nor used up, so solar cells can last for decades. So what's stopping us from being\ncompletely reliant on solar power? There are political factors at play, not to mention businesses that lobby\nto maintain the status quo. But for now, let's focus on the physical\nand logistical challenges, and the most obvious of those is that solar energy \nis unevenly distributed across the planet. Some areas are sunnier than others. It's also inconsistent. Less solar energy is available \non cloudy days or at night. So a total reliance would require efficient ways to get electricity \nfrom sunny spots to cloudy ones, and effective storage of energy. The efficiency of the cell itself\nis a challenge, too. If sunlight is reflected \ninstead of absorbed, or if dislodged electrons fall back into\na hole before going through the circuit, that photon's energy is lost. The most efficient solar cell yet still only converts 46% of \nthe available sunlight to electricity, and most commercial systems are currently\n15-20% efficient. In spite of these limitations, it actually would be possible to power the entire world \nwith today's solar technology. We'd need the funding \nto build the infrastructure and a good deal of space. Estimates range from tens \nto hundreds of thousands of square miles, which seems like a lot, but the Sahara Desert alone is over\n3 million square miles in area. Meanwhile, solar cells are getting\nbetter, cheaper, and are competing \nwith electricity from the grid. And innovations, like floating solar farms,\nmay change the landscape entirely. Thought experiments aside, there's the fact \nthat over a billion people don't have access \nto a reliable electric grid, especially in developing countries, many of which are sunny. So in places like that, solar energy is already much cheaper\nand safer than available alternatives, like kerosene. For say, Finland or Seattle, though, effective solar energy \nmay still be a little way off. "

        "text": "On their 20th birthday, identical twin \nastronauts volunteer for an experiment. Terra will remain on Earth, while Stella \nwill board a spaceship. Stella’s ship will travel at 86.6% the \nspeed of light to visit a star that is 10 \nlight-years away, then return to Earth at the same speed. As they prepare to part ways, the twins wonder what will happen \nwhen they’re reunited. Since a light year is exactly the distance\nlight can travel in a year, Stella’s journey should take 23 years. But from having studied \nspecial relativity, the twins know it’s not that simple. First of all, the faster an object moves \nthrough space, the slower it moves through time \ncompared to an unmoving observer. This relationship can be quantified with \nsomething called the Lorentz factor, which is defined by this equation. And secondly, the length of a moving \nobject as measured by an observer at rest will contract by the same factor. At 86.6% of the speed of light \nthe Lorentz factor is 2, meaning time will pass twice as slowly \naboard the spaceship. Of course, Stella won’t notice \ntime slowing down. That’s because all time-based processes \nin the ship will slow down as well– clocks and electrical devices; Stella’s biological activities including \nher rate of aging and her perception of time itself. The only people who could notice time\non the moving spaceship passing slower for Stella would be observers in an inertial, \nor non-accelerating, reference frame– like Terra back on Earth. Thus, Terra concludes that when they meet\nback on Earth, she’ll be older than Stella. But that’s just one way of \nlooking at things. Because all movement is relative, Stella argues it would be just as valid to\nsay her spaceship will stand still while the rest of the universe, \nincluding Terra, moves around her. And in that case, time will pass twice as \nslowly for Terra, making Stella the older twin in the end. They can’t each be older than the other, \nso which one of them is right? This apparent contradiction is known as\nthe “Twin Paradox.” But it’s not really a paradox– just an example of how special relativity \ncan be easily misunderstood. To test their theories in real-time, each of the twins agrees to send \na burst of light to the other every time a year has passed for them. Unlike other objects, the speed of light \nis always constant regardless of an observer’s \nreference frame. A light burst sent from Earth will be \nmeasured at the same speed as a light burst sent from the spaceship, regardless of whether it’s on its \noutbound or return trip. So when one twin observes \na burst of light, they’re measuring how long it took the \nother twin to experience a year passing, plus how long it took for light \nto travel between them. We can track what’s happening on a graph. The X axis marks distance from Earth, \nand the Y axis tracks the passage of time. From Terra’s perspective, her path will \nsimply be a vertical line, with distance equal to zero and each tick on the line equivalent \nto a year as she perceives it. Stella’s path will stretch from the same \norigin to a point 11.5 years in time and 10 light-years in distance from Terra… before converging again at zero \ndistance and 23 years’ time. At her first one-year mark, Terra will send a pulse of light from \nEarth towards Stella’s spaceship. Since light takes a year to travel \none light-year, its path will be a 45-degree \ndiagonal line. And because Stella is \ntraveling away from it, by the time the light catches up to her, over 7 total years will have passed for\nTerra, and over 4 for Stella. By the time Stella observes \nTerra’s second burst, she will already be on her return journey. But now, since she’s moving towards the \nsource of the light, it will take less time to reach her, and she’ll observe the bursts \nmore frequently. This means that Stella observes Terra \naging slowly for the first half of her journey, but aging rapidly during the return half. Meanwhile for Stella, it seems as though \nTerra, the destination star, and the whole universe are \nmoving around her. And because of length contraction, Stella observes the distance between \nthem shrinking by a factor of 2. This means each leg of the trip will only \ntake about six years from Stella’s perspective. When she sends the first signal to Earth, \ntwo years will have passed for Terra. Stella will send four more light bursts \nduring her outbound journey, each one from farther away. By the time Terra observes the first pulse\nfrom Stella's inbound journey, over 21 years will have passed for her. For the rest of Stella's return home, Terra receives multiple light \nbursts each year. Thus, Terra observes Stella aging slowly \nfor about 90% of their 23 years apart, and aging rapidly during the last 10%. This asymmetry accounts for why the \nparadox isn’t really a paradox. Although each twin witnesses time both speeding up and slowing \ndown for the other, Stella sees an even split, while Terra sees Stella aging slowly for \nmost of the time they’re apart. This is consistent with each twin’s \nmeasurement of the space voyage, which takes 23 Earth years, but only \n11.5 as experienced aboard the ship. When the twins are reunited, Terra will be\n43 years old, while Stella will be 31. Where Stella went wrong was her assumption that she and Terra had\nequal claim to being inertial observers. To be an inertial observer, one has to \nmaintain a constant speed and direction relative to the rest of the universe. Terra was at rest the entire time, \nso her velocity was a constant zero. But when Stella changed her direction \nfor the return journey, she entered a different reference frame \nfrom the one she’d started in. Terra and Stella now both have a better\nunderstanding of how spacetime works. And as twins who are eleven \nyears apart in age, they’re a perfect example \nof special relativity. "

Unfortunately, you've all been captured\nby the tyrannical rulers and brought to the ancient colosseum\nfor their deadly entertainment. Before you're thrown into the dungeon, you see many numbered hallways\nleading outside. But each exit is blocked by \nan electric barrier with a combination keypad. You learn that one of you will be allowed\nto try to escape by passing a challenge while everyone else will be fed to\nthe mutant salamanders the next morning. With her perfect logical reasoning,\nZara is the obvious choice. You hand her a concealed audio transmitter\nso that the rest of you can listen along. As Zara is led away, you hear her footsteps echo \nthrough one of the hallways, then stop. A voice announces \nthat she must enter a code consisting of three positive whole numbers\nin ascending order, so the second number is greater than\nor equal to the first, and the third is greater than\nor equal to the second. She may ask for up to three clues, but if she makes a wrong guess, or says anything else, she'll be thrown back into the dungeon. For the first clue, the voice says\nthe product of the three numbers is 36. When Zara asks for the second clue, it tells her the sum of the numbers is the same as the number \nof the hallway she entered. There's a long silence. You're sure Zara remembers \nthe hallway number, but there's no way for you to know it, and she can't say it outloud. If Zara could enter the passcode \nat this point, she would, but instead, she asks for the third clue, and the voice announces that the largest\nnumber appears only once in the combination. Moments later, the buzz of the electric\nbarrier stops for a few seconds, and you realize that Zara has escaped. Unfortunately, her transmitter \nis no longer in range, so that's all the information you get. Can you find the solution? Pause on the next screen\nto work out the solution. 3 2 1 You're worried about the fact that you\ndon't know Zara's hallway number, but you decide to start \nfrom the beginning anyways. From the first clue, you work out all of\nthe eight possible combinations that come out to a product of 36. One of these must be right,\nbut which one? Now comes the hard part. Even though you don't know which number\nyou're looking for, you decide to work out the sum\nof each combination's three numbers. That's when it hits you. All but two of the sums are unique, and if the hallway number had matched\nany of these, Zara would have known the correct\ncombination right then and there without asking for the third clue. Since she did ask for the clue, the hallway number must have \nmatched the only sum that appears more than once in the list: thirteen. But which of the two combinations\nthat add up to thirteen is correct: 1,6,6, or 2,2,9? That's where the third clue comes in. Since it tells us that the largest\nnumber must be unique, 2,2,9 must be the code. When night falls, you and the others\nescape through hallway thirteen and rejoin Zara outside. You've freed yourselves through \nmath and logic. Now it's time to free \nthe rest of the world. "

        "text": "\"War and Peace,\" a tome, a slog, the sort of book you shouldn't read in bed\nbecause if you fall asleep, it could give you a concussion, right? Only partly. \"War and Peace\" is a long book, sure, but it's also a thrilling examination\nof history, populated with some of the deepest, most\nrealistic characters you'll find anywhere. And if its length intimidates you,\njust image how poor Tolstoy felt. In 1863, he set out to write a short novel\nabout a political dissident returning from exile in Siberia. Five years later, he had produced\na 1,200 page epic featuring love stories, battlefields, bankruptcies, firing squads, religious visions, the burning of Moscow, and a semi-domesticated bear, but no exile and no political dissidents. Here's how it happened. Tolstoy, a volcanic soul, was born to a famously eccentric \naristocratic family in 1828. By the time he was 30, he had already\ndropped out of Kazan University, gambled away the family fortune, joined the army, written memoirs, and rejected the literary establishment\nto travel Europe. He then settled into Yasnaya Polyana,\nhis ancestral mansion, to write about the return \nof the Decembrists, a band of well-born revolutionaries\npardoned in 1856 after 30 years in exile. But, Tolstoy thought, how could he tell the story \nof the Decembrists return from exile without telling the story of 1825, when they revolted against \nthe conservative Tsar Nicholas I? And how could he do that without telling\nthe story of 1812, when Napoleon's disastrous \ninvasion of Russia helped trigger the authoritarianism\nthe Decembrists were rebelling against? And how could he tell the story of 1812\nwithout talking about 1805, when the Russians first learned of\nthe threat Napoleon posed after their defeat at \nthe Battle of Austerlitz? So Tolstoy began writing, both about the big events of history and the small lives \nthat inhabit those events. He focused on aristocrats,\nthe class he knew best. The book only occasionally touches on the lives of the vast majority \nof the Russian population, who were peasants,\nor even serfs, farmers bound to serve the owners\nof the land on which they lived. \"War and Peace\" opens on the eve\nof war between France and Russia. Aristocrats at a cocktail party fret\nabout the looming violence, but then change the topic to those things\naristocrats always seem to care about: money, sex, and death. This first scene is indicative of the way the book bounces \nbetween the political and personal over an ever-widening canvas. There are no main characters\nin \"War and Peace.\" Instead, readers enter\na vast interlocking web of relationships and questions. Will the hapless \nand illegitimate son of a count marry a beautiful but conniving princess? Will his only friend survive\nthe battlefields of Austria? And what about that nice young girl\nfalling in love with both men at once? Real historical figures mix and mingle\nwith all these fictional folk, Napoleon appears several times, and even one of Tolstoy's ancestors\nplays a background part. But while the characters \nand their psychologies are gripping, Tolstoy is not afraid to interrupt \nthe narrative to pose insightful \nquestions about history. Why do wars start? What are good battlefield tactics? Do nations rise and fall on the actions\nof so-called great men like Napoleon, or are there larger cultural and economic\nforces at play? These extended digressions are part \nof what make \"War and Peace\" so panoramic in scope. But for some 19th century critics, this meant \"War and Peace\" barely felt\nlike a novel at all. It was a \"large, loose, baggy monster,\"\nin the words of Henry James. Tolstoy, in fact, agreed. To him, novels were \na western European form. Russian writers had to write differently\nbecause Russian people lived differently. \"What is 'War and Peace'?\" he asked. \"It is not a novel. Still less an epic poem. Still less a historical chronicle. 'War and Peace' is what the author wanted\nand was able to express in the form in which it was expressed.\" It is, in other words, the sum total\nof Tolstoy's imaginative powers, and nothing less. By the time \"War and Peace\" ends, Tolstoy has brought his characters\nto the year 1820, 36 years before the events he originally\nhoped to write about. In trying to understand his own times, he had become immersed in the years\npiled up behind him. The result is a grand interrogation\ninto history, culture, philosophy, psychology, and the human response to war. "

        "text": "OK, today we're going\nto talk about the mole. Now, I know what you're thinking:\n\"I know what a mole is, it's a small furry creature that digs holes\nin the ground and destroys gardens.\" And some of you might be thinking that it's a growth\non your aunt's face with hairs sticking out of it. Well, in this case, a mole is a concept\nthat we use in chemistry to count molecules, atoms, just about anything\nextremely small. Have you ever wondered how many atoms\nthere are in the universe? Or in your body? Or\neven in a grain of sand? Scientists have wanted\nto answer that question, but how do you count something\nas small as an atom? Well, in 1811, someone had an idea\nthat if you had equal volumes of gases, at the same\ntemperature and pressure, they would contain an equal\nnumber of particles. His name was Lorenzo Romano\nAmedeo Carlo Avogadro. I wonder how long it took\nhim to sign autographs. Unfortunately for Avogadro, most scientists\ndidn't accept the idea of the atom, and there was no way\nto prove he was right. There was no clear difference\nbetween atoms and molecules. Most scientists looked at Avogadro's work\nas purely hypothetical, and didn't give it much thought. But it turned out he was right!\nBy late 1860, Avogadro was proven correct,\nand his work helped lay the foundation for the atomic theory. Unfortunately,\nAvogadro died in 1856. Now the thing is that the amount\nof particles in even small samples is tremendous. For example, If you have a balloon of any gas\nat zero degrees Celcius, and at a pressure of one atmosphere,\nthen you have precisely six hundred and two sextillion\ngas particles. That is, you have six with 23 zeros\nafter it particles of gas in the container. Or in scientific notation, 6.02\ntimes 10 to the 23rd particles. This example is a little misleading, because gases take up a lot of space\ndue to the high kinetic energy of the gas particles, and it leaves you\nthinking atoms are bigger than they really are. Instead, think of water molecules. If you pour 18.01 grams\nof water into a glass, which is 18.01 milliliters,\nwhich is like three and a half teaspoons of water, you'll have 602 sextillion\nmolecules of water. Since Lorenzo Romano - uh, never mind - Avogadro\nwas the first one to come up with this idea, scientists named the number 6.02\ntimes 10 to the 23rd after him. It is simply known as Avogadros's number. Now, back to the mole. Not that mole. This mole. Yep, this\nnumber has a second name. The mole. Chemists use the term mole to refer to the quantities\nthat are at the magnitude of 602 sextillion. This is known as a molar quantity. Atoms and molecules are so small, that chemists\nhave bundled them into groups called moles. Moles are hard for students to understand\nbecause they have a hard time picturing the size of a mole, or of 602 sextillion. It's just too big to wrap\nour brains around. Remember our 18.01 milliliters of water? Well, that's a mole of water. But how much is that? Exactly what does 602\nsextillion look like? Maybe this'll help. Exchange the water particles for donuts. If you had a mole of donuts,\nthey would cover the entire earth to a depth of eight kilometers, which is about five miles. You really need a lot of coffee for that. If you had a mole of basketballs,\nyou could create a new planet the size of the earth. If you received a mole of pennies on the day\nyou were born and spent a million dollars a second until the day you died at the age\nof 100, you would still have more than 99.99% of your money in the bank. OK. Now we sort of have an idea\nhow large the mole is. So how do we use it? You might be surprised to know\nthat chemists use it the same way you use pounds to buy\ngrapes, deli meat, or eggs. When you go to the grocery store,\nyou don't go to the deli counter and ask for 43 slices of salami,\nyou buy your salami by the pound. When you buy your eggs,\nyou buy a dozen eggs. When we hear the word dozen,\nwe probably think of the number 12. We also know that a pair is two, a baker's dozen is 13, a gross is 144, and a ream\nof paper is - anybody? A ream is 500. Well, a mole is really the same thing. For a chemist, a mole conjures\nup the number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd, not a fuzzy little animal.\nThe only difference is that the other quantities\nare more familiar to us. So there you have it -\nthe story of the mole, Avogadro, basketballs, and how to buy\nsalami at the grocery store. "

        "text": "In 1987, tens of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia \nfor the annual Hajj pilgrimage. But what started out as a celebration \nled to a health crisis: just a few days after the pilgrimage, more than 2,000 cases \nof meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia\nand the rest of the world. The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a\nwave of deadly meningitis epidemics that ultimately infected tens of\nthousands of people worldwide. Meningitis is the inflammation \nof the meninges, three tissue layers responsible for \nprotecting the brain and spinal cord. What makes meningitis so dangerous\ncompared to other diseases is the sheer speed with which\nit invades a person’s body. In the worst cases, it causes death \nwithin a day. Fortunately, that’s rare for patients\nwho receive early medical treatment. The disease primarily \ncomes in three forms: fungal, viral, and bacterial--\nthe last being the most deadly by far, and what we’ll focus on. People usually contract bacterial \nmeningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and \nsaliva that spray into the air when an infected person \nsneezes or coughs. It can also be transmitted \nthrough kissing, or sharing cigarettes, \ntoothbrushes or utensils. Some people can be infected \nand carry the disease without showing symptoms\nor getting sick, which helps the disease\nspread quickly to others. Once the bacteria enter \nthe nose, mouth, and throat, they cross the surrounding \nmembranes and enter the bloodstream. From there, bacteria have \nrapid access to the body’s tissues --including a membrane\ncalled the blood-brain barrier. This is made of a tight mesh of cells which\nseparate blood vessels from the brain, and block everything except\nfor a specific set of particles, including water molecules and some gases. But in ways that scientists are \nstill trying to understand, meningitis bacteria can trick\nthe barrier into letting them through. Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly\ninfect the meninges. This triggers inflammation as the body’s \nimmune response kicks into overdrive, bringing on fever\nand intense headaches. As swelling in the meninges worsens,\nthe neck begins to stiffen. Swelling in the brain disrupts its\nnormal function-- causing symptoms like hearing loss \nand extreme light sensitivity. As pressure increases in the cranium, \nit may also make the person confused-- one of the hallmarks\nof the disease. A few hours in, the rapidly multiplying\nbacteria start to release toxins, leading to septicemia,\nalso known as blood poisoning. This breaks down blood vessels, letting blood seep out and form what\nstarts out looking like a rash, and evolves into big discoloured blots \nbeneath the skin. At the same time, these toxins\nburn through oxygen in the blood, reducing the amount that gets to \nmajor organs like the lungs and kidneys. That increases the chance \nof organ shut down --and alongside spreading \nsepticemia, threatens death. That all sounds scary, but doctors are so\ngood at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can drastically\nreduce an adult’s risk of dying from it. The longer it’s left \nuntreated, though, the more likely it will lead\nto lasting damage. If declining oxygen levels cause cell\ndeath in extreme parts of the body --like fingers, toes, arms and legs--\nthe risk of amputation goes up. And if bacterial toxins accumulate\nin the brain and trigger cell death, meningitis could also cause long-term\nbrain damage and memory loss. So fast treatment, or better yet, \nprevention, is critical. That's why most countries have\nvaccines that defend against the disease in its deadliest forms. Those are usually given to the people who\nare most at risk--like young children, people with weak immune systems, \nor people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis \ncould potentially happen. In addition to those gatherings, meningitis is most common in\na region called the meningitis belt that stretches across Africa, though cases\ndo happen all over the world. If you’re concerned that you or someone \nyou know may have meningitis, get to the doctor as soon as possible; quick action could save your life. "

        "text": "After witnessing the violent rage\nshown by babies whenever deprived of an item\nthey considered their own, Jean Piaget, a founding father\nof child psychology, observed something profound\nabout human nature. Our sense of ownership emerges\nincredibly early. Why are we so clingy? There's a well-established phenomenon\nin psychology known as the endowment effect where we value items much more highly\njust as soon as we own them. In one famous demonstration, students were given a choice\nbetween a coffee mug or a Swiss chocolate bar as a reward for helping out with research. Half chose the mug,\nand half chose the chocolate. That is, they seemed to value\nthe two rewards similarly. Other students were given a mug first and then a surprise chance to swap it\nfor a chocolate bar, but only 11% wanted to. Yet another group \nstarted out with chocolate, and most preferred to keep it\nrather than swap. In other words, the students nearly\nalways put greater value on whichever reward they started out with. Part of this has to do with how quickly\nwe form connections between our sense of self\nand the things we consider ours. That can even be seen at the neural level. In one experiment, neuroscientists scanned\nparticipants' brains while they allocated various objects\neither to a basket labeled \"mine,\" or another labeled, \"Alex's.\" When participants subsequently looked at\ntheir new things, their brains showed more activity in a region that usually \nflickers into life whenever we think about ourselves. Another reason we're so fond\nof our possessions is that from a young age\nwe believe they have a unique essence. Psychologists showed us this by using\nan illusion to convince three to six-year-olds\nthey built a copying machine, a device that could create perfect\nreplicas of any item. When offered a choice between \ntheir favorite toy or an apparently exact copy, the majority of the children\nfavored the original. In fact, they were often horrified\nat the prospect of taking home a copy. This magical thinking about objects\nisn't something we grow out of. Rather it persists into adulthood\nwhile becoming ever more elaborate. For example, consider the huge value\nplaced on items that have been owned by celebrities. It's as if the buyers believed the objects\nthey'd purchased were somehow imbued with the essence\nof their former celebrity owners. For similar reasons, many of us are\nreluctant to part with family heirlooms which help us feel connected\nto lost loved ones. These beliefs can even alter \nour perception of the physical world and change our athletic abilities. Participants in a recent study were told\nthey were using a golf putter once owned by the champion Ben Curtis. During the experiment, they perceived the hole as being \nabout a centimeter larger than controlled participants \nusing a standard putter and they sank slightly more putts. Although feelings of ownership emerge\nearly in life, culture also plays a part. For example, it was recently discovered\nthat Hadza people of northern Tanzania who are isolated from modern culture don't exhibit the endowment effect. That's possibly because they live\nin an egalitarian society where almost everything is shared. At the other extreme, sometimes our\nattachment to our things can go too far. Part of the cause of hoarding disorder\nis an exaggerated sense of responsibility and protectiveness \ntoward one's belongings. That's why people with this condition find\nit so difficult to throw anything away. What remains to be seen today is how the nature of our relationship\nwith our possessions will change with the rise \nof digital technologies. Many have forecast the demise\nof physical books and music, but for now, at least, \nthis seems premature. Perhaps there will always be something\nuniquely satisfying about holding an object in our hands\nand calling it our own. "

        "text": "Created by logician Raymond Smullyan and popularized by his colleague\nGeorge Boolos, this riddle has been called the hardest\nlogic puzzle ever. You and your team have crash-landed\non an ancient planet. The only way off is to appease\nits three alien overlords, Tee, Eff, and Arr, by giving them the correct artifacts. Unfortunately, you don't\nknow who is who. From an inscription, you learn that you\nmay ask three yes or no questions, each addressed to any one lord. Tee's answers are always true, Eff's are always false, and Arr's answer is random each time. But there's a problem. You've deciphered the language enough\nto ask any question, but you don't know which of the two\nwords 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes and which means no. How can you still figure out \nwhich alien is which? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1 At first, this puzzle seems not just hard,\nbut downright impossible. What good is asking a question if you can neither understand the answer\nnor know if it's true? But it can be done. The key is to carefully formulate\nour questions so that any answer \nyields useful information. First of all, we can get around\nto not knowing what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean by including the words themselves\nin the questions, and secondly, if we load each question\nwith a hypothetical condition, whether an alien is lying or not\nwon't actually matter. To see how that could work, imagine our question\nis whether two plus two is four. Instead of posing it directly, we say, \"If I asked you whether\ntwo plus two is four, would you answer 'ozo'?\" If 'ozo' means yes \nand the overlord is Tee, it truthfully replies, \"ozo.\" But what if we ask Eff? Well, it would answer \"ulu,\"\nor no to the embedded question, so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead. And if 'ozo' actually means no, then the answer to \nour embedded question is 'ulu,' and both Tee and Eff still reply 'ozo,' each for their own reasons. If you're confused about why this works, the reason involves logical structure. A double positive and a double negative\nboth result in a positive. Now, we can be sure that asking\neither Tee or Eff a question put this way will yield 'ozo'\nif the hypothetical question is true and 'ulu' if it's false regardless of what \neach word actually means. Unfortunately, \nthis doesn't help us with Arr. But don't worry, we can use our first\nquestion to identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr. Then we can use the second to find out\nwhether its Tee or Eff. And once we know that, we can ask it to identify \none of the others. So let's begin. Ask the alien in the middle, \"If I asked you whether the overlord on\nmy left is Arr, would you answer 'ozo'?\" If the reply is 'ozo,' \nthere are two possibilities. You could already be talking to Arr,\nin which case the answer is meaningless. But otherwise, you're talking to either\nTee or Eff, and as we know, getting 'ozo' from either one means \nyour hypothetical question was correct, and the left overlord is indeed Arr. Either way, you can be sure the alien\non the right is not Arr. Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,' then you know the alien \non the left can't be Arr. Now go to the overlord you've determined\nisn't Arr and ask, \"If I asked 'are you Eff?' \nwould you answer 'ozo'?\" Since you don't have to worry about\nthe random possibility, either answer will \nestablish its identity. Now that you know whether its\nanswers are true or false, ask the same alien whether the center\noverlord is Arr. The process of elimination will identify\nthe remaining one. The satisfied overlords help you\nrepair your ship and you prepare for takeoff. Allowed one final question, you ask\nTee if it's a long way to Earth, and he answers \"ozo.\" Too bad you still don't know \nwhat that means. "

        "text": "Cigarettes aren’t good for us. That’s hardly news--we’ve known \nabout the dangers of smoking for decades. But how exactly do cigarettes harm us? Let’s look at what happens \nas their ingredients make their way through our bodies, and how we benefit physically \nwhen we finally give up smoking. With each inhalation, smoke brings its more than 5,000 \nchemical substances into contact with the body’s tissues. From the start, tar, \na black, resinous material, begins to coat the teeth and gums, damaging tooth enamel, \nand eventually causing decay. Over time, smoke also damages \nnerve-endings in the nose, causing loss of smell. Inside the airways and lungs, smoke increases \nthe likelihood of infections, as well as chronic diseases\nlike bronchitis and emphysema. It does this by damaging the cilia, tiny hairlike structures whose job it is \nto keep the airways clean. It then fills the alveoli, tiny air sacs that enable the exchange \nof oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and blood. A toxic gas called carbon monoxide \ncrosses that membrane into the blood, binding to hemoglobin and displacing the oxygen it would usually have transported\naround the body. That’s one of the reasons smoking \ncan lead to oxygen deprivation and shortness of breath. Within about 10 seconds, the bloodstream carries a stimulant \ncalled nicotine to the brain, triggering the release of dopamine \nand other neurotransmitters including endorphins that create the pleasurable sensations \nwhich make smoking highly addictive. Nicotine and other chemicals \nfrom the cigarette simultaneously cause constriction \nof blood vessels and damage their delicate \nendothelial lining, restricting blood flow. These vascular effects lead \nto thickening of blood vessel walls and enhance blood platelet stickiness, increasing the likelihood \nthat clots will form and trigger heart attacks and strokes. Many of the chemicals inside cigarettes \ncan trigger dangerous mutations in the body’s DNA that make cancers form. Additionally, ingredients like arsenic \nand nickel may disrupt the process of DNA repair, thus compromising the body’s ability \nto fight many cancers. In fact, about one of every three \ncancer deaths in the United States is caused by smoking. And it’s not just lung cancer. Smoking can cause cancer \nin multiple tissues and organs, as well as damaged eyesight and weakened bones. It makes it harder \nfor women to get pregnant. And in men,\nit can cause erectile dysfunction. But for those who quit smoking, there’s a huge positive upside with almost immediate \nand long-lasting physical benefits. Just 20 minutes after \na smoker’s final cigarette, their heart rate and blood pressure\nbegin to return to normal. After 12 hours, \ncarbon monoxide levels stabilize, increasing the blood’s \noxygen-carrying capacity. A day after ceasing, heart attack risk begins to decrease as\nblood pressure and heart rates normalize. After two days, the nerve endings responsible \nfor smell and taste start to recover. Lungs become healthier \nafter about one month, with less coughing \nand shortness of breath. The delicate hair-like cilia \nin the airways and lungs start recovering within weeks, and are restored after 9 months, \nimproving resistance to infection. By the one-year anniversary of quitting, heart disease risk plummets to half\nas blood vessel function improves. Five years in, the chance of a clot forming\ndramatically declines, and the risk of stroke \ncontinues to reduce. After ten years, the chances \nof developing fatal lung cancer go down by 50%, probably because the body’s ability \nto repair DNA is once again restored. Fifteen years in, the likelihood \nof developing coronary heart disease is essentially the same \nas that of a non-smoker. There’s no point pretending \nthis is all easy to achieve. Quitting can lead to anxiety \nand depression, resulting from nicotine withdrawal. But fortunately, \nsuch effects are usually temporary. And quitting is getting easier,\nthanks to a growing arsenal of tools. Nicotine replacement therapy through gum, skin patches, lozenges, and sprays may help wean smokers off cigarettes. They work by stimulating \nnicotine receptors in the brain and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms, without the addition \nof other harmful chemicals. Counselling and support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy, and moderate intensity exercise also help smokers stay cigarette-free. That’s good news, since quitting puts you and your body \non the path back to health. "

        "text": "Once every century, the world’s greatest\nspiders gather to compete in a series of grueling games. The winner will become \nthe next arachnomonarch, able to command all the world’s spiders\nto their will. That day is today, and for the first time, you’re casting your name into the ring. From Anansi to Arachne to Aragog, all of the titans of the\nspider world are here, and at first, no one even notices \nitsy-bitsy you. But after wowing the crowd \nwith your web design and sticking it to the competition \nin the long-distance sling, you’ve qualified for the finals. Now all that remains is to face off \nagainst the reigning champion, Queen Shelob, on the Whirled Wide Web,\nand win the title from her. The web stretches over a large chasm, with intersecting strands coming \nto a single point on the other side. Moving across each strand\nrequires a careful dash, and you must keep going until\nyou stop at the next hub where two strands cross. By ancient spider code, only one \ncompetitor may traverse the web at a time. You must take turns, moving from one\nintersection to an adjacent one. No one may spin new paths \ninto existence or skip turns. You begin two spaces from Shelob,\nand to win, you must catch her by your tenth move. Can you attain the mantle\nof spider supremacy? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s tempting to trap Shelob in a corner,\nbut doing so is surprisingly tricky. The layout of the web \nis such that every move you make, Shelob can get to another intersection\ntwo away from you. So even if you were to drive her \ninto a corner, she’d escape it easily. There are no dead ends, so there’s never a situation where she’d \nbe forced to move to your space. However, there is this point up here\nwhere all the strands converge. It's easy to see that it's important, but the challenge is figuring out\nexactly what to do with it. There’s a clever way of re-visualizing\nthe problem: try coloring every intersection \none of two colors— say red and blue— where the same color never borders itself. What you get is a checkerboard pattern, then one space at the point\nwhich you can’t make either color. At the beginning of the game, \nevery time you move to red, Shelob will be on blue, and every time you move to blue, \nShelob will be on red. In other words, unless something changes, you can never move onto the same \nintersection as her. And that’s where the point comes in. As indicated by its unique color, it’s the\none place you can break the pattern and change the rhythm of moves. So you should waste\nno time in getting up there. Shelob could now be in any one \nof these red spaces, and you have at most 6 moves\nleft to catch her. But thanks to the colors we've added, we can now focus on the one thing\nthat matters the most: changing the color pattern. Shelob is on red, so you should move \nonto red on the second or fourth strand. Now, Shelob can never move to any\nof the spots neighboring you, giving you a kind of net\nto use to catch her. You may have luck choosing your moves\nthrough intuition at this point. But if you want to get\nalgorithmic about it, you could track how far away she is \nhorizontally and vertically, as two numbers. On your move, \nshrink the larger of the two, and no matter which direction she runs,\nshe’ll have to hit an edge. Eventually, you'll have backed her\ninto one of the two corners and catch up to her \nat the last possible moment. You snatch the ceremonial sash \nfrom your opponent and wrap it around yourself. You are now the Spider Supreme, leader of all the world’s \neight-legged wonders. Just remember— with great spider power\ncomes great spider responsibility. "

        "text": "When Reverend Jim Jones founded\nthe Peoples Temple in 1955, few could have imagined \nits horrifying end. This progressive religious movement\nrose in popularity and gained support from some of San Francisco's \nmost prominent politicians. But in 1977, amidst revelations\nof brainwashing and abuse, Jones moved with several hundred followers to establish the commune of Jonestown \nin Guyana. Billed as a utopian paradise,\nthe colony was more like a prison camp, and when a congressional delegation\narrived to investigate its conditions, Jones executed his final plan. On November 18, 1978, 909 men,\nwomen, and children died after being forced to drink \npoisoned Flavor Aid. That grizzly image has since been\nimmortalized as shorthand slang for single-minded cult-like thinking, \"They drank the Kool-aid.\" Today, there are thousands of cults\naround the world. It's important to note two things\nabout them. First, not all cults are religious. Some are political, therapy-based, focused on self-improvement, or otherwise. And on the flip side, not all new religions are what \nwe're referring to as cults. So what exactly defines our modern\nunderstanding of cults, and why do people join them? Broadly speaking, a cult is a group\nor movement with a shared commitment to a usually\nextreme ideology that's typically embodied\nin a charismatic leader. And while few turn out as deadly\nas Jonestown or Heaven's Gate, which ended in a mass suicide \nof 39 people in 1997, most cults share some \nbasic characteristics. A typical cult requires a high level\nof commitment from its members and maintains a strict hierarchy, separating unsuspecting supporters\nand recruits from the inner workings. It claims to provide answers\nto life's biggest questions through its doctrine, along with the required recipe\nfor change that shapes a new member\ninto a true believer. And most importantly, it uses both\nformal and informal systems of influence and control\nto keep members obedient, with little tolerance for internal \ndisagreement or external scrutiny. You might wonder whether \nsome of these descriptions might also apply to established religions. In fact, the world \"cultus\" \noriginally described people who cultivated\nthe worship of certain gods by performing rituals \nand maintaining temples. But in time, it came to mean \nexcessive devotion. Many religions began as cults, but integrated into the fabric\nof the larger society as they grew. A modern cult, by contrast, separates\nits members from others. Rather than providing guidelines\nfor members to live better lives, a cult seeks to directly control them, from personal and family relationships, to financial assets \nand living arrangements. Cults also demand obedience \nto human leaders who tend to be highly persuasive people with authoritarian \nand narcissistic streaks motivated by money, sex, power,\nor all three. While a cult leader uses personal charisma\nto attract initial followers, further expansion works \nlike a pyramid scheme, with early members recruiting new ones. Cults are skilled at knowing \nwhom to target, often focusing on those new to an area, or who have recently undergone some\npersonal or professional loss. Loneliness and a desire for meaning make one susceptible to friendly people\noffering community. The recruitment process can be subtle, sometimes taking months\nto establish a relationship. In fact, more than two-thirds\nof cult members are recruited by a friend, family member, or co-worker whose invitations are harder to refuse. Once in the cult, members are subjected\nto multiple forms of indoctrination. Some play on our natural inclination to\nmimic social behaviors or follow orders. Other methods may be more intense using techniques of coercive persuasion\ninvolving guilt, shame, and fear. And in many cases, members may\nwillingly submit out of desire to belong and to attain the promised rewards. The cult environment discourages\ncritical thinking, making it hard to voice doubts when everyone around you is modeling\nabsolute faith. The resulting internal conflict,\nknown as cognitive dissonance, keeps you trapped, as each compromise makes it more \npainful to admit you've been deceived. And though most cults don't\nlead members to their death, they can still be harmful. By denying basic freedoms of thought,\nspeech, and association, cults stunt their members'\npsychological and emotional growth, a particular problem for children, who are deprived of normal\ndevelopmental activities and milestones. Nevertheless, many cult members\neventually find a way out, whether through their own realizations, the help of family and friends, or when the cult falls apart\ndue to external pressure or scandals. Many cults may be hard to identify, and for some, their beliefs,\nno matter how strange, are protected under religious freedom. But when their practices \ninvolve harassment, threats, illegal activities, or abuse, the law can intervene. Believing in something should not come\nat the cost of your family and friends, and if someone tells you to sacrifice\nyour relationships or morality for the greater good, they're most likely exploiting you\nfor their own.

But why doesn’t this caustic substance,\nejected at 100 degrees Celsius, hurt the beetle itself? In fact, how do any toxic animals \nsurvive their own secretions? The answer is that they use one \nof two basic strategies: securely storing these compounds or evolving resistance to them. Bombardier beetles use the first approach. They store ingredients for their poison \nin two separate chambers. When they’re threatened, the valve \nbetween the chambers opens and the substances combine \nin a violent chemical reaction that sends a corrosive spray \nshooting out of the glands, passing through a hardened chamber that\nprotects the beetle’s internal tissues. Similarly, jellyfish package \ntheir venom safely in harpoon-like structures \ncalled nematocysts. And venomous snakes store their\nflesh-eating, blood-clotting compounds in specialized compartments\nthat only have one exit: through the fangs \nand into their prey or predator. Snakes also employ the second strategy:\nbuilt-in biochemical resistance. Rattlesnakes and other types of vipers\nmanufacture special proteins that bind and inactivate venom \ncomponents in the blood. Meanwhile, poison dart frogs have also\nevolved resistance to their own toxins, but through a different mechanism. These tiny animals defend themselves \nusing hundreds of bitter-tasting compounds called alkaloids that they accumulate from consuming \nsmall arthropods like mites and ants. One of their most potent alkaloids \nis the chemical epibatidine, which binds to the same receptors \nin the brain as nicotine but is at least ten times stronger. An amount barely heavier than \na grain of sugar would kill you. So what prevents poison frogs \nfrom poisoning themselves? Think of the molecular target \nof a neurotoxic alkaloid as a lock, and the alkaloid itself as the key. When the toxic key slides into the lock, it sets off a cascade of chemical \nand electrical signals that can cause paralysis, unconsciousness, and eventually death. But if you change the shape of the lock,\nthe key can’t fit. For poison dart frogs and many other\nanimals with neurotoxic defenses, a few genetic changes alter\nthe structure of the alkaloid-binding site just enough to keep the neurotoxin \nfrom exerting its adverse effects. Poisonous and venomous animals aren’t the only ones that can develop \nthis resistance: their predators and prey can, too. The garter snake, which dines \non neurotoxic salamanders, has evolved resistance \nto salamander toxins through some of the same genetic changes \nas the salamanders themselves. That means that only the most toxic \nsalamanders can avoid being eaten— and only the most resistant snakes\nwill survive the meal. The result is that the genes providing \nthe highest resistance and toxicity will be passed on in greatest quantities \nto the next generations. As toxicity ramps up, resistance does too, in an evolutionary arms race \nthat plays out over millions of years. This pattern appears over and over again. Grasshopper mice resist painful \nvenom from scorpion prey through genetic changes \nin their nervous systems. Horned lizards readily \nconsume harvester ants, resisting their envenomed sting \nwith specialized blood plasma. And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts, prevent their activation \nwith compounds in their mucus, and repurpose them for their own defenses. The bombardier beetle is no exception: the toads that swallow them can tolerate the caustic spray \nthat Darwin found so distasteful. Most of the beetles \nare spit up hours later, amazingly alive and well. But how do the toads \nsurvive the experience? That is still a mystery. "

In spite of all this, its inhabitants\nbuilt the world’s first cities, with monumental architecture \nand large populations— and they built them \nentirely out of mud. Sumer occupied the southern part \nof modern Iraq in the region called Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia means “between two rivers”— the Tigris and the Euphrates. Around 5000 BCE, early Sumerians used\nirrigation channels, dams, and reservoirs to redirect river water and farm \nlarge areas of previously bone-dry land. Agricultural communities like this \nwere slowly springing up around the world. But Sumerians were the first\nto take the next step. Using clay bricks made from river mud, they began to build multi-storied\nhomes and temples. They invented the wheel— a potter’s wheel, for turning mud \ninto household goods and tools. Those clay bricks gave rise \nto the world’s first cities, probably around 4500 BCE. At the top of the city’s social ladder\nwere priests and priestesses, who were considered nobility, then merchants, craftspeople,\nfarmers, and enslaved people. The Sumerian empire \nconsisted of distinct city-states that operated like small nations. They were loosely linked \nby language and spiritual belief but lacked centralized control. The earliest cities were Uruk, \nUr, and Eridu, and eventually there were a dozen cities. Each had a king who served a role \nsomewhere between a priest and a ruler. Sometimes they fought against \neach other to conquer new territories. Each city was dedicated to a patron deity,\nconsidered the city’s founder. The largest and most important building \nin the city was this patron god’s home: the ziggurat, a temple designed\nas a stepped pyramid. Around 3200 BCE, Sumerians began \nto expand their reach. The potter’s wheel found a new home \non chariots and wagons. They built boats out of reeds \nand date palm leaves, with linen sails that carried \nthem vast distances by river and sea. To supplement scarce resources, \nthey built a trade network with the rising kingdoms in Egypt, \nAnatolia, and Ethiopia, importing gold, silver, \nlapis lazuli, and cedar wood. Trade was the unlikely impetus for the invention \nof the world’s first writing system. It started as a system of accounting\nfor Sumerian merchants conducting business with traders abroad. After a few hundred years, \nthe early pictogram system called cuneiform turned into a script. The Sumerians drafted up the first\nwritten laws and created the first school system, \ndesigned to teach the craft of writing— and pioneered some less exciting\ninnovations, like bureaucracy and taxes. In the schools, scribes studying \nfrom dawn to dusk, from childhood well into adulthood. They learned accounting, mathematics,\nand copied works of literature— hymns, myths, proverbs, animal fables, \nmagic spells, and the first epics on clay tablets. Some of those tablets told \nthe story of Gilgamesh, a king of the city of Uruk who was\nalso the subject of mythical tales. But by the third millennium BCE, Sumer\nwas no longer the only empire around, or even in Mesopotamia. Waves of nomadic tribes poured\ninto the region from the north and east. Some newcomers looked up to the Sumerians,\nadopting their way of life and using the cuneiform script \nto express their own languages. In 2300 BCE, the Akkadian king Sargon\nconquered the Sumerian city-states. But Sargon respected Sumerian culture, and Akkadians and Sumerians\nexisted side-by-side for centuries. Other invading groups focused \nonly on looting and destruction. Even as Sumerian culture spread, a steady onslaught of invasions killed\noff the Sumerian people by 1750 BCE. Afterward, Sumer disappeared \nback into the desert dirt, not to be rediscovered\nuntil the 19th century. But Sumerian culture lived \non for thousands of years— first through the Akkadians,\nthen the Assyrians, then the Babylonians. The Babylonians passed Sumerian \ninventions and traditions through along Hebrew, Greek, and Roman cultures. Some persist today. "

But he wasn’t arguing his innocence— in fact, his life depended on proving \nthat he had committed the fraud. Like many art forgers, \nHan van Meegeren was an artist whose original works had failed \nto bring him renown. Embittered towards the art world, van Meegeren set out to make fools \nof his detractors. He learned all he could \nabout the Old Masters— their biographies, their techniques, \nand their materials. The artist he chose for his deception \nwas 17th century Baroque painter Johannes Vermeer— an ambitious decision given Vermeer \nwas famed for his carefully executed and technically brilliant domestic scenes. Working in secret for six years, \nthe forger perfected his art, copying numerous works as practice. He mixed his own paints \nafter researching the raw materials and pigments available in Vermeer’s time. He bought 17th century canvases, \ncreated his own brushes, and aged the works \nby applying synthetic resin and baking them to dry \nand crack the paint. A forensic test could have detected \nthe synthetic resin. But at the time, such tests \nwere neither advanced nor widespread, and even today verification \nof a painting’s authenticity relies on the assessment \nof art specialists. So it’s a matter of their subjective \njudgment— as well as their reputation. And this is where van Meegeren \ntruly outwitted the art world. From his research, he knew historians \nbelieved Vermeer had an early period of religious painting influenced \nby the Italian painter Caravaggio. The leading authority on Vermeer, \nAbraham Bredius, was a huge proponent of this theory, \nthough none of these works had surfaced. So van Meegeren decided to make one. He called it \"The Supper at Emmaus.\" Bredius declared van Meegeren’s fake \nthe masterpiece of Vermeer’s oeuvre. Van Meegeren’s forgery was not totally \nup to Vermeer’s technical standards, but these inconsistencies \ncould be made to fit the narrative: this was an early work, produced before \nthe artist had come into his own. With the stamp of approval \nfrom the art world, the fake was sold in 1937 \nfor the equivalent of over $4 million in today’s money. The success prompted van Meegeren \nto forge and sell more works through various art dealers. As unbelievable as it may sound, the art world continued to believe \nin their authenticity. When the Nazis occupied Holland \nduring the Second World War, Hermann Göring, \none of Hitler’s top generals, sought to add a Vermeer \nto his collection of artwork looted from all over Europe. Van Meegeren obliged, selling him \nan alleged early Vermeer painting titled \"Christ with the Adulteress.\" As the tide of the war turned, \nso did van Meegeren’s luck. Following the Allied victory, he was \narrested for delivering a priceless piece of Dutch heritage to the Nazis— \nan act of treasonous collaboration punishable by death. To prove the painting \nwasn’t a national treasure, he explained step-by-step \nhow he had forged it. But he faced an unexpected obstacle— \nthe very expert who had enabled his scam. Moved to protect his reputation, Bredius \ndefended the painting’s authenticity. With few options left, van Meegeren \nset to work on a \"new\" Vermeer. When he presented the fake to the court, \nthey finally believed him. He was acquitted for collaborating \nwith the Nazis— and sentenced to a year imprisonment \nfor fraud. Though there’s evidence that van Meegeren \ndid, in fact, collaborate with the Nazis, he managed to convince the public \nthat he had tricked Göring on purpose, transforming his image into that \nof a folk hero who had swindled the Nazis. Thanks to this newfound notoriety, his works became valuable \nin their own right— so much so that they were later forged \nin turn by his own son. The same canvases went from \nrevered classics to despised forgeries to works of art respected for the skill \nand notoriety of the forger. "

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Jessica Ruby Olive oil is 100% fat; there's nothing else in it. Pancake mix, on the other hand, is only about 11% fat. And, yet, olive oil is good for you, and pancake mix is not. Why is that? As it turns out, the amount of fat we eat doesn't impact our weight or our cholesterol or our risk of heart disease nearly as much as what kind of fat we eat. But let's back up: What is fat? If we were to zoom in on a salmon, which is a fatty fish, past the organs, past the tissues, into the cells, we would see that the stuff we call fat is actually made up of molecules called triglycerides, and they are not all alike. Here's one example. Those three carbons on the left, that's glycerol. Now, you can think of that as the backbone that holds the rest of the molecule together. The three long chains on the right are called fatty acids, and it's subtle differences in the structures of these chains that determine whether a fat is, let's say, solid or liquid; whether or not it goes rancid quickly; and, most importantly, how good or how bad it is for you. Let's take a look at some of these differences. One is length. Fatty acids can be short or long. Another, more important difference is the type of bond between the carbon atoms. Some fatty acids have only single bonds. Others have both single and double bonds. Fatty acids with only single bonds are called saturated, and those with one or more double bonds are called unsaturated. Now, most unsaturated fats are good for you, while saturated fats are bad for you in excess. For saturated fats, the story pretty much ends there but not for unsaturated fats. The double bonds in these molecules have a kind of weird property; they're rigid. So, that means there are two ways to arrange every double bond. The first is like this, where both hydrogens are on same side and both carbons are on the same side. The second way is like this. Now the hydrogens and carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, even though both of these molecules are made up of exactly the same building blocks, they are two completely different substances, and they behave completely differently inside of us. The configuration on the left is called CIS, which you've probably never heard of. The one of the right is called TRANS, and you probably have heard of trans fats before. They don't go rancid, they're more stable during deep frying, and they can change the texture of foods in ways that other fats just can't. They're also terrible for your health, by far worse than saturated fat, even though technically they're a type of unsaturated fat. Now, I know that seems crazy, but your body doesn't care what a molecule looks like on paper. All that matters is the 3-D shape where the molecule fits, where it doesn't, and what pathways it interferes with. So, how do you know if a food has trans fat in it? Well, the only sure way to know is if you see the words, \"partially hydrogenated\" in the ingredients list. Don't let nutrition labels or advertising fool you. The FDA allows manufacturers to claim that their products contain \"0\" grams of trans fat even if they actually have up to half a gram per serving. But there are no hard and fast rules about how small a serving can be, and, that means, you'll have to rely on seeing those key words, partially hydrogenated, because that's how trans fats are made, by partially hydrogenating unsaturated fats. So, let's go back to our olive oil and pancake mix from before. Olive oil is 100% fat. Pancake mix is only 11% fat. But olive oil is mostly unsaturated fat, and it has no trans fat at all. On the other hand, more than half the fat in pancake mix is either saturated or trans fat. And, so, even though olive oil has 10 times as much fat as pancake mix, it's healthy for you, whereas pancake mix is not. Now, I'm not trying to pick on pancake mix. There are lots of foods with this type of fat profile. The point is this: It's not how much fat you eat, it's what kind of fat. And what makes a particular fat healthy or unhealthy is its shape. "

It's been featured in uncounted films\nand television commercials, but what is it \nand why does it sound that way? This is the opening of \"Spring\"\nfrom \"The Four Seasons,\" by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi. \"The Four Seasons\" are famous in part\nbecause they are a delight to the ear. However, even more notable is the fact that \nthey have stories to tell. At the time of their publication\nin Amsterdam in 1725, they were accompanied by poems describing exactly what feature\nof that season Vivaldi intended to capture \nin musical terms. In providing specific plot content\nfor instrumental music, Vivaldi was generations ahead of his time. If one were to read the poems\nsimultaneously to hearing the music, one would find the poetic scenes synchronizing nicely \nwith the musical imagery. We are told that the birds welcome\nspring with happy song, and here they are doing exactly that. Soon, however, \na thunderstorm breaks out. Not only is there musical thunder\nand lightning, there are also more birds, wet, frightened, and unhappy. In \"Summer,\" the turtle dove sings \nher name \"tortorella\" in Italian, before a hail storm flattens the fields. \"Autumn\" brings eager hunters dashing\nout in pursuit of their prey. The \"Winter\" concerto begins with teeth\nchattering in the cold before one takes refuge by\na crackling fire. Then it's back out into the storm where there'll be slips \nand falls on the ice. In these first weeks of winter,\nthe old year is coming to a close, and so does Vivaldi's musical exploration\nof the seasons. Not until the early 19th century would such expressive instrumental\nprogram music, as it was known, become popular. By then, larger, more varied ensembles\nwere the rule with woodwinds, brass, and percussion\nto help tell the tale. But Vivaldi pulled it off with just\none violin, strings, and a harpsichord. Unlike his contemporary Bach, Vivaldi wasn't much interested\nin complicated fugues. He preferred to offer readily\naccessible entertainment to his listeners with melodies that pop back up later\nin a piece to remind us of where we've been. So the first movement of the \"Spring\"\nconcerto begins with a theme for spring and ends with it, too, slightly varied\nfrom when it was last heard. It was an inspired way \nto attract listeners, and Vivaldi, considered one of the most electrifying \nviolinists of the early 18th century, understood the value \nof attracting audiences. Such concerts might feature himself\nas the star violinist. Others presented the young musicians\nof the Pietà, a Venetian girls' school\nwhere Vivaldi was Director of Music. Most of the students were orphans. Music training was intended not only\nas social skills suitable for young ladies but also as potential careers for those who might fail\nto make good marriages. Even in the composer's own time, Vivaldi's music served \nas diversion for all, not just for the wealthy aristocrats. 300 years later, it's an approach\nthat still works, and Vivaldi's music still sounds\nlike trotting horses on the move.

        "text": "In a 1973 study, 20 volunteers got drunk\nonce a week for 8 consecutive weeks, each time on a different \nalcoholic beverage, and each time with precisely \nthe same dosage— this was science,\nafter all. The goal of this experiment was to find\nout which alcoholic drinks cause worse hangovers. Of course, it takes much more than one \nsmall study to answer such a question. Since then, science has\nlearned a lot about hangovers— though some mysteries remain. The molecule responsible \nfor hangovers is ethanol, which we colloquially refer to as alcohol. Ethanol is present in all alcoholic\nbeverages, and generally speaking, the more ethanol, \nthe greater the potential for a hangover. The symptoms and severity can vary\ndepending on weight, age, genetics, and other factors. But still, hangovers generally share \nsome common— and unpleasant— features. So how exactly does alcohol\ncause a hangover? And is there any way \nto reliably prevent one? Alcohol slows down the communication\nbetween neural cells. After someone has had their last drink, as the concentration of alcohol \nin the blood drops back to zero, the brain rebounds from sedation \nand swings in the other direction, entering a hyperactive state. This may lead to the tremors or \nrapid heartbeat associated with hangovers. It also makes sleep shorter \nand less restful than normal. But these effects are just the beginning— alcohol impacts so many \nof the body’s processes, throwing delicate balances off-kilter. And even the most familiar hangover\nsymptoms have surprising contributors. For example, alcohol disrupts\nlevels of many hormones. One of those hormones is cortisol. Normally, fluctuating cortisol levels\nhelp regulate wakefulness throughout the day and night. So the disruption in cortisol \nduring a hangover may cause people to feel groggy \nor disoriented. Another hormone alcohol interferes\nwith is vasopressin, which normally decreases the volume \nof urine made by the kidneys. By decreasing levels of vasopressin, alcohol causes people to pee more\nand become dehydrated. Dehydration can lead to thirst, dry mouth,\nweakness, lightheadedness, and headache, one of the most common hangover symptoms. In addition to dehydration, \nhangover headaches can result from alcohol’s influence \non chemical signaling in the brain, especially on neurotransmitters\ninvolved in pain signaling. Alcohol can also damage mitochondria, which are responsible for producing\nthe ATP that gives us energy. This may contribute to the fatigue,\nweakness, and mood disturbances experienced during a hangover. Meanwhile, alcohol stimulates\nthe immune system, leading to inflammation that can\ndamage cells within the brain, affect mood, and impair memory. And it can irritate \nthe gastrointestinal tract and inflame the lining \nof the stomach and intestines. Alcohol may also slow down\nstomach emptying, which could lead to increased\nproduction of gastric acid. This is why alcohol can cause \nstomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Alcoholic drinks also contain other\nsubstances that are produced during the fermentation process \nthat give the drink its specific flavor. Some evidence suggests that one of these,\nmethanol, is particularly bad for hangovers. The body doesn’t start\nmetabolizing methanol until it’s done processing ethanol. And when it does, \nthe toxic metabolites of methanol may potentially worsen \nthe hangover symptoms. Beverages that are closer to pure ethanol,\nsuch as gin and vodka, may cause fewer hangover effects. Meanwhile, the presence of flavoring\ningredients in beverages like whiskey, brandy, and red wine, may make these kinds of alcohol \ncause more hangover symptoms. So, the choice of alcoholic\nbeverage matters, but any of them can cause hangovers,\nsimply because they all contain alcohol. So, do common hangover remedies\nactually work? Drinking water and electrolyte beverages\ncan help reduce symptoms related to dehydration. And eating— especially carbs—\ncan help replenish the glucose levels alcohol reduces. But ultimately, the only sure way \nto prevent a hangover is to drink alcohol in moderation\nor not at all. "

        "text": "It was the largest contiguous land \nempire in history— stretching from Korea to Ukraine and \nfrom Siberia to southern China, and was forged on the open plains. In the 12th century CE, before the \nMongol Empire formed, the East Asian steppe was home to \nscattered groups of Mongol and Turkic pastoral nomads led by Khans. The people herded sheep, cattle, \nyaks and camels. They lived in felt tents and moved between\nsummer and winter campsites. Nomadic women held significant authority,  managing these migrations, \nmany of the flocks and trade. Meanwhile, men specialized in \nmounted warfare. These nomadic groups often \nfought each other. That was to change under Temujin, who was\nborn into an aristocratic Mongol family. Despite losing his father at an early age \nand growing up in poverty, he quickly rose to power by forging \nstrategic alliances with other leaders. Unlike those khans, Temujin promoted \nsoldiers based on merit and distributed spoils evenly \namong them. His most brilliant move was to scatter \nthe nomads he conquered among his own soldiers so they couldn't \njoin together against him. These innovations made him unstoppable, and by 1206, he had united the people \nof the felt-walled tents and become Chinggis Khan. The Mongols were shamanists, believing that the spirits of nature \nand their ancestors inhabited the world around them. Over all arched the Sky god Tenggeri. Chinggis Khan believed that Tenggeri \nwanted him to conquer the entire world in his name. With the nomads of the Mongolian \nplain united, this seemed within reach. Anyone who resisted the Mongols was \nresisting Tenggeri's will, and for this insubordination, had to die. Under Chinggis Khan, the Mongols first subdued northern China \nand the eastern Islamic lands. After his death in 1227, the Divine Mandate passed to his family, \nor the Golden Lineage. In the 1230s, Chinggis Khan's sons \nand daughters conquered the Turks of Central Asia \nand the Russian princes, then destroyed two European \narmies in 1241. In the 1250s, the Mongols seized Islamic \nterritory as far as Baghdad, while in the East their grasp reached\nsouthern China by 1279. Life within the Mongol Empire wasn't just \nwar, pillage and destruction. Once the Mongols conquered a territory,\nthey left its internal politics alone and used local administrators to \ngovern for them. The Mongols let all religions flourish, \nas long as the leaders prayed for them. Although they routinely captured artisans,\nscholars and engineers, they appreciated what those \nspecialists could do and forcibly settled them across Asia \nto continue their work. The most valuable produce in \nthe Empire was gold brocade, which took silk from China, gold from \nTibet and weavers from Baghdad. Gold brocade clothed the Mongol rulers, \ncovered their horses and lined their tents. The Mongols particularly prized gunpowder \ntechnicians from China. With much of Eurasia politically unified, \ntrade flourished along the Silk Road, helped by an extensive system of horse \nmessengers and relay posts. Robust trade continued at sea, especially \nin blue-and-white porcelain, which combined white pottery from Mongol \nChina with blue dye from Mongol Iran. But this was not to last. Succession to the Great Khan didn't \nautomatically go to the eldest son, but rather allowed brothers, uncles and \ncousins to vie for leadership with senior widows acting as \nregents for their sons. By the 1260s, Chinggis Khan's grandsons were in a full-\nblown civil war over inheritance and fragmented the realm into \nfour separate empires. In China, Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty is remembered as a golden age of \nscience and culture. In Iran, the Ilkhanate inaugurated \nthe development of new monumental architecture and \nPersian miniature painting. In Central Asia, the Chagatai Khanate \nbrought forth leaders like Timur and his descendant Babur, who founded \nthe Mughal Empire in India. And in Eastern Europe, \nthe Golden Horde ruled for years until a trading post named Muscovy grew \ninto a major world power. Even though the Empire lasted \nonly a short while, the Mongols left a legacy of world-\ndomination that remains unmatched today. "

        "text": "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\nis one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to \nexpand into general pop culture. It says that you can never simultaneously\nknow the exact position and the exact speed of an object\nand shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism\nto sports commentary. Uncertainty is often explained as a result\nof measurement, that the act of measuring an object's\nposition changes its speed, or vice versa. The real origin is much deeper\nand more amazing. The Uncertainty Principle exists\nbecause everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave\nat the same time. In quantum mechanics, the exact position\nand exact speed of an object have no meaning. To understand this, we need to think about what it means\nto behave like a particle or a wave. Particles, by definition, exist in \na single place at any instant in time. We can represent this by a graph\nshowing the probability of finding the object at a particular place,\nwhich looks like a spike, 100% at one specific position,\nand zero everywhere else. Waves, on the other hand,\nare disturbances spread out in space, like ripples covering \nthe surface of a pond. We can clearly identify features\nof the wave pattern as a whole, most importantly, its wavelength, which is the distance between two \nneighboring peaks, or two neighboring valleys. But we can't assign it a single position. It has a good probability of \nbeing in lots of different places. Wavelength is essential for\nquantum physics because an object's wavelength\nis related to its momentum, mass times velocity. A fast-moving object has lots of momentum, which corresponds to \na very short wavelength. A heavy object has lots of momentum\neven if it's not moving very fast, which again means a very short wavelength. This is why we don't notice\nthe wave nature of everyday objects. If you toss a baseball up in the air, its wavelength is a billionth of a \ntrillionth of a trillionth of a meter, far too tiny to ever detect. Small things, \nlike atoms or electrons though, can have wavelengths big enough\nto measure in physics experiments. So, if we have a pure wave, \nwe can measure its wavelength, and thus its momentum,\nbut it has no position. We can know a particles position\nvery well, but it doesn't have a wavelength,\nso we don't know its momentum. To get a particle with both position\nand momentum, we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has waves,\nbut only in a small area. How can we do this? By combining waves \nwith different wavelengths, which means giving our quantum object some\npossibility of having different momenta. When we add two waves, \nwe find that there are places where the peaks line up,\nmaking a bigger wave, and other places where the peaks of one\nfill in the valleys of the other. The result has regions where\nwe see waves separated by regions of nothing at all. If we add a third wave, the regions where the waves cancel out\nget bigger, a fourth and they get bigger still,\nwith the wavier regions becoming narrower. If we keep adding waves,\nwe can make a wave packet with a clear wavelength\nin one small region. That's a quantum object with both\nwave and particle nature, but to accomplish this,\nwe had to lose certainty about both position and momentum. The positions isn't restricted \nto a single point. There's a good probability\nof finding it within some range of the center of the wave packet, and we made the wave packet\nby adding lots of waves, which means there's \nsome probability of finding it with the momentum corresponding\nto any one of those. Both position and momentum\nare now uncertain, and the uncertainties are connected. If you want to reduce \nthe position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet,\nyou need to add more waves, which means a bigger momentum uncertainty. If you want to know the momentum better,\nyou need a bigger wave packet, which means a bigger position uncertainty. That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, first stated by German physicist\nWerner Heisenberg back in 1927. This uncertainty isn't a matter\nof measuring well or badly, but an inevitable result\nof combining particle and wave nature. The Uncertainty Principle isn't just \na practical limit on measurment. It's a limit on what properties \nan object can have, built into the fundamental structure\nof the universe itself. "

Shipping containers washed overboard, and the waves swept 28,000 rubber ducks \nand other toys into the North Pacific. But they didn’t stick together. Quite the opposite– the ducks have since washed up \nall over the world, and researchers have used their paths to chart a better understanding\nof ocean currents. Ocean currents are driven \nby a range of sources: the wind, tides, changes in water density, and the rotation of the Earth. The topography of the ocean floor \nand the shoreline modifies those motions, causing currents to speed up, slow down, or change direction. Ocean currents fall into \ntwo main categories: surface currents and deep ocean currents. Surface currents control the motion of the top 10 percent \nof the ocean’s water, while deep-ocean currents mobilize \nthe other 90 percent. Though they have different causes, surface and deep ocean currents \ninfluence each other in an intricate dance that keeps \nthe entire ocean moving. Near the shore, surface currents are driven \nby both the wind and tides, which draw water back and forth \nas the water level falls and rises. Meanwhile, in the open ocean, wind is the \nmajor force behind surface currents. As wind blows over the ocean, it drags the top layers \nof water along with it. That moving water pulls on \nthe layers underneath, and those pull on the ones beneath them. In fact, water as deep as 400 meters is still affected by the wind \nat the ocean’s surface. If you zoom out to look at the patterns \nof surface currents all over the earth, you’ll see that they form \nbig loops called gyres, which travel clockwise \nin the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise \nin the southern hemisphere. That’s because of the way \nthe Earth’s rotation affects the wind patterns that\ngive rise to these currents. If the earth didn’t rotate, air and water would simply \nmove back and forth between low pressure at the equator and high pressure at the poles. But as the earth spins, air moving from the equator to the \nNorth Pole is deflected eastward, and air moving back down \nis deflected westward. The mirror image happens \nin the southern hemisphere, so that the major streams of wind form loop-like patterns \naround the ocean basins. This is called the Coriolis Effect. The winds push the ocean beneath \nthem into the same rotating gyres. And because water holds onto heat \nmore effectively than air, these currents help redistribute \nwarmth around the globe. Unlike surface currents, deep ocean currents are driven primarily \nby changes in the density of seawater. As water moves towards the North Pole, it gets colder. It also has a higher \nconcentration of salt, because the ice crystals that form \ntrap water while leaving salt behind. This cold, salty water is more dense, so it sinks, and warmer surface water takes its place, setting up a vertical current called \nthermohaline circulation. Thermohaline circulation of deep water \nand wind-driven surface currents combine to form a winding loop \ncalled the Global Conveyor Belt. As water moves from the depths of \nthe ocean to the surface, it carries nutrients that nourish the \nmicroorganisms which form the base of many \nocean food chains. The global conveyor belt is the\nlongest current in the world, snaking all around the globe. But it only moves a few \ncentimeters per second. It could take a drop of water \na thousand years to make the full trip. However, rising sea temperatures are \ncausing the conveyor belt to seemingly slow down. Models show this causing havoc with \nweather systems on both sides of the Atlantic, and no one knows what would happen if it \ncontinues to slow or if it stopped altogether. The only way we’ll be able to forecast\ncorrectly and prepare accordingly will be to continue to study currents \nand the powerful forces that shape them. "

        "text": "If you want a glimpse \nof Marie Curie's manuscripts, you'll have to sign a waiver and put on\nprotective gear to shield yourself \nfrom radiation contamination. Madame Curie's remains, too,\nwere interred in a lead-lined coffin, keeping the radiation that was the heart\nof her research, and likely the cause of her death,\nwell contained. Growing up in Warsaw \nin Russian-occupied Poland, the young Marie, originally named\nMaria Sklodowska, was a brilliant student,\nbut she faced some challenging barriers. As a woman, she was barred from pursuing\nhigher education, so in an act of defiance, Marie enrolled in the Floating University, a secret institution that provided\nclandestine education to Polish youth. By saving money and working\nas a governess and tutor, she eventually was able to move to Paris\nto study at the reputed Sorbonne. There, Marie earned both a physics\nand mathematics degree surviving largely on bread and tea, and sometimes fainting \nfrom near starvation. In Paris, Marie met the physicist \nPierre Curie, who shared his lab and his heart with her. But she longed to be back in Poland. Upon her return to Warsaw, though, she found that securing \nan academic position as a woman remained a challenge. All was not lost. Back in Paris, \nthe lovelorn Pierre was waiting, and the pair quickly married and became\na formidable scientific team. Another physicist's work sparked\nMarie Curie's interest. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered\nthat uranium spontaneously emitted a mysterious X-ray-like radiation that\ncould interact with photographic film. Curie soon found that the element\nthorium emitted similar radiation. Most importantly, \nthe strength of the radiation depended solely on the element's quantity, and was not affected by physical\nor chemical changes. This led her to conclude that radiation\nwas coming from something fundamental within the atoms of each element. The idea was radical and helped to disprove the long-standing\nmodel of atoms as indivisible objects. Next, by focusing on a super radioactive \nore called pitchblende, the Curies realized that uranium alone\ncouldn't be creating all the radiation. So, were there other radioactive elements\nthat might be responsible? In 1898, they reported two new elements, polonium, named for Marie's native Poland, and radium, the Latin word for ray. They also coined the term radioactivity\nalong the way. By 1902, the Curies had extracted a tenth\nof a gram of pure radium chloride salt from several tons of pitchblende, an incredible feat at the time. Later that year, Pierre Curie \nand Henri Becquerel were nominated for \nthe Nobel Prize in physics, but Marie was overlooked. Pierre took a stand in support\nof his wife's well-earned recognition. And so both of the Curies and Becquerel\nshared the 1903 Nobel Prize, making Marie Curie the first female\nNobel Laureate. Well funded and well respected,\nthe Curies were on a roll. But tragedy struck in 1906 when Pierre\nwas crushed by a horse-drawn cart as he crossed a busy intersection. Marie, devastated, immersed herself\nin her research and took over Pierre's teaching position\nat the Sorbonne, becoming the school's \nfirst female professor. Her solo work was fruitful. In 1911, she won yet another Nobel, this time in chemistry for her earlier\ndiscovery of radium and polonium, and her extraction and analysis of\npure radium and its compounds. This made her the first, \nand to this date, only person to win Nobel Prizes\nin two different sciences. Professor Curie put \nher discoveries to work, changing the landscape of medical research\nand treatments. She opened mobile radiology units\nduring World War I, and investigated radiation's\neffects on tumors. However, these benefits to humanity\nmay have come at a high personal cost. Curie died in 1934 of \na bone marrow disease, which many today think was caused\nby her radiation exposure. Marie Curie's revolutionary research laid the groundwork for our understanding\nof physics and chemistry, blazing trails in oncology, technology, \nmedicine, and nuclear physics, to name a few. For good or ill, her discoveries \nin radiation launched a new era, unearthing some of \nscience's greatest secrets. "

        "text": "From Ancient Greece to the 20th century, Aristotle, Sigmund Freud,\nand numerous other scholars were all looking for the same thing: eel testicles. Freshwater eels, or Anguilla Anguilla,\ncould be found in rivers across Europe, but no one had ever seen them mate. And despite countless dissections, no researcher could find eel eggs\nor identify their reproductive organs. Devoid of data, naturalists proposed \nvarious eel origin stories. Aristotle suggested that eels \nspontaneously emerged from mud. Pliny the Elder argued eels \nrubbed themselves against rocks, and the subsequent scrapings \ncame to life. Eels were said to hatch on rooftops,\nmanifest from the gills of other fish, and even emerge \nfrom the bodies of beetles. But the true story of eel reproduction\nis even more difficult to imagine. And to solve this slippery mystery, scholars would have to rethink \ncenturies of research. Today, we know the freshwater eel \nlifecycle has five distinct stages: larval leptocepheli, miniscule glass eels,\nadolescent elvers, older yellow eels, and adult silver eels. Given the radical physical differences \nbetween these phases, you’d be forgiven for assuming \nthese are different animals. In fact, that’s exactly what \nEuropean naturalists thought. Researchers were aware of leptocepheli\nand glass eels, but no one guessed they were related\nto the elvers and yellow eels living hundreds of kilometers upstream. Confusing matters more, eels don’t \ndevelop sex organs until late in life. And the entirety of their time \nin the rivers of Europe is essentially eel adolescence. So when do eels reproduce, \nand where do they do it? Despite its name, the life \nof a freshwater eel actually begins in the salty waters \nof the Bermuda Triangle. At the height of the annual \ncyclone season, thousands of three-millimeter eel larvae drift out of the Sargasso Sea. From here, they follow migration \npaths to North America and Europe— continents that were \nmuch closer when eels established these routes \n40 million years ago. Over the next 300 days, Anguilla Anguilla\nlarvae ride the ocean currents 6,500 km to the coast of Europe— making one of the longest \nknown marine migrations. By the time they arrive, they’ve grown \napproximately 45 mm, and transformed into semi-transparent \nglass eels. It’s not just their appearance \nthat’s changed. If most marine fish entered \nbrackish coastal waters, their cells would swell with freshwater\nin a lethal explosion. But when glass eels reach the coast, their kidneys shift to retain more salt and maintain their blood’s \nsalinity levels. Swarms of these newly freshwater \nfish migrate up streams and rivers, sometimes piling on top of each other\nto clear obstacles and predators. Those that make it upstream develop\ninto opaque elvers. Having finally arrived \nin their hunting grounds, elvers begin to eat everything \nthey can fit into their mouths. These omnivores grow in proportion\nto their diets, and over the next decade they develop\ninto larger yellow eels. In this stage, they grow \nto be roughly 80 cm, and finally develop sexual organs. But the last phase of eel life— \nand the secret of their reproduction— remains mysterious. In 1896, researchers identified \nleptocepheli as larval eels, and deduced that they had come \nto Europe from somewhere in the Atlantic. However, to find this mysterious \nbreeding ground, someone would have to perform \nan unthinkable survey of the ocean for larvae no larger than 30mm. Enter Johannes Schmidt. For the next 18 years, \nthis Danish oceanographer trawled the coasts of four continents, hunting down increasingly \ntiny leptocepheli. Finally, in 1921, he found \nthe smallest larvae yet, on the southern edge \nof the Sargasso Sea. Despite knowledge \nof their round trip migration, scientists still haven’t observed \nmating in the wild, or found a single eel egg. Leading theories suggest \nthat eels reproduce in a flurry of external fertilization, in which clouds of sperm \nfertilize free-floating eggs. But the powerful currents \nand tangling seaweed of the Sargasso Sea have made this theory \ndifficult to confirm. Researchers don’t even know where to look, since they’ve yet to successfully\ntrack an eel over the course of its return migration. Until these challenges can be met, the eel’s ancient secret will continue\nto slip through our fingers. "

Scientists have long pondered, \"Why do some people lose their hair,\nand how can we bring it back?\" The full-headed among us have about\n100,000 to 150,000 hairs on our scalps, and scientists have discovered two things\nabout this dense thicket. Firstly, the sprouting hair we see\nis mostly made up of keratin, the protein leftover from dead cells\nthat are forced upwards as new cells grow beneath them. Secondly, the structures \nthat drive hair growth are called hair follicles, a network of complex organs\nthat forms before we're born, and grows hair in an everlasting cycle. This cycle has three main phases. The first is anagen, the growth phase, which up to 90% of your hair follicles\nare experiencing right now, causing them to push up hair\nat a rate of one centimeter per month. Anagen can last for two to seven years,\ndepending on your genes. After this productive period, signals within the skin instruct\nsome follicles to enter a new phase known as catagen, or the regressing stage, causing hair follicles to shrink\nto a fraction of their original length. Catagen lasts for\nabout two to three weeks and cuts blood supply to the follicle,\ncreating a club hair, meaning it's ready to be shed. Finally, hairs enter telogen,\nthe resting phase, which lasts for ten to twelve weeks, and affects about \n5-15% of your scalp follicles. During telogen, up to 200 club hairs\ncan be shed in a day, which is quite normal. Then, the growth cycle begins anew. But not all heads are hairy, and, in fact, some of them grow\nincreasingly patchy over time in response to bodily changes. 95% of baldness in men can\nbe attributed to male pattern baldness. Baldness is inherited, and in people with this condition, follicles become incredibly sensitive\nto the effects of dihydrotestosterone, a hormonal product \nmade from testosterone. DHT causes shrinkage \nin these overly sensitive follicles, making hair shorter and wispier. But loss isn't sudden. It happens gradually, along a metric\nknown as the Norwood Scale, which describes the severity of hair loss. First, hair recedes along the temples, then hair on the crown begins to thin\nin a circular pattern. At the highest rating on the scale, these balding areas meet \nand expand dramatically, eventually leaving only a ring\nof sparse hair around the temples and the back of the head. Genetics isn't all that drives hair loss. Long periods of stress can release\nsignals that shock follicles and force them into \nthe resting phase prematurely. Some women experience this\nafter childbirth. Follicles might also lose the ability\nto go into anagen, the growth phase. People going through chemotherapy\ntreatment temporarily experience this. But while balding may look permanent, scientific investigation \nhas revealed the opposite. Below the skin's surface, the roots that give rise to our hair\nactually remain alive. Using this knowledge, scientists have developed drugs\nthat shorten the resting phase, and force follicles into anagen. Other drugs combat male pattern baldness by blocking the conversion \nof testosterone to DHT so that it doesn't affect \nthose sensitive follicles. Stem cells also play a role in regulating\nthe growth cycle, and so scientists are investigating\nwhether they can manipulate the activity of these cells to encourage\nfollicles to start producing hair again. And in the meantime, while scientists hone \ntheir hair-reviving methods, anyone going bald, \nor considering baldness, can remember that \nthey're in great company. "

        "text": "In the ocean’s depths,\ntwo titans wage battle: the sperm whale and the colossal squid. Sperm whales use echolocation \nto hunt these squid for food, but even against this gigantic animal,\nsquid can put up an impressive fight. Scientists know this because on the bodies\nof washed-up whales, they frequently find huge, \nround suction scars, emblazoned there by large, \ngrasping tentacles. Ranging in size from \nthis giant’s impressive 14 meters to the 2.5 centimeters \nof the southern pygmy squid, these creatures fall into the group \nof animals known as cephalopods. There are about 500 squid \nspecies worldwide, and they live in all the world’s oceans, making them a reliable food source\nfor whales, dolphins, sharks, seabirds, fish, and even other squid. Indeed, squid themselves \nare fearsome ocean predators. But their most extraordinary adaptations are those that have evolved \nto help them thwart their predators. Squid, which can be found mainly in estuarine, deep-sea, \nand open-water habitats, often swim together in shoals. Being out in the open without anywhere \nto hide makes them vulnerable, so as a first line of defense,\nthey rely on large, well-developed eyes. In the colossal squid, \nthese are the size of dinner plates, the largest known eyes \nin the animal kingdom. When it’s dark or the water is murky, \nhowever, squid rely on a secondary sensory system, made from thousands of tiny hair cells \nthat are only about twelve microns long and run along their heads and arms. Each of these hair cells is attached\nto axons in the nervous system. Swimming animals create a wake, so when the hairs on \nthe squid’s body detect this motion, they send a signal to the brain, which helps it determine \nthe direction of the water’s flow. This way, a squid can sense an oncoming \npredator in even the dimmest waters. Aware of the threat, a squid \ncan then mask itself from a predator. Squid skin contains thousands\nof tiny organs called chromatophores, each made of black, brown, red \nor yellow pigments and ringed in muscle. Reflecting cells beneath \nthe chromatophores mirror the squid’s surroundings,\nenabling it to blend in. So, when the muscles contract, the color of the pigment is exposed, whereas when the muscles relax \nthe colors are hidden. Each of these chromatophores is under the individual control \nof the squid’s nervous system, so while some expand, \nothers remain contracted. That enables countershading, where the underside of the squid\nis lighter than the top, to eliminate a silhouette \nthat a predator might spy from below. Some predators, however, \nlike the whales and dolphins, get around this ruse by using sound waves\nto detect a squid’s camouflaged form. Not to be outfoxed, the squid still \nhas two more tricks up its sleeve. The first involves ink, \nproduced inside its mantle. Squid ink is made mostly of mucus\nand melanin, which produces its dark coloring. When squid eject the ink, they either use it to make \na large smokescreen that completely blocks the predator’s view or a blob that roughly mimics the size \nand shape of the squid. This creates a phantom form, \ncalled a pseudomorph, that tricks the predator \ninto thinking it’s the real squid. As a final touch, \nsquid rely on jet propulsion to rapidly shoot away from their hunters, reaching speeds of up to 25 miles per hour\nand moving meters away in mere seconds. This makes them \nEarth’s fastest invertebrates. Some squid species have also developed \nunique adaptive behaviors. The deep-sea vampire squid,\nwhen startled, uses its webbed arms to make \na cape it hides behind. The tiny bobtail, on the other hand, \ntosses sand over its body as it burrows away from prying eyes. The Pacific flying squid \nuses jet propulsion for another purpose: to launch itself right out of the water. Squids’ inventive adaptations \nhave allowed them to proliferate \nfor over 500 million years. Even now, \nwe’re still uncovering new species. And as we do, we’re bound to discover even more\nabout how these stealthy cephalopods have mastered survival \nin the deep and unforgiving sea. "

        "text": "You’re the realm’s greatest mathematician, but ever since you criticized\nthe emperor's tax laws, you’ve been locked in the dungeon \nwith only a marker to count the days. But one day you're suddenly brought\nbefore the emperor, who looks even angrier than usual. One of his 12 governors has been convicted\nof paying his taxes with a counterfeit coin, which has already made its way \ninto the Treasury. As the kingdom's greatest mathematician, you’ve been granted a chance to earn \nyour freedom by identifying the fake. Before you are the 12 identical looking\ncoins and a balance scale. You know that the false coin will be very\nslightly lighter or heavier than the rest. But the emperor’s not a patient man. You may only use the scale three times before you’ll be thrown \nback into the dungeon. You look around for\nanything else you can use, but there's nothing in the room,\njust the coins, the scale, and your trusty marker. How do you identify the counterfeit? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Obviously, you can't weigh each coin\nagainst all of the others, so you’ll have to weigh several coins\nat the same time by splitting the stack \ninto multiple piles, then narrowing down where\nthe false coin is. Start by dividing the 12 coins \ninto three equal piles of four. Placing two of these on the scale\ngives us two possible outcomes. If the two sides balance, \nall eight coins on the scale are real and the fake must be among \nthe remaining four. So how do you keep track of these results?\nThat’s where the marker comes in. Mark the eight authentic\ncoins with a zero. Now take three of them and weigh them\nagainst three unmarked coins. If they balance, the remaining unmarked\ncoin must be the fake. If they don’t, draw a plus \non the three unmarked coins if they’re heavier, \nor a minus if they’re lighter. Now take two of the newly marked coins\nand weigh them against each other. If they balance, the third coin is fake. Otherwise, look at their marks. If they are plus coins, \nthe heavier one is the impostor. If they are marked with minus,\nit's the lighter one. But what if the first two piles\nyou way don't balance? Mark the coins on the heavier side\nwith a plus and those on the lighter side \nwith a minus. You can also mark the remaining four\ncoins with zeros, since you know the fake one \nis already somewhere on the scale. Now you'll need to think strategically so you can remove all remaining ambiguity\nin just two more ways. To do this, you’ll need \nto reassemble the piles. One method is to replace three \nof the plus coins with three of the minus coins and replace those\nwith three of the zero coins. From here, you have three possibilities. If the previously heavier side \nof the scale is still heavier, that means either the remaining \nplus coin on that side is actually the heavier one, or the remaining minus coin on the \nlighter side is actually the lighter one. Choose either one of them and weigh it \nagainst one of the regular coins to see which is true. If the previously heavier side \nbecame lighter, that means one of the three minus coins\nyou moved is actually the lighter one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third is counterfeit. If not, the lighter one is. Similarly, if the two sides balanced\nafter your substitution, then one of the three plus coins \nyou removed must be the heavier one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third one is fake. If not, then it's the heavier one. The emperor nods approvingly\nat your finding, and the counterfeiting lord \ntakes your place in the dungeon. "

One-by-one, they will fall prey to the remarkable, \npredatory antics of... a carnivorous plant. Around the world there are more than \n600 plant species that supplement a regular \ndiet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, \nor even frogs and rats. Scientists believe that carnivory in \nplants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh-munching \nadaptation holds a major benefit for plants. Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places \nwith highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients \nlike nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, \nand digest prey have an advantage over those that rely \non soil for their nutrients. Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme. Drawn to the pitcher’s vivid colors \nand alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar. But this pitcher species has an ingredient\ncalled coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects. As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, \nand falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns. Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly\nbreak his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher \nplant can consume through its leaves. Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the \nfatal funnel of the pitcher plant. The second victim faces off with the \nsticky sundew plant. The sundew’s tiny leaves are equipped with\na viscous secretion called mucilage. The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo. As she struggles, enzymes begin \nto digest her body. Special tentacles sense her movement \nand curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip. Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again \nto snare their next victim. Two down, four to go. The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant. He enters the roots through a tiny slit\nin search of food. But inside, he quickly loses his way \nthrough the tangled labyrinth. A forest of curved hairs \nprevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber\nwith flesh-digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen. In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path\nof the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants. She treads on the bladderwort’s trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in. Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside \nthe plant gets digested. Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper \ninto the plant to be digested alive bit by bit. Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by \nsweet-smelling nectar. The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the \nworld’s most infamous carnivorous plant. His landing triggers tiny hairs on the \nsurface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap \nsnap shut around him. The spikes interlock to seal his fate. Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach\nthat digests the beetle’s soft tissues. When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his \nexoskeleton remains. The mayfly is the last creature standing. As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high\nabove the plant’s globs of adhesive goo. She alights on the petals, drinks the \nnectar, and takes off unscathed. These long flower stalks keep certain \ninsects away from the carnivore’s traps— a way of separating pollinators from food. Off the mayfly buzzes \nto live a long and fruitful life– oh. "

        "text": "More than 3,000 years ago, \na flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, \nthe ancient Minoans likely found ways to use \nthe same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations \nwere on to something— opium, \nan extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure \nand reduce pain. Though opium has remained \nin use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century \nthat one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified \nand isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances \nmade directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies \ncreated a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, \noxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds \nare collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, \nopioid drugs are very effective painkillers,\nbut they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began \nto market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying \ntheir addictive potential to both the medical community \nand the public. The number of opioid painkillers \nprescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, \nbeginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids \nare so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect \nthe human body from the first dose, through repeated use, \nto what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs \nhas slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by\nbinding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals \nby binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind \nmuch more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more \nsevere pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything\nfrom mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, \nopioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects \nare more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s \nnatural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, \nit triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure \nand may be responsible for the sense of euphoria \nthat characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress \nthe release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, \ndigestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline\nenough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart\nand breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness \nand even death. Over time, the body starts \nto develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number \nof opioid receptors, or the receptors may become \nless responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine\nand resulting mood effects as before, people have to take \nlarger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence \nand addiction. As people take more opioids \nto compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels \nbecome lower and lower, to a point that could impact \nbasic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing \nits number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts \nof noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity \nto noradrenaline allows the body \nto continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids \nto maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent \non opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase \nwithin a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer \nto get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors \nit made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive \nto noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes \nwithdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, \nfever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal \ncan be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal \ncan be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids \naren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, \nbut rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs \nwhile in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care \nof them during withdrawal. If someone goes back \nto using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk \nfor overdose, because what would have been a standard \ndose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths \nfrom opioid overdose have grown exponentially \nin the United States, and opioid addictions have \nalso exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions \nare becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction \nare still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction \nwere middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers \nthey had been prescribed, or received from friends \nand family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced \nto prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit \nsynthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation \nof opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing \nrates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently \nour best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors \nbut doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids \nfrom binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors \nto reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction \nis rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence \nare also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient \nand outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, \nand psychotherapy. But many of these programs \nare very expensive, and the more affordable options \ncan have long waiting lists. They also often require complete \ndetoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common \nmonths-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk \nlosing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim \nto address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse \nusing a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms \nwith drugs that bind to opioid receptors \nbut don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, \nand other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance \ndrugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver \nto prescribe them— even though no specific training \nor certification is required to prescribe \nopioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even \na growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go \nwith combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources \nfor making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling \nwith opioid use in the United States, the Department of Health \nand Human Services operates a helpline: 800-662-4357 and a database of more than 14,000 \nsubstance abuse facilities in the US: www.hhs.gov/opioids "

Over the next few months, she would craft\nthe story of Frankenstein. Popular depictions may evoke a green\nand groaning figure, but that's not Mary Shelley's monster. In fact, in the book, Frankenstein\nrefers to the nameless monster's maker, Dr. Victor Frankenstein. So tense is the struggle between\ncreator and creature that the two have merged \nin our collective imagination. Before you read \nor reread the original text, there are several other things that \nare helpful to know about Frankenstein and how it came to assume \nits multiple meanings. The book traces Dr. Frankenstein's\nfutile quest to impart and sustain life. He constructs his monster\npart by part from dead matter and electrifies it into conscious being. Upon completing the experiment, however,\nhe's horrified at the result and flees. But time and space aren't enough\nto banish the abandoned monster, and the plot turns on a chilling chase\nbetween the two. Shelley subtitled her \nfireside ghost story, \"The Modern Prometheus.\" That's in reference to the Greek myth\nof the Titan Prometheus who stole fire from the gods\nand gave it to humanity. This gave humanity knowledge and power, but for tampering with the status quo, Prometheus was chained to a rock\nand eaten by vultures for eternity. Prometheus enjoyed a resurgence\nin the literature of the Romantic Period during the 18th century. Mary was a prominent Romantic, and shared the movement's appreciation for\nnature, emotion, and the purity of art. Two years after \nMary released \"Frankenstein\", Percy reimagined the plight\nof Prometheus in his lyrical drama, \"Prometheus Unbound.\" The Romantics used \nthese mythical references to signal the purity of the Ancient World\nin contrast to modernity. They typically regarded science\nwith suspicion, and \"Frankenstein\" is one of the first\ncautionary tales about artificial intelligence. For Shelley, the terror\nwas not supernatural, but born in a lab. In addition, gothic devices \ninfuse the text. The gothic genre is characterized\nby unease, eerie settings, the grotesque, and the fear of oblivion - all elements that can \nbe seen in \"Frankenstein.\" But this horror had roots \nin personal trauma, as well. The text is filled with references\nto Shelley's own circumstances. Born in 1797, Mary was the child\nof William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Both were radical intellectual figures, and her mother's book,\n\"A Vindication of the Rights of Women,\" is a key feminist text. Tragically, she died as a result of\ncomplications from Mary's birth. Mary was haunted by her mother's death, and later experienced her own\nproblems with childbirth. She became pregnant following\nher elopement with Percy at 16, but that baby died shortly after birth. Out of four more pregnancies,\nonly one of their children survived. Some critics have linked this tragedy\nto the themes explored in \"Frankenstein.\" Shelley depicts birth as both creative\nand destructive, and the monster becomes a disfigured\nmirror of the natural cycle of life. The monster, therefore, embodies\nDr. Frankenstein's corruption of nature in the quest for glory. This constitutes his fatal flaw, \nor hamartia. His god complex is most clear in the line, \"Life and death appear to me ideal bounds\nwhich I should first break through and pour a torrent of light\nonto our dark world.\" Although he accomplishes\nsomething awe-inspiring, he has played with fire at his own\nethical expense. And that decision echoes \nthroughout the novel, which is full of references to fire\nand imagery that contrasts light and dark. These moments suggest not only the spark\nof Prometheus's fire, but the power of radical ideas to expose\ndarker areas of life. "

        "text": "In the lush rainforests of Australia, birds roost in the low branches and amble across the forest floor, enjoying the shade and tropical fruits. But the jungle isn’t theirs alone. A dingo is prowling in the shadows, and fruit won’t satisfy his appetite. The birds flee to safety all but the cassowary, who can’t clear the ground on her puny wings. Instead, she attacks, sending the dingo running for cover with one swipe of her razor-sharp toe claws. The cassowary is one of approximately 60 living species of flightless birds. These earthbound avians live all over the world, from the Australian outback to the African savanna to Antarctic shores. They include some species of duck and all species of penguin, secretive swamp dwellers and speedy ostriches, giant emus, and tiny kiwis. Though the common ancestor of all modern birds could fly, many different bird species have independently lost their flight. Flight can have incredible benefits, especially for escaping predators, hunting, and traveling long distances. But it also has high costs: it consumes huge amounts of energy and limits body size and weight. A bird that doesn’t fly conserves energy, so it may be able to survive on a scarcer or less nutrient-rich food source than one that flies. The Takahe of New Zealand, for example, lives almost entirely on the soft base of alpine grasses. For birds that nest or feed on the ground, this predisposition to flightlessness can be even stronger. When a bird species doesn’t face specific pressures to fly, it can stop flying in as quickly as a few generations. Then, over thousands or millions of years, the birds’ bodies change to match this new behavior. Their bones, once hollow to minimize weight, become dense. Their sturdy feathers turn to fluff. Their wings shrink, and in some cases disappear entirely. And the keel-like protrusion on their sternums, where the flight muscles attach, shrinks or disappears, except in penguins, who repurpose their flight muscles and keels for swimming. Most often, flightlessness evolves after a bird species flies to an island where there are no predators. As long as these predator-free circumstances last, the birds thrive, but they are vulnerable to changes in their environment. For instance, human settlers bring dogs, cats, and stowaway rodents to islands. These animals often prey on flightless birds and can drive them to extinction. In New Zealand, stoats introduced by European settlers have threatened many native species of flightless bird. Some have gone extinct while others are endangered. So in spite of the energy-saving advantages of flightlessness, many flightless bird species have only a short run before going the way of the dodo. But a few flightless birds have survived on mainlands alongside predators aplenty. Unlike most small flightless species that come and go quickly, these giants have been flightless for tens of millions of years. Their ancestors appeared around the same time as the first small mammals, and they were probably able to survive because they were evolving— and growing—at the same time as their mammalian predators. Most of these birds, like emus and ostriches, ballooned in size, weighing hundreds of pounds more than wings can lift. Their legs grew thick, their feet sturdy, and newly developed thigh muscles turned them into formidable runners. Though they no longer use them to fly, many of these birds repurpose their wings for other means. They can be spotted tucking their heads beneath them for warmth, flashing them at prospective mates, sheltering eggs with them, or even using them to steer as they charge across the plains. They may be flightless, but they’re still winging it. "

        "text": "Over the course of the 1960s, the FBI amassed almost \ntwo thousand documents in an investigation into one \nof America’s most celebrated minds. The subject of this inquiry \nwas a writer named James Baldwin. At the time, the FBI investigated many \nartists and thinkers, but most of their files were a \nfraction the size of Baldwin’s. During the years when the FBI hounded him, he became one of the best-selling\nblack authors in the world. So what made James Baldwin loom \nso large in the imaginations of both the public and the authorities? Born in Harlem in 1924, he was the oldest of nine children. At age fourteen,\nhe began to work as a preacher. By delivering sermons,\nhe developed his voice as a writer, but also grew conflicted about the Church’s stance on racial inequality and homosexuality. After high school, he began writing novels and essays\nwhile taking a series of odd jobs. But the issues that had driven him \naway from the Church were still inescapable in his daily life. Constantly confronted with racism \nand homophobia, he was angry and disillusioned, \nand yearned for a less restricted life. So in 1948, \nat the age of 24, he moved to Paris on a writing fellowship. From France, he published his first novel, \"Go Tell it on the Mountain,\" in 1953. Set in Harlem, the book explores the Church \nas a source of both repression and hope. It was popular with both black \nand white readers. As he earned acclaim for his fiction, Baldwin gathered his thoughts on race, \nclass, culture and exile in his 1955 extended essay, \n\"Notes of a Native Son.\" Meanwhile, the Civil Rights movement \nwas gaining momentum in America. Black Americans were making incremental \ngains at registering to vote and voting, but were still denied basic dignities in \nschools, on buses, in the work force, and in the armed services. Though he lived primarily in France \nfor the rest of his life, Baldwin was deeply invested in \nthe movement, and keenly aware of his \ncountry’s unfulfilled promise. He had seen family, friends, \nand neighbors spiral into addiction, incarceration\nand suicide. He believed their fates originated \nfrom the constraints of a segregated society. In 1963, he published \"The Fire Next Time,\" an arresting portrait of racial strife in which he held white America \naccountable, but he also went further, arguing that racism hurt white people too. In his view, everyone was inextricably enmeshed \nin the same social fabric. He had long believed that: “People are trapped in history \nand history is trapped in them.” Baldwin’s role in the Civil Rights \nmovement went beyond observing and reporting. He also traveled through the \nAmerican South attending rallies giving lectures \nof his own. He debated both white politicians \nand black activists, including Malcolm X, and served as a liaison between black \nactivists and intellectuals and white establishment leaders \nlike Robert Kennedy. Because of Baldwin’s unique ability to articulate the causes \nof social turbulence in a way that white audiences \nwere willing to hear, Kennedy and others tended to see \nhim as an ambassador for black Americans — a label Baldwin rejected. And at the same time, his faculty with words led the \nFBI to view him as a threat. Even within the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin could sometimes feel \nlike an outsider for his choice to live abroad,\nas well as his sexuality, which he explored openly \nin his writing at a time when homophobia ran rampant. Throughout his life, Baldwin considered it his role\nto bear witness. Unlike many of his peers, he lived to see some of the\nvictories of the Civil Rights movement, but the continuing racial inequalities in \nthe United States weighed heavily on him. Though he may have felt trapped \nin his moment in history, his words have made generations \nof people feel known, while guiding them toward a more \nnuanced understanding of society’s most complex issues.

        "text": "How many people does it take to make\na cup of coffee? For many of us, all it takes is a short\nwalk and a quick pour. But this simple staple is the result \nof a globe-spanning process whose cost and complexity are far greater\nthan you might imagine. It begins in a place like the remote\nColombian town of Pitalito. Here, family farms have clear cut \nlocal forests to make room for neat rows of Coffea trees. These shrub-like plants \nwere first domesticated in Ethiopia and are now cultivated throughout\nequatorial regions. Each shrub is filled with small berries\ncalled \"coffee cherries.\" Since fruits on the same branch \ncan ripen at different times, they’re best picked by hand, but each farm has its own method\nfor processing the fruit. In Pitalito, harvesters toil \nfrom dawn to dusk at high altitudes, often picking over 25 kilograms per shift\nfor very low wages. The workers deliver their picked cherries\nto the wet mill. This machine separates the seeds\nfrom the fruit, and then sorts them by density. The heaviest, most flavorful seeds \nsink to the bottom of the mill, where they’re collected \nand taken to ferment in a tub of water for one or two days. Then, workers wash off the remaining fruit\nand put the seeds out to dry. Some farms use machines for this process, but in Pitalito, seeds are spread\nonto large mesh racks. Over the next three weeks, \nworkers rake the seeds regularly to ensure they dry evenly. Once the coffee beans are dry, a truck takes them to a nearby mill\nwith several specialized machines. An air blower re-sorts the seeds \nby density, an assortment of sieves filter \nthem by size, and an optical scanner sorts by color. At this point, professionals called\nQ-graders select samples of beans to roast and brew. In a process called \"cupping,\" \nthey evaluate the coffee’s taste, aroma, and mouthfeel to determine its quality. These experts give the beans a grade,\nand get them ready to ship. Workers load burlap sacks \ncontaining up to 70 kilograms of dried and sorted coffee beans\nonto steel shipping containers, each able to carry \nup to 21 metric tons of coffee. From tropical ports, cargo ships \ncrewed by over 25 people transport coffee around the world But no country imports more coffee\nthan the United States, with New York City alone consuming\nmillions of cups every day. After the long journey \nfrom Colombia to New Jersey, our coffee beans pass through customs. Once dockworkers unload the container, a fleet of eighteen-wheelers transport \nthe coffee to a nearby warehouse, and then to a roastery. Here the beans go into a roasting machine,\nstirred by a metallic arm and heated by a gas-powered fire. Nearby sensors monitor the coffee’s\nmoisture level, chemical stability, and temperature, while trained coffee\nengineers manually adjust these levels throughout the twelve-minute\nroasting cycle. This process releases oil within the seed, transforming the seeds into grindable,\nbrewable beans with a dark brown color and rich aroma. After roasting, workers pack the beans\ninto five-pound bags, which a fleet of vans deliver to cafes\nand stores across the city. The coffee is now so close \nyou can smell it, but it needs more help \nfor the final stretch. Each coffee company has a head buyer who carefully selects beans \nfrom all over the world. Logistics teams manage \nbean delivery routes, and brave baristas across the city\nserve this caffeinated elixir to scores of hurried customers. All in all, it takes hundreds of people\nto get coffee to its intended destination— and that’s not counting everyone\nmaintaining the infrastructure that makes the journey possible. Many of these individuals work \nfor low pay in dangerous conditions— and some aren’t paid at all. So while we might marvel at the global\nnetwork behind this commodity, let’s make sure we don’t value \nthe final product more than the people who make it. "

        "text": "You and your best friend Bill are \nthe greatest bards in the kingdom— but maybe not the brightest. The hit song you performed \nat last night’s fair insulted the king, and now your hours are numbered. Just before your execution, you’re approached by the princess,\nwho happens to be a big fan. She slips you a pouch containing\ntwo magic, six-sided dice that can land any way you wish. You have no idea how this could possibly\nhelp, but you thank her anyways. As everything goes dark, you both suddenly find yourself standing \nin a deep cavern before a robed figure. It turns out that Death is a connoisseur\nof most excellent music. He’s decided to give you a chance \nto escape your fate by beating him at his favorite game: \nlife-sized Snakes and Ladders. The cavern has 100 rooms connected \nby passageways as well as— you guessed it—\nsnakes and ladders. Each turn one of you will roll a die, \nthen advance that many rooms. Ending your move at the bottom \nof a ladder means moving up to the top, while ending on a snake’s head\nwill make you slide down to its tail. Each of you must make your way\nthrough the cavern and reach the exit in fewer turns\nthan Death himself. Before you can think twice,\nyour host starts casting his die, and within 6 rolls he’s reached \nthe cavern entrance. “Better get moving,” he says. “Oh, and by the way, once one \nof you uses a snake or ladder, it’ll disappear and be inaccessible\nto the other.” You have no idea how you can possibly\nget lucky enough to win, but then you remember your magic dice. Can you figure out a sequence of rolls\nthat will get both of you to the exit in 5 or fewer moves each? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The cavern contains many\nroutes to the exit, and it’s natural to gravitate \nto the ladders that allow you to cover a lot of ground, \nquickly. Like this one— on turn 2 you’d be at 75, but without any further ladder boosts,\nyou’d need another 5 rolls to get out. Or this one— three ladders get you to 82, but then it would take another 4 rolls\nto get around the pesky snake at 88. In fact, there’s no path\nthat can get you to the exit in 5 moves using exclusively ladders. So where does that leave you? Snakes. It’s counterintuitive to make\nmoves that take you farther away from your target, but snakes open up a surprising amount \nof opportunities. For instance, these three ladders would\nput you a single roll from the exit, but cost too many turns\nto reach by ladders. These two are, however, only 5 and 12\nrooms from snake tails, respectively. So could you work backwards from those\nto find a 5 roll path? There are exactly two 5-turn routes\nyou might find using these ladders: Ladder snake snake ladder exit, and ladder ladder snake ladder exit. So that’s it, right? \nUnfortunately, no— the two paths share a snake and a ladder, each of which will be unusable after \nthe first of you slides and then climbs. You won’t find 5-turn\nmoves anywhere else, so is one of you doomed? There’s one more possibility to consider: the disappearing ladders and snakes\ncan impede your progress, but could they also help it? There are two paths to the 94 ladder\nthat almost work, except for this snake, at exactly the midpoint \nbetween the two ladders. If Bill were to take that snake \non his route, you could then get past it \nand up to the exit in just 5 moves. And good news— \nwhichever path you choose, one of the 5-roll paths we found\nearlier does exactly that without using any \nof your snakes or ladders. So all you need is for Bill to go first\nand stick to the plan. You and Bill both reach \nthe cavern entrance and climb back into the public square,\nto everyone’s surprise. Before the guards can seize you again, you wow the crowd— and king— with a song\nabout your epic contest with Death. "

Teflon's properties make it perfect\nwhen you need something slippery, chemical resistant, or waterproof, which means it has a lot of applications. It can be found all over the place, as a coating on raincoats, industrial ball bearings, artificial joints, circuit boards, and even the Rocky Mountains-themed roof\nof the Denver International Airport. The incredible properties of PTFE\ncome from its molecular structure. It's a polymer, meaning it's made of long chains of\nrepeating units of atoms strung together. A PTFE chain has a backbone \nof carbon atoms, each of which is attached \nto two fluorines. The fluorine atoms surround the carbon\nlike armor, spiraling around the chain, and the bond between carbon and fluorine\nis incredibly tight. Like a couple that ignores everyone\nexcept each other, carbon and fluorine interact so strongly that the normal, intermolecular forces\nthat help substances stick to each other don't stand a chance. Even the famously adhesive feet of geckos\nusually can't get a grip. But wait! If PTFE doesn't stick to anything, how can it be so firmly attached\nto something like a pan? One method involves sandblasting the pan or etching it with chemicals \nto make it rough. Then, a special primer is applied,\nwhich acts like glue. Its exact composition is a trade secret\nguarded by each manufacturer. The pan is sprayed with liquid PTFE and heated to around \n800 degrees Fahrenheit. The layers then solidify into\na smooth, slick coating. When you later cook eggs\nin this PTFE-coated pan, the extra tight carbon-fluorine bonds just ignore the water and fat and protein\nmolecules in the eggs. Without those interactions, the food just slides around \nwithout sticking. You might wonder if it's safe to cook\nin a PTFE-coated pan. The answer is yes, if you're careful. PTFE is stable at moderate temperatures,\nlike you'd use to cook eggs or fish, but above 500 degrees Fahrenheit,\nit starts to degrade, and heating it further releases fumes\nthat can make you feel sick. An empty pan can reach 500 degrees fast\nover high heat, but most kitchens are ventilated \nwell enough to dissipate the fumes. People used to also think \nthat accidentally consuming PTFE that flaked off a scratched pan\nwas bad for you, but the current consensus \nis that it's harmless. Because PTFE doesn't interact with other\nchemicals very well, it isn't thought to break down\ninside your body. Whether it's safe to manufacture Teflon\nis another story. DuPont and its spin-off company Chemours now face lawsuits \nworth millions of dollars. They've been accused of polluting\nthe environment for decades and exposing employees \nand local communities to health risks associated \nwith a toxic chemical called PFOA. That chemical was involved\nin manufacturing Teflon. As for John Gotti, in 1992, the Mob boss was finally \nconvicted of five counts of murder, among other charges. That prompted the head of the FBI office\nin New York City to announce, \"The Teflon is gone. The don is covered in Velcro,\nand all the charges stuck.\" "

        "text": "In the Egyptian Book of the Dead,\nthere’s a banishment spell that declares, “Be far from me, \nO vile cockroach.” More than 3,000 years later, \nwe’re still trying to oust these insects. But from poison traps \nto hastily brandished slippers, cockroaches seem to weather \njust about everything we throw at them. So what makes cockroaches so hard to kill? There are nearly 5,000 cockroach species. 99% of them live in a range of habitats\nwhere they play important ecological roles by recycling dead or decaying \norganic matter and nourishing other animals. But a couple dozen species adapted to live\nin close association with humans. German and American cockroaches\nare among the most common. And they owe their resilience\nto a combination of physical and chemical adaptations. When it comes to old-fashioned \nremoval methods, they're troublingly tenacious. An American cockroach’s sensory hairs \nor structures pick up subtle air currents and rapidly send signals \nto its central nervous system. The roach can then turn and sprint\naway within a few milliseconds. And it’s among the fastest invertebrates\never recorded, reaching speeds of up to 50\nbody lengths per second. This would be the human equivalent of\nrunning more than 300 kilometers per hour. And finding a hiding place is no problem. With its flattened, flexible body, an American cockroach can squeeze into \nspaces less than a quarter of its height. Even if we do land a hit, \nit can withstand compressive forces of up to 900 times its own weight \nby distributing the impact along its body. And the cockroach’s toughness\ndoesn’t end there. Cockroaches can eat a variety \nof organic matter, including hair, dead skin, \nadhesives, and paper. This is made possible by an expansive set \nof digestive enzymes. Cockroaches are able to thrive \neven in nutrient-poor environments. Roaches often eat decaying foods\nthat are low in nitrogen— an essential component\nof DNA and proteins. But they survive by storing \nnitrogen-containing wastes in their bodies and having a resident group\nof bacteria recycle the nitrogen into useful molecules for them. Meanwhile, German cockroaches\nwill eat their own poop, vomit, and dead or dying colony members \nwithout hesitation. An American cockroach will\nfrolic in sewers, consuming excrement and toting microbes\nlike Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli. But they’ll rarely suffer\nany consequences. This is because they’re equipped \nwith genes that provide immunity against numerous pathogens. These genes are often duplicated \nmany times over. So when infected, the cockroach’s \nimmune system efficiently unleashes many antimicrobial molecules. Cockroaches also have a slew of defenses\nagainst pesticides. When a non-resistant roach walks \non a surface that’s been sprayed with a pyrethroid insecticide, \nfor example, the results will likely be fatal. Once absorbed, the chemical binds\nto sodium channel proteins, which help propagate nerve impulses. The pyrethroid keeps \nthe sodium channels open, so the nerves fire repeatedly. And soon, the cockroach dies. But if a resistant roach is exposed \nto pyrethroids, it’ll be just fine. Genetic mutations have given\nthem sodium channels that the pyrethroids can’t bind to. The cockroach also produces more\ndetoxification enzymes, which render the pesticide harmless, and the cockroach simply excretes \nit as a waste. Because German cockroaches\nreproduce especially quickly, populations may evolve resistance \nto a new pesticide within months. So far, they're already resistant\nto 43 different chemicals. But contrary to popular belief, cockroaches would probably not survive \na nuclear apocalypse. Compared with other insects, cockroaches are only mildly\ntolerant to radiation. They would die near the sites\nof nuclear explosions and would still be severely\ncompromised miles away. Moreover, disasters that threaten humanity also jeopardize the habitats and buffets \nwe provide roaches. Perhaps the only way to beat them \nis through our mutual destruction. Or maybe cockroaches would find \neven more surprising ways to thrive long after we’re gone. "

        "text": "On January 17, 1920, six armed men \nrobbed a Chicago freight train. But it wasn’t money they were after. Less than one hour after spirits \nhad become illegal throughout the United States, the robbers made off with thousands \nof dollars worth of whiskey. It was a first taste of the unintended \nconsequences of Prohibition. The nationwide ban on the production \nand sale of alcohol in the United States came on the heels \nof a similar ban in Russia that started as a wartime measure \nduring World War I. But the view in the Western world \nof alcohol as a primary cause of social ills \nwas much older. It first gained traction \nduring the Industrial Revolution as new populations of workers \npoured into cities and men gathered in saloons to drink. By the 19th century, anti-drinking groups\ncalled temperance movements began to appear in the United States \nand parts of Europe. Temperance groups believed \nthat alcohol was the fundamental driver behind problems like poverty \nand domestic violence, and set out to convince \ngovernments of this. While some simply advocated \nmoderate drinking, many believed alcohol \nshould be banned entirely. These movements drew support \nfrom broad sectors of society. Women’s organizations were active \nparticipants from the beginning, arguing that alcohol made men neglect\ntheir families and abuse their wives. Religious authorities, \nespecially Protestants, denounced alcohol \nas leading to temptation and sin. Progressive labor activists \nbelieved alcohol consumption harmed workers’ ability to organize. Governments weren’t strangers \nto the idea of prohibition, either. In the United States and Canada, \nwhite settlers introduced hard liquors like rum to Native communities, then blamed alcohol for disrupting \nthese communities— though there were many other \ndestructive aspects of their interactions. The American and Canadian governments\nbanned the sale of alcohol to Native populations \nand on reservation land. American temperance movements gained\ntheir first victories at the state and local levels, with Maine and several other states \nbanning the sale and production of liquor in the 1850s. In 1919 the 18th Amendment \nto the US Constitution banned the manufacture, sale, \nand transportation of all alcoholic beverages. The amendment took effect a year later\nunder the Volstead Act. Since the act did not ban \npersonal consumption, wealthy people took the opportunity \nto stock up while restaurants and bars rushed to sell their remaining supply. Workers lost their jobs as distilleries, \nbreweries, and wineries closed down. Meanwhile, organized crime groups \nrushed to meet the demand for alcohol, establishing a lucrative black market \nin producing, smuggling, and selling illicit liquor. Often they worked side-by side \nwith corrupt policemen and government officials, even bombing the 1928 primary election\nfor Illinois state attorney in support of a particular \npolitical faction. Tens of thousands of illegal bars, \nknown as \"speakeasies,\" began serving alcohol. They ranged from dingy basement bars \nto elaborate dance-halls. People could also make alcohol \nat home for their own consumption, or obtain it legally with a doctor’s \nprescription or for religious purposes. To prevent industrial alcohol \nfrom being consumed, the government required manufacturers\nto add harmful chemicals, leading to thousands of poisoning deaths. We don’t know exactly how much people\nwere drinking during Prohibition because illegal alcohol \nwasn’t regulated or taxed. But by the late 1920s, it was clear that Prohibition \nhad not brought the social improvements it had promised. Instead it contributed to political \ncorruption and organized crime and was flouted by millions of citizens. At one raid on an Detroit beer hall, \nthe local sheriff, mayor and a congressman were arrested for drinking. With the start of the Great \nDepression in 1929, the government sorely needed the tax\nrevenue from alcohol sales, and believed that lifting Prohibition \nwould stimulate the economy. In 1933, Congress passed the 21st\nAmendment repealing the 18th— the only amendment to be fully repealed. Members of the temperance movements believed that alcohol \nwas the root of society’s problems, but the reality is more complicated. And while banning it completely \ndidn’t work, the health and social impacts \nof alcohol remain concerns today. "

        "text": "A throbbing, pounding headache. Bright zigzagging lines \nacross your field of vision. Sensitivity to light, lingering fatigue, \ndisrupted sleep. A migraine can include any\nof these symptoms. While an incapacitating headache is one of\nthe most common experiences of migraine, the word “headache” doesn’t really capture\nthe wide array of experiences a migraine can entail. No two are alike,\nand some don’t even involve a headache. So what then is a migraine?\nWhat’s happening in the brain to cause it? To trace a migraine’s anatomy, we have to begin in the days and hours \nleading up to a migraine, when people often identify warning signs \nranging from fatigue or mood changes, to bursts of yawning,\nsleep disruption, nausea, light and sound sensitivity,\nor even increased thirst. These warning signs point \nto a particular part of the brain: the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus normally controls \nthe systems behind these symptoms— our body’s internal hormonal balances,\ncircadian rhythms and water regulation. It has wide connections\nthroughout the brain, and is more active than usual\nin the days before migraine. Another common warning sign\nis the migraine aura, which can take the form \nof transient visual changes, tingling, or even trouble speaking. These sensations come from a change \nin charge across cell membranes that leads to spreading changes in brain \nactivity and blood flow across the brain. We don't know what triggers\nthis change in charge, but it can spread quickly \nover the surface of the brain, causing different aura symptoms \ndepending on the affected area. If it inches over the visual cortex,\nfor example, it may cause an image or blind spot\nto spread over the visual field. During the headache phase, \nthe trigeminal nerve plays a key role. The trigeminal nerve normally transmits \ntouch, temperature, and other sensations from the skin to most of the face, \npart of the scalp, and some of the blood vessels\nand layers covering the cerebral cortex. Once activated, the trigeminal nerve\ntransmits pain signals. During a migraine, this pain pathway \nbecomes sensitized, meaning the threshold for provoking\npain is lowered. Sensations that would usually \nbe pain-free, such as coughing, bending over, \nor light and sound, can become painful. Migraines are as common\nas they are diverse, affecting as many as 33% of women\nand 13% of men in their lifetimes. Still, there’s much we don’t know \nabout them. We can see that migraine \nis a neurological disorder affecting multiple parts of the brain— the brainstem, cerebral hemispheres,\nand the nerves themselves. But we don't know for sure what\nexactly triggers each step, why some people get migraines\nand not others, why so many more women do than men, or why people’s migraine patterns\nsometimes change over their lifetimes. Hormonal fluctuations are thought to have\na role in some of these things: some women experience a significant\nreduction in migraine frequency after menopause, \nwhen sex hormone fluctuations are fewer. Meanwhile, just before menopause,\nthese fluctuations increase, and some women experience \nworsening or new headaches. People with migraines\nare more likely to suffer from depression, panic disorder, sleep disorders, \nand strokes, among other illnesses. The relationship with these diseases\nis likely complex, possibly reflecting the effect of migraine\non those diseases or vice versa, or reflecting their shared genetic basis. Genetics almost certainly play a role,\nalthough with a few exceptions, there’s no single gene \nthat causes migraines. Certain genes control how easily \nour brains’ neurons are excited by environmental stimuli and \nhow readily they transmit painful signals. It’s possible that the neurons in the \nbrains of people who experience migraines are more easily triggered \nby environmental stimuli and less likely to block painful signals. While there’s no simple way to explain \nwhat happens in our brains with this complex disorder, one thing is for sure:\nmigraine is much more than a headache. "

        "text": "The animal kingdom boasts \nan incredible diversity of eyes. Some rotate independently, while others\nhave squiggly-shaped pupils. Some have protective lids,\nothers squirt blood. But which creature has the best sight? Which sees best in the darkness? Which sees the most detail? Which animal sees the most color? And finally, \nwhich detects motion the fastest? All eyes take in sensory stimuli\nin the form of waves of light. To convert these into everything we see, eyes focus incoming light\nonto photoreceptors. These cells translate light \ninto neural signals and send them to the brain, \nwhere they’re finally processed. The eyes that see best in darkness\nare those that capture as much available light as possible. Colossal squids have \nsoccer-ball-sized eyes— the largest known in existence. These may help them spot \nthe faint glow of sperm whales as they disturb light-producing organisms. Some fish have eyes that are unique among\nvertebrates because they use mirrors. For the brownsnout spookfish, each eye has an upward-facing lens \nand a downward-pointing mirror composed of tiny crystal plates \nthat efficiently gather light. They can see up and down simultaneously, and may perceive distinct shapes, \neven in the ocean’s depths. Back on solid ground, \narctic reindeer have adaptations to deal with months of darkness. The backs of reindeer eyes change color,\nfrom gold in summer to blue in winter. Their blue-backed eyes are about \n1,000 times more sensitive to light. This may allow reindeer to recognize\nimportant things in the snow like urine and lichen. When it comes to the sharpest vision,\nbirds of prey soar above the competition. To capture the most detail, an animal must\nhave lots of photoreceptors in its eye, as well as increased \nvisual processing power. Raptors have an especially deep fovea— a depression in the back of their eye\nthat fits more photoreceptors. So, Peregrine falcons have vision that’s\nmore than twice as sharp as a human’s. They’re able to zero in on a rabbit \nfrom more than three kilometers away. When crowning the creature \nwith the best color vision, the picture gets complicated. Different photoreceptors are sensitive\nto specific waves of light, meaning the colors we see \nare largely determined by what kinds of photoreceptors we have. Presumably, the more types of color \nphotoreceptors an animal has, the better its color vision. Dogs have just two types. Humans have three. And we are far outdone\nby some birds, fishes, and insects. Bluebottle butterflies have at least\n15 types of photoreceptors. Seven of them are attuned \nto distinct blues and greens, which researchers think might help them\ntrack each other during high-speed chases. Mantis shrimp have a whopping\n16 kinds of photoreceptors, with five reserved just for the \nultraviolet, or UV, spectrum, which humans can’t see. But experiments suggest \nthat the mantis shrimp’s ability to discriminate between colors \nis more limited than you might expect. Exactly how they use their complex eyes\nis a mystery. Meanwhile, with just four kinds\nof color photoreceptors, goldfish actually excel at discerning\nsubtle differences in shades. Finally, insects have mastered the ability\nto see the world... on the fly. The fastest motion vision \nrequires photoreceptors that quickly sense changes in light, and a brain that rapidly\nprocesses the information. A movie shot at 24 frames per second\ngives us the perception of near seamless motion. But insects would see a slideshow. Fly photoreceptors register changes \n10 times faster than we do, making them especially hard to catch. These animals have some \nof the best vision we know of, but there's no winner across the board. Each category has different top contenders\nbecause vision requires tradeoffs. So, some eyes are highly specialized, while others, like ours, \nperform decently in many categories. From eyes the size of soccer balls \nto those that see in UV— the ways of looking at the world \nare as varied as the life forms in it. "

        "text": "One of the most amazing facts \nin physics is this: everything in the universe, from light\nto electrons to atoms, behaves like both a particle and a wave\nat the same time. All of the other weird stuff you might\nhave heard about quantum physics, Schrodinger's Cat, God playing dice,\nspooky action at a distance, all of it follows directly from the fact that everything has both \nparticle and wave nature. This might sound crazy. If you look around, you'll see waves\nin water and particles of rock, and they're nothing alike. So why would you think to combine them? Physicists didn't just decide to mash\nthese things together out of no where. Rather, they were led to \nthe dual nature of the universe through a process of small steps, fitting together lots of bits of evidence,\nlike pieces in a puzzle. The first person to seriously \nsuggest the dual nature of light was Albert Einstein in 1905, but he was picking up an \nearlier idea from Max Planck. Planck explained the colors of light\nemitted by hot objects, like the filament in a light bulb, but to do it, he needed a desperate trick: he said the object was \nmade up of oscillators that could only emit light\nin discrete chunks, units of energy that depend on \nthe frequency of the light. Planck was never really happy with this,\nbut Einstein picked it up and ran with it. He applied Planck's idea to light itself,\nsaying that light, which everybody knew was a wave,\nis really a stream of photons, each with a discrete amount of energy. Einstein himself called this\nthe only truly revolutionary thing he did, but it explains the way light shining on \na metal surface knocks loose electrons. Even people who hated the idea\nhad to agree that it works brilliantly. The next puzzle piece came from \nErnest Rutherford in England. In 1909, Ernest Marsden and Hans Geiger,\nworking for Rutherford, shot alpha particles at gold atoms and were stunned to find that some\nbounced straight backwards. This showed that most of the mass of the \natom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus. The cartoon atom you learn \nin grade school, with electrons orbiting\nlike a miniature solar system, that's Rutherford's. There's one little problem with\nRutherford's atom: it can't work. Classical physics tells us\nthat an electron whipping around in a circle emits light, and we use this all the time\nto generate radio waves and X-rays. Rutherford's atoms should spray X-rays\nin all directions for a brief instant before the electron spirals in\nto crash into the nucleus. But Niels Bohr, a Danish theoretical\nphysicist working with Rutherford, pointed out that atoms obviously exist, so maybe the rules of physics \nneeded to change. Bohr proposed that an electron\nin certain special orbits doesn't emit any light at all. Atoms absorb and emit light\nonly when electrons change orbits, and the frequency of the light\ndepends on the energy difference in just the way Planck\nand Einstein introduced. Bohr's atom fixes Rutherford's problem and explains why atoms emit only\nvery specific colors of light. Each element has its own special orbits, and thus its own unique\nset of frequencies. The Bohr model has one tiny problem: there's no reason for \nthose orbits to be special. But Louis de Broglie, \na French PhD student, brought everything full circle. He pointed out that if light,\nwhich everyone knew is a wave, behaves like a particle, maybe the electron, \nwhich everyone knew is a particle, behaves like a wave. And if electrons are waves, it's easy to explain Bohr's rule\nfor picking out the special orbits. Once you have the idea that \nelectrons behave like waves, you can go look for it. And within a few years, \nscientists in the US and UK had observed wave behavior from electrons. These days we have a wonderfully clear\ndemonstration of this: shooting single electrons at a barrier\nwith slits cut in it. Each electron is detected \nat a specific place at a specific time, like a particle. But when you repeat the experiment\nmany times, all the individual electrons trace out\na pattern of stripes, characteristic of wave behavior. The idea that particles behave like waves,\nand vice versa, is one of the strangest\nand most powerful in physics. Richard Feynman famously said that this illustrates the central mystery\nof quantum mechanics. Everything else follows from this, like pieces of a puzzle \nfalling into place. "

        "text": "Socrates, one of the founding fathers\nof Western philosophical thought, was on trial. Many Athenians believed \nhe was a dangerous enemy of the state, accusing the philosopher\nof corrupting the youth and refusing to recognize their gods. However, Socrates wasn’t feared \nfor claiming to have all the answers, but rather, for asking too many questions. While he loathed formal lectures, the philosopher frequently\nengaged friends and strangers in lengthy conversations\nabout morality and society. These discussions weren’t debates,\nnor would Socrates offer explicit advice. In fact, the philosopher often claimed\nto know nothing at all, responding to his partner's answers\nonly with further questions. But through this process, \nSocrates probed their logic, revealing its flaws and helping both\nparties reach a more robust understanding. These insightful questions made Socrates\nbeloved by his followers. Two of his students, Plato and Xenophon,\nwere so inspired that they replicated their mentor’s \nprocess in fictional dialogues. These invented exchanges\nprovide perfect examples of what would come to be known \nas the Socratic Method. In one of these fabricated dialogues, Socrates is conversing with \na young man named Euthydemus, who is confident that he understands \nthe nature of justice and injustice. Socrates probes the student’s values\nby asking him to label actions such as lying and theft \nas just or unjust. Euthydemus confidently categorizes\nthem as injustices, but this only prompts another question: is it just for a general to deceive\nor pillage a hostile army? Euthydemus revises his assertion. He claims that these actions \nare just when done to enemies, and unjust when done to friends. But Socrates isn’t finished. He asks the young man to consider \na commander lying to his troops to boost their morale. Before long, Euthydemus is despondent. It seems that every answer\nleads to further problems, and perhaps he’s not quite sure\nwhat constitutes justice after all. In employing this\nquestion-oriented approach, Socrates described himself as a midwife, whose inquiries assist others\nin giving birth to their ideas. His method of questioning draws out an\nindividual’s unexamined assumptions, and then challenges those biases. It doesn't always provide\ndefinitive answers, but the method helps clarify the questions and eliminate contradictory \nor circular logic. And by following a line of inquiry \nwhere it logically leads, both the question asker and answerer\ncan end up in unexpected places. This technique isn’t limited \nby the conversation’s content, making it incredibly useful\nin numerous fields. During the Renaissance, the method was\nused to teach clinical medicine. Students proposed their rationale\nfor different diagnoses, while a doctor questioned their\nassumptions and moderated discussion. In this model, the method could even\nproduce conclusive results. This same approach was later used\nin other sciences, such as astronomy, botany, \nand mathematics. Following the Protestant Reformation, it was adapted to tackle abstract\nquestions of faith. In the 19th century, the method \nbecame an essential part of American legal education. Professors explored students’ \nunderstanding of judicial reasoning by challenging them with unforeseen\nhypothetical situations. This approach is still used today\nby the Supreme Court to imagine the unintended impacts \nof passing a law. The Socratic Method can be adapted \nto teach almost any topic that relies on critical reasoning, but its success depends on the teacher \nemploying it. An effective Socratic educator \nmust be well versed in their subject. Rather than bullying their students\nor showing off their superior intellect, they should be modest, genuinely curious, \nand affirming of every contribution. In this regard, Socrates himself may not have been \nthe most subtle Socratic teacher. Historians believe he was deeply critical\nof Athens’ particular brand of democracy, and known to pass those concerns\nonto his followers. These subversive beliefs were\ndistorted in public forums and thought to have inspired \ntwo of his pupils to treasonous ends. It was likely for these ideas\nSocrates was brought to trial, and eventually, \nsentenced to death. But even on his deathbed, artists depict\na serene philosopher— ever curious to explore \nthe ultimate question. "

        "text": "Towering 85 meters above the Norwegian\ncountryside, Mjøstårnet cuts a sleek shape \nin the rural skyline. Housing 18 stories of restaurants,\napartments, and hotel rooms, this modern building might\nseem out of place. But a deeper look reveals it actually\nblends in quite well among the forested farmlands. This is likely because Mjøstårnet \nis the world’s tallest wooden building, made almost entirely from the trees\nof neighboring forests. Until the end of the 20th century, engineers thought it was\nimpossible to build a wooden building over six stories tall. Traditional boards of lumber were fairly\nstrong against forces parallel to the wood’s fiber growth. But they were vulnerable to forces applied\nperpendicular to this direction. As a result, wood lacked \nsteel’s tensile strength or concrete’s compressive strength— each necessary to support tall buildings and battle the powerful winds found\nat high altitudes. But the early 1890s saw the invention \nof glue laminated timber, or glulam. And a century later, engineers developed\ncross-laminated timber, or CLT These new wooden materials start\nout like all other lumber; a freshly cut log is sawed\ninto smooth uniform boards of wood. Then, in the case of CLT, the boards are \nglued together in alternating orientations with each layer set\nat 90 degrees to its neighbors. The resulting material benefits \nfrom wood’s structural rigidity in every direction, allowing it to mimic the compressive\nstrength of concrete and bear loads up to 20 times heavier\nthan traditional lumber. Glulam on the other hand, glues boards\ntogether in the same direction, forming massive beams with tensile\nstrength comparable to steel. Glulam isn’t as versatile as CLT, but its incredible strength \nalong one direction makes it superior for load-bearing beams and columns. These engineered forms of wood could\nfinally compete with traditional materials while also bringing their own unique set \nof advantages. At one-fifth the weight of concrete, building with CLT requires smaller cranes,\nsmaller foundations, and fewer construction workers. While concrete has to undergo \na time-intensive process of casting and curing in a mold, timber can be shaped quickly using \ncomputer directed cutting machines. And where concrete requires \ncertain weather and timing conditions to be poured on site, engineered wood can be prefabricated\nin a factory, creating standardized parts with clear\ninstructions for assembly. Taken together, these materials allow\nfor faster and quieter construction, with more biodegradable materials\nand less waste. Once constructed, CLT and glulam buildings\nare also more resilient to some natural disasters. An earthquake can crack concrete, \npermanently weakening an entire structure. But cracked wood panels can\nbe easily replaced. The same is true for fire safety. As temperatures rise in a CLT building,\nthe material’s outer layer will char, insulating the inner layers\nfor up to three hours. This is more than enough time\nto evacuate most buildings, and once the smoke has settled, \ncharred panels can be swapped out— unlike melted steel beams. But perhaps the biggest benefits \nof CLT and glulam are outside the construction site. Building construction is responsible \nfor 11% of annual global carbon emissions, and the production of steel, concrete, \niron, and glass are major contributors to that figure. Timber, however, is a renewable resource\nthat can be made carbon-neutral if trees are planted to replace \nthose cut down. Wood also has low thermal conductivity, making it easier to heat and cool\nbuildings with less energy waste. Despite these advantages, CLT requires\nvastly more lumber than traditional wooden construction. And when compared in similar quantities, neither CLT or glulam is as strong \nas steel or concrete. Even Mjøstårnet isn’t made \nentirely of wood, as it contains concrete slabs \nto reinforce the upper floors. Taken together, it’s unlikely that \na purely wooden structure would be strong enough to support \na 40-story building— the minimum height \nfor a formal skyscraper. But even if only buildings \nunder 30 stories were built from wood, it would reduce the carbon footprint \nof those structures by more than 25%. So no matter how tall these\nwooden buildings rise, each one contributes to the health\nof our concrete jungles. "

        "text": "In 1967, researchers from around the world gathered to answer \na long-running scientific question— just how long is a second? It might seem obvious at first. A second is the tick of a clock, the swing of a pendulum, \nthe time it takes to count to one. But how precise are those measurements? What is that length based on? And how can we scientifically define\nthis fundamental unit of time? For most of human history, \nancient civilizations measured time with unique calendars that tracked the steady march\nof the night sky. In fact, the second as we know it wasn’t\nintroduced until the late 1500’s, when the Gregorian calendar \nbegan to spread across the globe alongside British colonialism. The Gregorian calendar defined a day\nas a single revolution of the Earth about its axis. Each day could be divided into 24 hours,\neach hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds. However, when it was first defined, the second was more of a mathematical\nidea than a useful unit of time. Measuring days and hours was sufficient\nfor most tasks in pastoral communities. It wasn’t until society became\ninterconnected through fast-moving railways that cities\nneeded to agree on exact timekeeping. By the 1950’s, numerous global systems\nrequired every second to be perfectly accounted for,\nwith as much precision as possible. And what could be more precise\nthan the atomic scale? As early as 1955, researchers began\nto develop atomic clocks, which relied on the unchanging laws\nof physics to establish a new foundation\nfor timekeeping. An atom consists of negatively charged\nelectrons orbiting a positively charged nucleus\nat a consistent frequency. The laws of quantum mechanics \nkeep these electrons in place, but if you expose an atom \nto an electromagnetic field such as light or radio waves, you can slightly disturb an electron’s\norientation. And if you briefly tweak an electron\nat just the right frequency, you can create a vibration \nthat resembles a ticking pendulum. Unlike regular pendulums that quickly lose\nenergy, electrons can tick for centuries. To maintain consistency and make ticks \neasier to measure, researchers vaporize the atoms, converting them to a less interactive\nand volatile state. But this process doesn’t slow down\nthe atom’s remarkably fast ticking. Some atoms can oscillate \nover nine billion times per second, giving atomic clocks an unparalleled\nresolution for measuring time. And since every atom of a given\nelemental isotope is identical, two researchers using the same element\nand the same electromagnetic wave should produce perfectly\nconsistent clocks. But before timekeeping could\ngo fully atomic, countries had to decide which atom \nwould work best. This was the discussion in 1967, at the Thirteenth General Conference \nof the International Committee for Weights and Measures. There are 118 elements\non the periodic table, each with their own unique properties. For this task, the researchers were\nlooking for several things. The element needed to have long-lived and high frequency electron oscillation\nfor precise, long-term timekeeping. To easily track this oscillation, it also needed to have a reliably\nmeasurable quantum spin— meaning the orientation of the axis\nabout which the electron rotates— as well as a simple energy\nlevel structure— meaning the active electrons are few\nand their state is simple to identify. Finally, it needed to be easy to vaporize. The winning atom? Cesium-133. Cesium was already a popular\nelement for atomic clock research, and by 1968, some cesium clocks\nwere even commercially available. All that was left was to determine\nhow many ticks of a cesium atom were in a second. The conference used the most\nprecise astronomical measurement of a second available at the time— beginning with the number of days\nin a year and dividing down. When compared to the atom’s ticking rate, the results formally defined one second as exactly 9,192,631,770 ticks\nof a cesium-133 atom. Today, atomic clocks are used all over\nthe Earth— and beyond it. From radio signal transmitters \nto satellites for global positioning systems, these devices have been synchronized to help us maintain a globally\nconsistent time— with precision that’s second to none.

        "text": "In 1800, the explorer \nAlexander von Humboldt witnessed a swarm of electric eels\nleap out of the water to defend themselves \nagainst oncoming horses. Most people thought the story\nso unusual that Humboldt made it up. But fish using electricity is more common\nthan you might think; and yes, electric eels are a type of fish. Underwater, where light is scarce, electrical signals offer ways\nto communicate, navigate, and find—plus, in rare cases, stun—prey. Nearly 350 species of fish\nhave specialized anatomical structures that generate \nand detect electrical signals. These fish are divided into two groups, depending on how much \nelectricity they produce. Scientists call the first group\nthe weakly electric fish. Structures near their tails \ncalled electric organs produce up to a volt of electricity,\nabout two-thirds as much as a AA battery. How does this work? The fish's brain sends a signal through\nits nervous system to the electric organ, which is filled with stacks of hundreds or thousands of disc-shaped \ncells called electrocytes. Normally, electrocytes pump out sodium\nand potassium ions to maintain a positive charge outside\nand negative charge inside. But when the nerve signal arrives\nat the electrocyte, it prompts the ion gates to open. Positively charged ions flow back in. Now, one face of the electrocyte\nis negatively charged outside and positively charged inside. But the far side \nhas the opposite charge pattern. These alternating charges \ncan drive a current, turning the electrocyte \ninto a biological battery. The key to these fish's powers \nis that nerve signals are coordinated to arrive at each cell \nat exactly the same time. That makes the stacks of electrocytes\nact like thousands of batteries in series. The tiny charges from each one\nadd up to an electrical field that can travel several meters. Cells called electroreceptors\nburied in the skin allow the fish to constantly sense\nthis field and the changes to it caused \nby the surroundings or other fish. The Peter’s elephantnose fish, \nfor example, has an elongated chin\ncalled a schnauzenorgan that's riddled in electroreceptors. That allows it to intercept signals\nfrom other fish, judge distances, detect the shape and size\nof nearby objects, and even determine whether\na buried insect is dead or alive. But the elephantnose\nand other weakly electric fish don't produce enough electricity\nto attack their prey. That ability belongs \nto the strongly electric fish, of which there are only \na handful of species. The most powerful strongly electric\nfish is the electric knife fish, more commonly known as the electric eel. Three electric organs span\nalmost its entire two-meter body. Like the weakly electric fish, the electric eel uses its signals\nto navigate and communicate, but it reserves its strongest \nelectric discharges for hunting using a two-phased attack that susses out\nand then incapacitates its prey. First, it emits two \nor three strong pulses, as much as 600 volts. These stimulate the prey's muscles,\nsending it into spasms and generating waves \nthat reveal its hiding place. Then, a volley of fast, \nhigh-voltage discharges causes even more intense \nmuscle contractions. The electric eel can also curl up\nso that the electric fields generated at each end \nof the electric organ overlap. The electrical storm eventually\nexhausts and immobilizes the prey, and the electric eel \ncan swallow its meal alive. The other two strongly electric fish\nare the electric catfish, which can unleash 350 volts with an electric organ \nthat occupies most of its torso, and the electric ray, with kidney-shaped\nelectric organs on either side of its head that produce as much as 220 volts. There is one mystery in the world\nof electric fish: why don't they electrocute themselves? It may be that the size \nof strongly electric fish allows them to withstand their own shocks, or that the current passes out \nof their bodies too quickly. Some scientists think that special \nproteins may shield the electric organs, but the truth is, this is one mystery \nscience still hasn't illuminated. "

        "text": "This is Mabel. Mabel is an aphid, a small insect \nin the same order as cicadas, stink bugs, and bed bugs. All these bugs pierce their prey \nand suck out vital fluids. Aphids’ prey are plants. And what aphids are after \nis buried within the plant, flowing in tubes made from single cells \nstrung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together \nthey form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar \nper liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly \nproducing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” \nwhich generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— \nin the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,\nwhich is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, \nbetween the plant’s cells, until she pierces \none of those sieve tubes. Because the sap \nis under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out \nof the plant. She just opens a valve in her head \nand lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out \nof her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want \nto be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s \nhypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract \nto a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, \nits high sugar content encourages the water in the cells \nto come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water \nto come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through \nthe insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed \nwith an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose \nand converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… \nthis three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, \nleaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar \nthat are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out \nof Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules \nof sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water \nout of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, \ngetting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species \nhave an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, \nand the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, \nall the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, \nthey don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… \nthat are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… \nwith their own clones. So, these female aphids have \ntwo generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves \nat the same time. Scientists call this \ntelescopic development. That means that aphids can make \nmore of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations \nwithin a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight \nevery two hours, making her one of the most prolific \npoopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce \nhundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different \nfrom sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, \nsyrupy liquid. You might already know it \nby a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much \nthey sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply \nof sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly \nfrom the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes \nused to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey \nfrom honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, \nwhich is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, \nharvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea. "

        "text": "Humans have been fascinated\nwith speed for ages. The history of human progress\nis one of ever-increasing velocity, and one of the most important achievements\nin this historical race was the breaking of the sound barrier. Not long after the first\nsuccessful airplane flights, pilots were eager to push\ntheir planes to go faster and faster. But as they did so, increased turbulence and large forces on the plane\nprevented them from accelerating further. Some tried to circumvent\nthe problem through risky dives, often with tragic results. Finally, in 1947, design improvements, such as a movable horizontal stabilizer,\nthe all-moving tail, allowed an American military pilot\nnamed Chuck Yeager to fly the Bell X-1 aircraft at 1127 km/h, becoming the first person\nto break the sound barrier and travel faster than the speed of sound. The Bell X-1 was the first of many\nsupersonic aircraft to follow, with later designs reaching\nspeeds over Mach 3. Aircraft traveling at supersonic speed\ncreate a shock wave with a thunder-like noise\nknown as a sonic boom, which can cause distress to people\nand animals below or even damage buildings. For this reason, scientists around the world\nhave been looking at sonic booms, trying to predict their path\nin the atmosphere, where they will land,\nand how loud they will be. To better understand\nhow scientists study sonic booms, let's start with some basics of sound. Imagine throwing a small stone\nin a still pond. What do you see? The stone causes waves\nto travel in the water at the same speed in every direction. These circles that keep growing in radius\nare called wave fronts. Similarly, even though we cannot see it, a stationary sound source,\nlike a home stereo, creates sound waves traveling outward. The speed of the waves depends on factors like the altitude and temperature\nof the air they move through. At sea level, sound travels\nat about 1225 km/h. But instead of circles\non a two-dimensional surface, the wave fronts\nare now concentric spheres, with the sound traveling along rays\nperpendicular to these waves. Now imagine a moving sound source,\nsuch as a train whistle. As the source keeps moving\nin a certain direction, the successive waves in front of it\nwill become bunched closer together. This greater wave frequency is the cause\nof the famous Doppler effect, where approaching objects\nsound higher pitched. But as long as the source is moving\nslower than the sound waves themselves, they will remain nested within each other. It's when an object goes supersonic,\nmoving faster than the sound it makes, that the picture changes dramatically. As it overtakes sound waves\nit has emitted, while generating new ones from\nits current position, the waves are forced together,\nforming a Mach cone. No sound is heard\nas it approaches an observer because the object is traveling faster\nthan the sound it produces. Only after the object has passed\nwill the observer hear the sonic boom. Where the Mach cone meets the ground,\nit forms a hyperbola, leaving a trail known as the boom carpet\nas it travels forward. This makes it possible to determine\nthe area affected by a sonic boom. What about figuring out how strong\na sonic boom will be? This involves solving the famous\nNavier-Stokes equations to find the variation\nof pressure in the air due to the supersonic aircraft\nflying through it. This results in the pressure signature\nknown as the N-wave. What does this shape mean? Well, the sonic boom occurs\nwhen there is a sudden change in pressure, and the N-wave involves two booms: one for the initial pressure rise\nat the aircraft's nose, and another for when the tail passes, and the pressure suddenly\nreturns to normal. This causes a double boom, but it is usually heard as a single boom\nby human ears. In practice, computer models\nusing these principles can often predict the location\nand intensity of sonic booms for given atmospheric conditions\nand flight trajectories, and there is ongoing research\nto mitigate their effects. In the meantime, supersonic flight\nover land remains prohibited. So, are sonic booms a recent creation? Not exactly. While we try to find ways to silence them, a few other animals have been\nusing sonic booms to their advantage. The gigantic Diplodocus may have been\ncapable of cracking its tail faster than sound, at over 1200 km/h,\npossibly to deter predators. Some types of shrimp can also create\na similar shock wave underwater, stunning or even killing pray\nat a distance with just a snap of their oversized claw. So while we humans\nhave made great progress in our relentless pursuit of speed, it turns out that nature was there first. "

        "text": "It's a hot day, and you've just downed \nseveral glasses of water, one after the other. Behind the sudden urge that follows\nare two bean-shaped organs that work as fine-tuned internal sensors. They balance the amount of fluid\nin your body, detect waste in your blood, and know when to release \nthe vitamins, minerals, and hormones you need to stay alive. Say hello to your kidneys. The main role of these organs\nis to dispose of waste products and to turn them into urine. The body's eight liters of blood\npass through the kidneys between 20 and 25 times each day, meaning that, together, these organs filter\nabout 180 liters every 24 hours. The ingredients in your blood\nare constantly changing as you ingest food and drink, which explains why \nthe kidneys need to be on permanent duty. Blood enters each kidney through arteries\nthat branch and branch, until they form tiny vessels that entwine\nwith special internal modules, called nephrons. In each kidney, 1 million of these nephrons form \na powerful array of filters and sensors that carefully sift through the blood. This is where we see just how refined and accurate this internal \nsensing system is. To filter the blood, each nephron\nuses two powerful pieces of equipment: a blob-like structure called a glomerulus,\nand a long, stringy, straw-like tubule. The glomerulus works like a sieve,\nallowing only certain ingredients, such as vitamins and minerals,\nto pass into the tubule. Then, this vessel's job is to detect whether any of those ingredients \nare needed in the body. If so, they're reabsorbed in amounts\nthat the body needs, so they can circulate in the blood again. But the blood doesn't only \ncarry useful ingredients. It contains waste products, too. And the nephrons have to figure out \nwhat to do with them. The tubules sense compounds \nthe body doesn't need, like urea, left over from \nthe breakdown of proteins, and redirects them as urine \nout of the kidneys and through two long sewers\ncalled ureters. The tubes empty their contents\ninto the bladder to be discharged, ridding your body of that waste\nonce and for all. There's water in that urine, too. If the kidney detects too much of it\nin your blood, for instance, when you've chugged\nseveral glasses at once, it sends the extra liquid\nto the bladder to be removed. On the other hand,\nlow water levels in the blood prompt the kidney to release some\nback into the blood stream, meaning that less water \nmakes it into the urine. This is why urine appears yellower\nwhen you're less hydrated. By controlling water, your kidneys\nstabilize the body's fluid levels. But this fine balancing act\nisn't the kidney's only skill. These organs have the power \nto activate vitamin D to secrete a hormone called renin\nthat raises blood pressure, and another hormone \ncalled erythropoietin, which increases red blood cell production. Without the kidneys, our bodily fluids \nwould spiral out of control. Every time we ate, our blood would receive\nanother load of unsifted ingredients. Soon, the buildup of waste would overload\nour systems and we'd expire. So each kidney not only \nkeeps things running smoothly. It also keeps us alive. Lucky then that we have two \nof these magical beans. "

        "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IjiKUmfaZr4/hqdefault.jpg",
        "text": "What's that sound? Depending on whom you ask, the crackle of popping joints\nis either the sound of sweet relief or the noxious tones \nof a stomach-turning habit. Really, though. What's that sound? I mean, why does bending your joints\nin a certain way make them pop like that? Scientists have offered \nseveral explanations, including rapidly stretching ligaments, and in severe cases, actual bones \ngrinding against each other. But the most common explanation for why your stretched-out joints\nsound like bubbles popping is that, well, there are bubbles in there. The joints in your fingers \nare the easiest ones to crack, but many people also crack the joints\nbetween vertebrae in their neck and back, and even their hips, wrists, \nshoulders and so on. All these joints are synovial joints, and they're the most flexible \nones in your body. The space between the two bones\nis filled with a viscous liquid, synovial fluid, which contains long,\nlubricating molecules, like hyaluronic acid and lubricin. Synovial fluid is more or less\nthe texture of egg yolk and its primary purpose \nis to cushion the bones and help them glide past each other. It also contains phagocytic cells that help clean up any bone or cartilage\ndebris that ends up in the joint. But the reason it's important \nfor knuckle cracking is that, like other fluids in your body, it contains lots of dissolved \ngas molecules. Knuckle-crackers know that \nto get that satisfying pop, you stretch the joint farther\nthan it normally goes by bending your fingers \nbackwards, for example. When you do that, \nthe bones move away from each other. The space between bones gets bigger, but the amount of synovial fluid \nstays constant. That creates a low-pressure zone that pulls dissolved gases \nout of the synovial fluid, just like the carbon dioxide \nthat fizzes out of soda when you twist open the cap. Inside the joint, the escaping gases \nform a bubble with a pop. But the bubble doesn't last long. The surrounding fluid presses on it\nuntil it finally collapses. The bubble's gases scatter \nthroughout the synovial cavity and slowly dissolve back into the fluid\nover the course of about twenty minutes, which is why it can take a while\nbefore you can pop the same joint again. Some scientists think \nthere may actually be two pops. One when the bubble forms, \nand another when it bursts. Popping a joint temporarily enlarges it, which may be why dedicated \nknuckle-, neck- and back-crackers say the habit makes their joints\nfeel looser and more flexible. But you may have heard from \na concerned relative or annoyed officemate that cracking your joints \nwill give you arthritis. A doctor named \nDonald Unger heard this, too. So, determined to disprove \nhis mother's warnings, he cracked the knuckles \nof his left hand repeatedly for 50 years, while the right-hand \nknuckles went unpopped. 36,500 cracks later, \nboth hands were arthritis-free. For this selfless act \nof devotion to science, Dr. Unger received an Ig Nobel Prize, a parody of the Nobel Prize\nthat recognizes wacky, but weirdly fascinating,\nscientific accomplishments. Unger wrote that his results should prompt\ninvestigation into other parental beliefs, like the importance of eating spinach. The jury's still out on that one. As for knuckle-cracking, one study suggests \nthat all that joint stretching and bubble bursting\ncan cause your hands to swell and weaken your grip. But the biggest proven danger\nseems to be annoying those around you. "

But you’ve recently received awful news: three unrelated people in one city died\nafter eating your burgers. The police concluded that a criminal \ntargeted your brand, injecting poison into your product \nin at least two grocery stores. The culprit used an ultrafine instrument \nthat left no trace on the packaging, making it impossible to determine \nwhich products were compromised. Your burgers were immediately\nremoved from the two stores where the victims bought them. The deaths are headline news, the killer is still at large, \nand sales have plummeted. You must quickly develop a strategy \nto deal with the crisis. Your team comes up with three options: 1. Do nothing. 2. Pull the products from grocery stores \ncitywide and destroy them. Or 3. Pull and destroy \nthe product worldwide. Which do you choose? Your company lawyer explains \nthat a recall is not required by law because the criminal is fully responsible. She recommends the first option— \ndoing nothing— because recalling the product \ncould look like an admission of fault. But is that the most ethical strategy? To gauge the ethicality of each choice, you could perform \na “stakeholder analysis.” This would allow you to weigh \nthe interests of some key stakeholders— investors, employees, and customers—\nagainst one another. With the first option your advisors project that the crisis \nwill eventually blow over. Sales will then improve but probably \nstay below prior levels because of damage to the brand. As a result, you’ll have to lay off \nsome employees, and investors will suffer minor losses. But more customers could die \nif the killer poisoned packages elsewhere. The second option is expensive\nin the short-term and will require greater employee layoffs and additional financial loss \nto investors. But this option is safer \nfor customers in the city and could create enough trust \nthat sales will eventually rebound. The third option is the most expensive \nin the short-term and will require significant \nemployee layoffs and investor losses. Though you have no evidence that these\ncrimes are an international threat, this option provides the greatest\ncustomer protection. Given the conflict between the interests\nof your customers versus those of your investors \nand employees, which strategy is the most ethical? To make this decision, \nyou could consider these tests: First is the Utilitarian Test: Utilitarianism is a philosophy concerned with maximizing the greatest amount \nof good for the greatest number of people. What would be the impact of each\noption on these terms? Second is the Family Test: How would you feel\nexplaining your decision to your family? Third is the Newspaper Test: how would you feel reading about it \non the front page of the local newspaper? And finally, you could use \nthe Mentor Test: If someone you admire were making \nthis decision, what would they do? Johnson & Johnson CEO James Burke \nfaced a similar challenge in 1982 after a criminal added the poison cyanide\nto bottles of Tylenol in Chicago. Seven people died and sales dropped. Industry analysts said \nthe company was done for. In response, Burke decided to pull Tylenol\nfrom all shelves worldwide, citing customer safety \nas the company’s highest priority. Johnson & Johnson recalled and destroyed\nan estimated 32 million bottles of Tylenol valued at 250 million in today’s dollars. 1.5 million of the recalled bottles \nwere tested and 3 of them— all from the Chicago area— were found to contain cyanide. Burke’s decision helped the company \nregain the trust of its customers, and product sales rebounded within a year. Prompted by the Tylenol murders, \nJohnson & Johnson became a leader in developing tamper-resistant packaging and the government instituted \nstricter regulations. The killer, meanwhile, was never caught. Burke’s decision prevented further deaths\nfrom the initial poisoning, but the federal government investigated\nhundreds of copycat tampering incidents involving other products \nin the following weeks. Could these have been prevented \nwith a different response? Was Burke acting in the interest \nof the public or of his company? Was this good ethics or good marketing? As with all ethical dilemmas, \nthis has no clear right or wrong answer. And for your meatless burger empire,\nthe choice remains yours. "

In the 1800s, captains \nfrom New Orleans and New England ventured to the Caribbean in search \nof coconuts and other goods. They began to experiment with bananas,\npurchasing one kind, called Gros Michel, from Afro-Caribbean\nfarmers in Jamaica, Cuba, and Honduras. Gros Michel bananas produced large bunches\nof relatively thick-skinned fruit— ideal for shipping. By the end of the 1800s, \nbananas were a hit in the US. They were affordable, \navailable year-round, and endorsed by medical doctors. As bananas became big business, U.S. fruit companies wanted \nto grow their own bananas. In order to secure access to land, banana moguls lobbied and bribed\ngovernment officials in Central America, and even funded coups to ensure \nthey had allies in power. In Honduras, Manuel Bonilla repaid \nthe banana man who had financed his return to power\nwith land concessions. By the 1930s, one company dominated\nthe region: United Fruit, who owned over 40% of Guatemala’s \narable land at one point. They cleared rainforest in Costa Rica,\nColombia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama to build plantations, along with railroads, ports, \nand towns to house workers. Lured by relatively high-paying jobs,\npeople migrated to banana zones. From Guatemala to Colombia, United Fruit’s plantations grew\nexclusively Gros Michel bananas. These densely packed farms \nhad little biological diversity, making them ripe for disease epidemics. The infrastructure connecting \nthese vulnerable farms could quickly spread disease: pathogens could hitch a ride from one\nfarm to another on workers’ boots, railroad cars, and steamships. That’s exactly what happened in the 1910s, when a fungus began to level \nGros Michel banana plantations, first in Panama, and later throughout\nCentral America, spreading quickly via the same system that\nhad enabled big profits and cheap bananas. In a race against “Panama Disease,” banana companies abandoned \ninfected plantations in Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala, leaving thousands of farmers and workers \njobless. The companies then felled \nextensive tracts of rainforests in order to establish new plantations. After World War II, the dictatorships with which United Fruit\nhad partnered in Guatemala and Honduras yielded to democratically elected\ngovernments that called for land reform. In Guatemala, President Jacobo Arbenz\ntried to buy back land from United Fruit and redistribute it to landless farmers. The Arbenz government offered to pay\na price based on tax records— where United Fruit had underreported\nthe value of the land. El Pulpo was not happy. The company launched propaganda\ncampaigns against Arbenz and called on its deep connections \nin the US Government for help. Citing fears of communism,\nthe CIA orchestrated the overthrow of the democratically elected \nArbenz in 1954. That same year in Honduras, thousands\nof United Fruit workers went on strike until the company agreed to recognize\na new labor union. With the political and economic costs \nof running from Panama Disease escalating, United Fruit finally switched \nfrom Gros Michel to Panama disease-resistant Cavendish\nbananas in the early 1960s. Today, bananas are no longer \nas economically vital in Central America, and United Fruit Company, \nrechristened Chiquita, has lost its stranglehold\non Latin American politics. But the modern banana industry\nisn’t without problems. Cavendish bananas require frequent\napplications of pesticides that create hazards for farmworkers \nand ecosystems. And though they’re resistant \nto the particular pathogen that affected Gros Michel bananas, Cavendish farms \nalso lack biological diversity, leaving the banana trade \nripe for another pandemic. "

        "text": "It may seem like the semicolon\nis struggling with an identity crisis. It looks like a comma \ncrossed with a period. Maybe that's why we toss these punctuation\nmarks around like grammatical confetti. We're confused about \nhow to use them properly. In fact, it's the semicolon's half-half \nstatus that makes it useful. It's stronger than a comma,\nand less final than a period. It fills the spaces in between,\nand for that reason, it has some specific\nand important tasks. For one, it can clarify \nideas in a sentence that's already festooned with commas. \"Semicolons: At first, they may \nseem frightening, then, they become enlightening, finally, you'll find yourself falling\nfor these delightful punctuation marks.\" Even though the commas separate \ndifferent parts of the sentence, it's easy to lose track \nof what belongs where. But then the semicolon \nedges in to the rescue. In list-like sentences, it can exert\nmore force than commas do, cutting sentences into compartments\nand grouping items that belong together. The semicolon breaks things up,\nbut it also builds connections. Another of its tasks is to link together\nindependent clauses. These are sentences \nthat can stand on their own, but when connected by semicolons, look and sound better\nbecause they're related in some way. \"Semicolons were once \na great mystery to me. I had no idea where to put them.\" Technically, there's nothing \nwrong with that. These two sentences can stand alone. But imagine they appeared\nin a long list of other sentences, all of the same length,\neach separated by periods. Things would get monotonous very fast. In that situation, semicolons bring fluidity \nand variation to writing by connecting related clauses. But as beneficial as they are,\nsemicolons don't belong just anywhere. There are two main rules \nthat govern their use. Firstly, unless they're \nbeing used in lists, semicolons should only connect clauses\nthat are related in some way. You wouldn't use one here, for instance: \"Semicolons were once \na great mystery to me; I'd really like a sandwich.\" Periods work best here because these\nare two totally different ideas. A semicolon's job is to reunite \ntwo independent clauses that will benefit from \none another's company because they refer to the same thing. Secondly, you'll almost never find\na semicolon willingly stationed before coordinating conjunctions: the words, \"and,\" \"but,\" \"for,\"\n\"nor,\" \"or,\" \"so,\" and \"yet.\" That's a comma's place, in fact. But a semicolon can replace \na conjunction to shorten a sentence or to give it some variety. Ultimately, this underappreciated\npunctuation mark can give writing clarity, \nforce, and style, all encompassed \nin one tiny dot and squiggle that's just waiting to be put \nin the right place. "

        "text": "You're in line at the grocery store when, uh oh, someone sneezes on you. The cold virus is sucked inside your lungs and lands on a cell on your airway lining. Every living thing on Earth is made of cells, from the smallest one-celled bacteria to the giant blue whale to you. Each cell in your body is surrounded by a cell membrane, a thick flexible layer made of fats and proteins, that surrounds and protects the inner components. It's semipermeable, meaning that it lets some thing pass in and out but blocks others. The cell membrane is covered with tiny projections. They all have functions, like helping cells adhere to their neighbors or binding to nutrients the cell will need. Animal and plant cells have cell membranes. Only plant cells have a cell wall, which is made of rigid cellulose that gives the plant structure. The virus cell that was sneezed into your lungs is sneaky. Pretending to be a friend, it attaches to a projection on the cell membrane, and the cell brings it through the cell membrane and inside. When the virus gets through, the cell recognizes its mistake. An enemy is inside! Special enzymes arrive at the scene and chop the virus to pieces. They then send one of the pieces back through the cell membrane, where the cell displays it to warn neighboring cells about the invader. A nearby cell sees the warning and immediately goes into action. It needs to make antibodies, proteins that will attack and kill the invading virus. This process starts in the nucleus. The nucleus contains our DNA, the blueprint that tells our cells how to make everything our bodies need to function. A certain section of our DNA contains instructions that tell our cells how to make antibodies. Enzymes in the nucleus find the right section of DNA, then create a copy of these instructions, called messenger RNA. The messenger RNA leaves the nucleus to carry out its orders. The messenger RNA travels to a ribosome. There can be as many as 10 million ribosomes in a human cell, all studded along a ribbon-like structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. This ribosome reads the instructions from the nucleus. It takes amino acids and links them together one by one creating an antibody protein that will go fight the virus. But before it can do that, the antibody needs to leave the cell. The antibody heads to the golgi apparatus. Here, it's packed up for delivery outside the cell. Enclosed in a bubble made of the same material as the cell membrane, the golgi apparatus also gives the antibody directions, telling it how to get to the edge of the cell. When it gets there, the bubble surrounding the antibody fuses to the cell membrane. The cell ejects the antibody, and it heads out to track down the virus. The leftover bubble will be broken down by the cell's lysosomes and its pieces recycled over and over again. Where did the cell get the energy to do all this? That's the roll of the mitochondria. To make energy, the mitochondria takes oxygen, this is the only reason we breathe it, and adds electrons from the food we eat to make water molecules. That process also creates a high energy molecule, called ATP which the cell uses to power all of its parts. Plant cells make energy a different way. They have chloroplasts that combine carbon dioxide and water with light energy from the sun to create oxygen and sugar, a form of chemical energy. All the parts of a cell have to work together to keep things running smoothly, and all the cells of your body have to work together to keep you running smoothly. That's a whole lot of cells. Scientists think there are about 37 trillion of them. "

        "text": "When we hear the word radiation, it's tempting to picture huge explosions\nand frightening mutations, but that's not the full story. Radiation also applies to rainbows and a doctor examining an x-ray. So what is radiation really, and how much should we worry\nabout its effects? The answer begins with understanding\nthat the word radiation describes two very different \nscientific phenomena: electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical\nand magnetic waves oscillating through space. As these waves oscillate faster, they scale up in energy. At the lower end of the spectrum,\nthere's radio, infrared, and visible light. At the higher end are ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays. Modern society is shaped by sending\nand detecting electromagnetic radiation. We might download an email to our phone\nvia radio waves to open an image of an X-ray print, which we can see because our screen\nemits visible light. Nuclear radiation, on the other hand, originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other\ndue to their mutually positive charges. A phenomenon known as\nthe strong nuclear force struggles to overcome this repulsion and keep the nucleus intact. However, some combinations\nof protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain unstable, or radioactive. They will randomly eject matter\nand/or energy, known as nuclear radiation, to achieve greater stability. Nuclear radiation comes from natural\nsources, like radon, a gas which seeps up from the ground. We also refine naturally occurring\nradioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants. Even bananas contain trace amounts\nof a radioactive potassium isotope. So if we live in a world of radiation, how can we escape its dangerous effects? To start, not all radiation is hazardous. Radiation becomes risky when it rips\natoms' electrons away upon impact, a process that can damage DNA. This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost\nor gained electrons is called an ion. All nuclear radiation is ionizing, while only the highest energy \nelectromagnetic radiation is. That includes gamma rays, X-rays, and the high-energy end of ultraviolet. That's why as an extra precaution\nduring X-rays, doctors shield body parts \nthey don't need to examine, and why beach-goers use sunscreen. In comparison, cell phones and microwaves\noperate at the lower end of the spectrum, so there is no risk of ionizing radiation\nfrom their use. The biggest health risk occurs\nwhen lots of ionizing radiation hits us in a short time period, also known as an acute exposure. Acute exposures overwhelm the body's\nnatural ability to repair the damage. This can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death. Fortunately, acute exposures are rare, but we are exposed daily to lower levels\nof ionizing radiation from both natural and man-made sources. Scientists have a harder time quantifying\nthese risks. Your body often repairs damage\nfrom small amounts ionizing radiation, and if it can't, the results of damage may not manifest\nfor a decade or more. One way scientists compare ionizing\nradiation exposure is a unit called the sievert. An acute exposure to one sievert\nwill probably cause nausea within hours, and four sieverts could be fatal. However, our normal daily exposures\nare far lower. The average person receives \n6.2 millisieverts of radiation from all sources annually, around a third due to radon. At only five microsieverts each, you'd need to get more \nthan 1200 dental X-rays to rack up your annual dosage. And remember that banana? If you could absorb \nall the banana's radiation, you'd need around 170 a day\nto hit your annual dosage. We live in a world of radiation. However, much of that radiation\nis non-ionizing. For the remainder that is ionizing, our exposures are usually low, and choices like getting your home\ntested for radon and wearing sunscreen can help reduce \nthe associated health risks. Marie Curie, \none of the early radiation pioneers, summed up the challenge as follows: \"Nothing in life is to be feared,\nit is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more,\nso that we may fear less.\" "

        "text": "When we talk about English,\nwe often think of it as a single language but what do the dialects spoken\nin dozens of countries around the world have in common with each other, or with the writings of Chaucer? And how are any of them related\nto the strange words in Beowulf? The answer is that like most languages, English has evolved \nthrough generations of speakers, undergoing major changes over time. By undoing these changes, we can trace the language \nfrom the present day back to its ancient roots. While modern English \nshares many similar words with Latin-derived romance languages, like French and Spanish, most of those words \nwere not originally part of it. Instead, they started coming \ninto the language with the Norman invasion \nof England in 1066. When the French-speaking Normans\nconquered England and became its ruling class, they brought their speech with them, adding a massive amount \nof French and Latin vocabulary to the English language \npreviously spoken there. Today, we call that language Old English. This is the language of Beowulf. It probably doesn't look very familiar, but it might be more recognizable\nif you know some German. That's because Old English\nbelongs to the Germanic language family, first brought to the British Isles\nin the 5th and 6th centuries by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. The Germanic dialects they spoke would\nbecome known as Anglo-Saxon. Viking invaders in the 8th \nto 11th centuries added more borrowings \nfrom Old Norse into the mix. It may be hard to see the roots\nof modern English underneath all the words borrowed from French, Latin, Old Norse \nand other languages. But comparative linguistics can help us\nby focusing on grammatical structure, patterns of sound changes, and certain core vocabulary. For example, after the 6th century, German words starting with \"p,\"\nsystematically shifted to a \"pf\" sound while their Old English counterparts\nkept the \"p\" unchanged. In another split, words \nthat have \"sk\" sounds in Swedish developed an \"sh\" sound in English. There are still some English \nwords with \"sk,\" like \"skirt,\" and \"skull,\" but they're direct borrowings \nfrom Old Norse that came after the \"sk\" to \"sh\" shift. These examples show us that just as the various Romance languages\ndescended from Latin, English, Swedish, German, \nand many other languages descended from their own common ancestor\nknown as Proto-Germanic spoken around 500 B.C.E. Because this historical language\nwas never written down, we can only reconstruct it \nby comparing its descendants, which is possible thanks \nto the consistency of the changes. We can even use the same process\nto go back one step further, and trace the origins of Proto-Germanic\nto a language called Proto-Indo-European, spoken about 6000 years ago on the Pontic steppe \nin modern day Ukraine and Russia. This is the reconstructed ancestor\nof the Indo-European family that includes nearly all languages\nhistorically spoken in Europe, as well as large parts of Southern\nand Western Asia. And though it requires a bit more work, we can find the same systematic \nsimilarities, or correspondences, between related words in different\nIndo-European branches. Comparing English with Latin, we see that English has \"t\" \nwhere Latin has \"d\", and \"f\" where latin has \"p\"\nat the start of words. Some of English's more distant relatives\ninclude Hindi, Persian and the Celtic languages it displaced\nin what is now Britain. Proto-Indo-European itself descended\nfrom an even more ancient language, but unfortunately, this is as far back\nas historical and archeological evidence will allow us to go. Many mysteries remain just out of reach, such as whether there might be a link\nbetween Indo-European and other major language families, and the nature of the languages spoken\nin Europe prior to its arrival. But the amazing fact remains that nearly\n3 billion people around the world, many of whom cannot understand each other, are nevertheless speaking the same words\nshaped by 6000 years of history. "

        "text": "And the clock starts... now. Did you miss it? It wasn’t some bug buzzing by \nor a weird trick of the light. You just saw a hummingbird perform\nastonishing aerial acrobatics, eat lunch in midair, pollinate a flower,\nand then escape a threat upside down— all in a matter of seconds. So let’s slow down the action, and unpack\neach step in this blazing-fast feast. First up, their incredibly rapid flight. Hummingbirds typically beat their wings \n30 to 40 times per second, creating the high-frequency hum \nthey’re named for. To flap their wings at this speed, hummingbirds have evolved \ngiant pectoral muscles that comprise over a third \nof some species’ bodyweight. But the real secret to their fine-tuned\nflight is all in the wrist. Most birds only generate lift \non the downstroke of each flap, while using the upward recovery stroke \nto set up their next wing beat. Hummingbirds however, \nturn their wrists during the upstroke, changing their wing’s angle to flap \nin a figure 8 pattern that continually generates lift \nthroughout their wingbeats. Alongside their massive muscles,\nthis special lift-producing technique allows hummingbirds to achieve \nsustained hovering flight— an aerial feat no other bird can perform. Hovering lets hummingbirds slow \nto a stop almost instantly and assess scenarios in midair. Then, they can take off in any direction, reaching speeds faster than a fighter jet,\nrelative to the bird’s size. And since they can beat each of their\nwings at different speeds and angles, the birds can perform \nincredible spins and turns all while flying backwards \nor even upside down. Of course, flying this way \ncan be exhausting. Hovering is one of the most energy\nintensive forms of movement in the animal kingdom. And relative to their body size, hummingbirds have the highest \nmetabolic rates of all vertebrates. This leads them to eat very frequently— often consuming an average \nof four meals an hour while flying. Fortunately, their hovering lets them eat\nat remarkable angles without perching, consuming food that would otherwise\nbe impossible to reach. Using their long slender bills, they reach deep inside flowers \nand pump out nectar with their thin grooved tongues. This sugary liquid is a hummingbird’s\nmost important energy source, and a single bird consumes six times \nits weight in nectar every day over hundreds of small meals. Each of these sugary snacks also \npollinates the flower being visited with pollen left on the bird \nfrom previous meals. That's just a rough idea of what\nhummingbirds can do in several seconds. But if we hang around a little longer, we might see their aerial acrobatics\nput to a more dangerous test. Hummingbirds keep track of which flowers\nthey've recently drained, as well as those they plan to drain next. And each bird will fight ruthlessly \nto defend this floral territory from their only real competition: \nother hummingbirds. Using their spear-like bills \nand blindingly fast flight, dueling hummingbirds chase each other \nthrough the air, aggressively stabbing \nand plucking feathers. The bills of some species are specialized\nfor fighting, with spiny tips, hooks, \nor even saw-like serrations. Some hummingbirds employ \nthese aerial fencing techniques to chase off larger birds \nlike hawks and owls. But the most extreme fights are between\nmale hummingbirds competing for flowers and females. Fortunately, these duels \nare rarely deadly. After 15 to 20 seconds, one bird\nwill typically surrender— flying off to seek its breakfast \nelsewhere. After all this fighting, feeding, \nand flying, hummingbirds sometimes need \nto sleep off the day’s events in a mild form of hibernation \ncalled torpor. Their hearts— proportionally \nthe largest in the animal kingdom— slow from 1,200 beats per minute \nto a mere 50. But when they wake up 4 to 7 hours later, their lightning-fast metabolism \nkicks back into gear. With all this speed and strength, it’s no wonder the Aztecs revered \nthese energetic birds as agents of the god of war \nHuitzilopotchli— a reminder that immense power \ncan come in the smallest packages.

Countless poets and writers \nhave tried to put words to the experience of a panic attack— a sensation so overwhelming, many people \nmistake it for a heart attack, stroke, or other life-threatening crisis. Though panic attacks don’t cause \nlong-term physical harm, afterwards, the fear of another attack \ncan limit someone’s daily life— and cause more panic attacks. Studies suggest that almost a third of us will experience at least one \npanic attack in our lives. And whether it’s your first, \nyour hundredth, or you’re witnessing someone else \ngo through one, no one wants to repeat the experience. Even learning about them can \nbe uncomfortable, but it’s necessary— because the first step to preventing \npanic attacks is understanding them. At its core, a panic attack \nis an overreaction to the body’s normal physiological response \nto the perception of danger. This response starts with the amygdala, the brain region involved \nin processing fear. When the amygdala perceives danger, it stimulates \nthe sympathetic nervous system, which triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline prompts an increase \nin the heart and breathing rate to get blood and oxygen \nto the muscles of the arms and legs. This also sends oxygen to the brain, \nmaking it more alert and responsive. During a panic attack, this response is exaggerated \nwell past what would be useful in a dangerous situation, causing a racing heart, heavy breathing, \nor hyperventilation. The changes to blood flow \ncause lightheadedness and numbness in the hands and feet. A panic attack usually peaks \nwithin 10 minutes. Then, the prefrontal cortex \ntakes over from the amygdala and stimulates \nthe parasympathetic nervous system. This triggers the release of a hormone \ncalled acetylcholine that decreases the heart rate \nand gradually winds down the panic attack. In a panic attack, the body’s \nperception of danger is enough to trigger the response we would\nhave to a real threat— and then some. We don't know for sure \nwhy this happens, but sometimes cues in the environment \nthat remind us of traumatic past experience \ncan trigger a panic attack. Panic attacks can be part \nof anxiety disorders like PTSD, social anxiety disorder, OCD, \nand generalized anxiety disorder. Recurring panic attacks, \nfrequent worry about new attacks, and behavioral changes \nto avoid panic attacks can lead to a diagnosis \nof a panic disorder. The two main treatments \nfor panic disorder are antidepressant medication \nand cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. Both have about a 40% response rate— though someone who responds to one \nmay not respond to the other. However, antidepressant medications \ncarry some side effects, and 50% of people relapse \nwhen they stop taking them. CBT, meanwhile, is more lasting, \nwith only a 20% relapse rate. The goal of CBT treatment for panic \ndisorder is to help people learn and practice concrete tools \nto exert physical, and in turn mental, control over the sensations and thoughts \nassociated with a panic attack. CBT begins with an explanation of the \nphysiological causes of a panic attack, followed by breath and muscle exercises \ndesigned to help people consciously control breathing patterns. Next comes cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying \nand changing the thoughts that are common during attacks— such as believing you’ll stop breathing, \nhave a heart attack, or die— and replacing them \nwith more accurate thoughts. The next stage of treatment is exposure \nto the bodily sensations and situations that typically trigger a panic attack. The goal is to change the belief, \nthrough experience, that these sensations and situations \nare dangerous. Even after CBT, taking these steps \nisn’t easy in the grip of an attack. But with practice, these tools \ncan both prevent and de-escalate attacks, and ultimately reduce the hold of panic \non a person’s life. Outside formal therapy, many panickers find relief from the same \nbeliefs CBT aims to instill: that fear can’t hurt you, \nbut holding on to it will escalate panic. Even if you’ve never had a panic attack, understanding them will help you identify \none in yourself or someone else— and recognizing them is the first step \nin preventing them. "

        "text": "It starts with a cough, or a wheeze. Soon, your chest feels tight. Your breathing speeds up\nand gets shallower, making you feel short of breath. These are common symptoms\nof an asthma attack. Around the world, more than 300 million\npeople suffer from asthma, and around 250,000 people \ndie from it each year. But why do people get asthma\nand how can this disease be deadly? Asthma affects the respiratory system, particularly the smaller airways, such as the bronchi and bronchioles. These airways have an inner lining\ncalled the mucosa that's surrounded \nby a layer of smooth muscle. In people with asthma, the airways\nare chronically inflamed, which can make them hyper-responsive\nto certain triggers. Some of the many asthma triggers\ninclude tobacco smoke, pollen, dust, fragrances, exercise, cold weather, stress, and even the common cold. When people with asthma are exposed\nto these triggers, an asthma attack, or exacerbation,\ncan occur. But how exactly do such everyday factors\nlead to an asthma attack? If an asthmatic is exposed to a trigger, the smooth rings of muscle that circle\nthe small airways in their lungs contract and become narrow. Simultaneously, the trigger\nworsens inflammation, causing the mucosal lining\nto become more swollen and secrete more mucus. Under normal conditions, the body uses this mucus to trap\nand clear particles, like pollen or dust, but during an asthma attack, it blocks the narrowed airways,\nmaking it even harder to breathe. These effects lead \nto this symptoms of asthma. Smooth muscle constriction results\nin the feeling of chest tightness. Excess mucus and increased inflammation\ncan cause coughing. And the wheezing noise? That happens because \nas the airways constrict, air whistles as it passes through\nthe narrowed space. These symptoms may make a person\nfeel like they're running out of air. Yet counterintuitively, \nduring an asthma attack, the inflammation can make it harder\nto exhale than inhale. Over time, this leads to an excess\nof air in the lungs, a phenomenon known as hyperinflation. The trapping of air inside the lungs\nforces the body to work harder to move air in and out of them. Over time, this can lead to reduced oxygen\ndelivery to the body's organs and tissues. Sometimes, in untreated \nsevere asthma attacks, the body can't keep up, which can lead to death from\nlack of oxygen. So how do we prevent these uncomfortable\nand potentially fatal attacks in people who have asthma? One way is to reduce the presence\nof triggers. Unfortunately, the world \nis an unpredictable place and exposure to triggers can't\nalways be controlled. This is where inhalers, the primary\ntreatment for asthma, come in. These medications help asthmatics both\ncontrol and prevent their asthma symptoms. Inhalers transport medication along\nthe affected airways using a liquid mist or fine powder\nto treat the problem at its source. They come in two forms. There are reliever medications, which treat symptoms immediately\nand contain beta-agonists. Beta-agonists relax constricted muslces, allowing the airways to widen so more air\ncan travel into and out of the lungs. The other form of inhalers serve\nas preventive medications, which treat asthma symptoms\nover the long term, and contain corticosteroids. Corticosteroids reduce airway sensitivity\nand inflammation, so asthma can be kept under control. They're also crucial in preventing\nlong-term damage from chronic inflammation, which can cause scarring of the airways. Inhalers are known to be very effective, and have helped many people\nlive better lives. Although we've come a long way\nin improving how we treat and diagnose asthma, we still don't know its exact causes. We currently believe that a combination\nof genetic and environmental factors play a role, potentially acting during early childhood. Recent research has even linked\npoverty to asthma incidents. This may be due to reasons ranging from exposure to additional pollutants\nand environmental irritants to difficulties in obtaining medical care\nor treatment. As our understanding of asthma improves, we can continue to find better ways to\nkeep people's airways happy and healthy. "

        "text": "The year is 15 CE\nand the Roman Empire is prospering. Most of the credit will go to the emperor, but this success wouldn’t \nhave been possible without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix. Servius enlisted as a legionary \neight years ago at age 18, the son of a poor farmer\nwith few prospects. Unlike the majority of legionaries,\nhe doesn’t gamble, so he’s been able to save \nmost of his wages. He’s even kept his viaticum, the three gold coins he received \nwhen he enlisted. If he survives until retirement, \nhe’ll receive several acres of land. And he’s grown rather fond \nof a girl back home whom he intends to marry. But he’ll have to wait until he completes \nhis 25 years of service before that can happen. And the life of a legionary \nis dangerous and grueling. Today, Servius’s legion, \nalong with three others, has undertaken a “great march” \nof 30,000 Roman paces, the equivalent of nearly 36 kilometers. Servius’s armor and weapons, including his gladius, scutum, and two pila, weigh over 20 kilograms. And that’s not counting his backpack, \nor sarcina, which contains food and all the tools\nhe needs to help build the camp – spade, saw, pickaxe, and basket. Although Servius is exhausted, \nhe won’t sleep much tonight. He’s been assigned the first watch, which means looking after \nthe baggage animals and keeping alert\nagainst a possible ambush. After he’s done, he lies awake, \ndreading the day ahead, which will force him \nto recall his worst nightmare. At dawn, Servius eats breakfast \nwith his seven tent companions. They’re like a family, all bearing scars \nfrom the battles they’ve fought together. Servius is from Italia, but his fellow soldiers hail \nfrom all over the empire, which stretches from Syria to Spain. So they’re all far from home \nin the northern land of Germania. Servius’s legion \nand three others with him today are under the command of\nEmperor Tiberius’s nephew Germanicus, named for his father’s military successes\nagainst the Germanic tribes. Each legion has close to 5,000 men, divided into cohorts of about 500, further subdivided into centuries \nof around 80-100 men. Each century is commanded by a centurion. An aquilifer, or eagle-bearer, marches at\nthe head of each legion carrying its eagle standard. The centurions march beside \nthe legionaries belting out orders, “Dex, sin, dex, sin,\" “Right, left, right, left,\" starting with the right foot as the left \nis considered unlucky or sinister. Despite the strict discipline, \nthere’s tension in the air. Last year, some legions \nin the area revolted, demanding better pay \nand a cut in the length of service. Only their general’s charisma\nand negotiating skills prevented wholesale mutiny. Today is a “just march,” \nonly 30 kilometers. As the marshes and forests of Germania \nlie beyond the empire’s road system the men must build causeways\nand bridges to make headway— something they’ve recently spent \nmore time doing than fighting. Finally, they arrive at their destination,\na place Servius knows too well. It’s a clearing on the outskirts \nof the Teutoburg Forest, where six years ago, during the\nreign of the Emperor Augustus, Germanic tribes under \ntheir chieftain Arminius ambushed and destroyed three legions. Proceeding along a narrow path, the legions were attacked from \nforest cover under torrential rain with their escape blocked. It was one of the worst defeats \nthe Romans ever suffered and Augustus never lived it down. Servius was one of the few survivors. Servius still has nightmares of \nhis comrades lying where they fell. But now the army is back to bury \nthe dead with full military honors. As he helps in the task, he can’t help wondering whether the bones\nhe handles belonged to someone he knew. Several times he wants to weep aloud, \nbut he pushes on with the task. The glory of the Empire \ncan go to the crows. All he craves is to retire \non a small farm with his wife-to-be, if the gods should spare his life \nfor 17 more years. "

        "text": "It’s the morning of June 12th, 1944 and a pigeon named Paddy is making\nan epic 368 kilometer journey. He manages to dodge Nazi falcons\nthen beats on through stormy weather, flying an average of 79 kilometers\nper hour for almost five hours straight. Paddy’s carrying the first news \nof the D-Day invasion back to England. He wins a medal for gallantry\nfor this accomplishment. Paddy was one of around 250,000 pigeons used by the British during World War II\nto speedily transport secret messages. In fact, pigeon delivery systems\nare ancient human practices. Seeing their meat as a protein source and their nitrogen-rich poop \nas the perfect fertilizer, humans brought pigeons into captivity\nas far back as 10,000 years ago. We then tapped into other traits. Pigeons are naturally speedy \nand possess a powerful homing instinct that drives them to navigate\nlong distances back to the location they consider “home.” So we began developing pigeon posts\nand breeding and training them for racing. In a hobby called \n“pigeon fancying,” people selected for traits \nlike head plumage and fabulously feathered feet. As we carried pigeons around the world,\nthey escaped or were released, forming the wild urban flocks\nwe're familiar with today. Pigeons are now one of the most abundant,\nwidespread species on the planet, managing to thrive in chaotic cities. They owe their success to an ideal\ncombination of traits, including some that were\naccentuated by humans. Unlike birds that nest \non the ground or in trees, pigeons were originally cliff-dwellers. City buildings mimic \ntheir natural habitat. And pigeons set a notoriously \nlow bar when it comes to homemaking. Add some sticks to any window ledge\nor highway overpass and it's a great spot to raise babies. This unfussiness allows them to live \nin environments where more specialized species can’t. As generalists, pigeons take advantage \nof urban food waste. With an organ in their throats \ncalled a crop, they can gorge themselves when food is\navailable and store some for later. They provide “crop milk” to their young\ninstead of having to fetch them live food. Chicks grow quickly with this \nfat and protein-rich meal. If conditions are right,\npigeons breed year-round and produce new offspring every six weeks. They actually have higher breeding rates\nin cities because of the abundance \nof food and shelter. These booming populations \nattract predators. New York City is home \nto a million pigeons, which support large populations\nof raptors. But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight, further exploited by being bred\nfor racing, means they’re made \nfor high speed chases. Compared to barn owls,\nwhich are a similar size, pigeon wing bones are thicker \nand more curved, providing extra space for muscle mass. They can reach speeds \nof 125 kilometers per hour. And their large flocks ensure safety\nin numbers and more eyes on the lookout. While pigeons play a starring role\nin urban wildlife, we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors. In 1966, New York’s parks commissioner\ncoined the term “rats with wings” and it stuck. Indeed, their poop, which we originally cherished \nas fertilizer, presents a unique problem. Just one pigeon can leave behind \n11 kilograms of acidic excrement per year, which, in the United States, \nscales to about $1.1 billion in structural damage annually. Though incidents of infection are rare, this poop can host fungi \nthat are harmful to people if inhaled. They may be numerous, noisy \nand a little too keen on your lunch, but the pigeons that swirl around us are evidence of an ancient, \nongoing relationship. Their rise to world domination has been\na collaborative effort. For better or for worse, \nwe did this to ourselves. "

But he bought his supplies from \nhis former employer, and the resentful man \nsold him rotten herbs. As Xu Xian wondered what to do with this \nuseless inventory, patients flooded into his shop. A plague had stricken the city, and he had nothing to treat them. Just as he was starting to panic, his wife, Bai Su Zhen, produced a recipe\nto use the rotten herbs as medicine. Her remedy cured all the plague-afflicted\ncitizens immediately. Xu Xian’s former boss even had to buy back\nsome of the rotten herbs to treat his own family. Shortly after, a monk named Fa Hai \napproached Xu Xian, warning him that there was \na demon in his house. The demon, he said, was Bai Su Zhen. Xu Xian laughed. His kindhearted, resourceful wife \nwas not a demon. Fa Hai insisted. He told Xu Xian to serve his wife realgar\nwine on the 5th day of the 5th month, when demons’ powers are weakest. If she wasn’t a demon, he explained, \nit wouldn’t hurt her. Xu Xian dismissed the monk politely, with no intention of serving \nBai Su Zhen the wine. But as the day approached, \nhe decided to try it. As soon as the wine touched \nBai Su Zhen’s lips, she ran to the bedroom, \nclaiming she wasn’t feeling well. Xu Xian prepared some medicine \nand went to check on her. But instead of his wife, he found a giant white serpent with a\nbloody forked tongue in the bed. He collapsed, killed by the shock. When Bai Su Zhen opened her eyes, she realized immediately what \nmust have happened. The truth was that Bai Su Zhen was \nan immortal snake with formidable magical powers. She had used her powers to take a \nhuman form and improve her and \nher husband’s fortunes. Her magic couldn’t revive Xu Xian, but she had one more idea to save him: an herb that could grant longevity \nand even bring the dead back to life, guarded by the Old Man of the South Pole in the forbidden peaks of the \nKun Lun Mountains. She rode to the mountains on a cloud, then continued on foot passed gateways \nand arches until she reached one \nmarked “beyond mortals” hanging over a silver bridge. On the other side, two of the Old Man’s disciples \nguarded the herb. Bai Su Zhen disguised herself as a monk and told them she’d come to invite \nthe Old Man to a gathering of the gods. While they relayed her message, she plucked some leaves \nfrom the herb and ran. The servants realized they had been \ntricked and chased her. Bai Su Zhen coughed up a magic ball \nand threw it at one. As the other closed in on her, she put the herb under her tongue \nfor safekeeping, but its magic forced both of them \ninto their true forms. As the crane’s long beak \nclamped around her, the Old Man appeared. Why, he asked, would she risk her life \nto steal his herb when she was already immortal? Bai Su Zhen explained \nher love for Xu Xian. Even if he didn’t want to be with her \nnow that he knew she was a demon, she was determined to \nbring him back to life. The two had a karmic connection dating \nback more than a thousand years. When Bai Su Zhen was a small snake, a beggar was about to kill her, but a kind passerby rescued her. Her rescuer was Xu Xian in a past life. Touched by her willingness \nto risk her life for him, the Old Man permitted her to leave the \nmountain with the immortal herb. Bai Su Zhen returned home \nto revive Xu Xian. When he opened his eyes, the terrified look frozen on his face \nbecame a smile. Demon or not, he was still happy to see his wife. "

        "text": "In the 1920's, the German mathematician David Hilbert devised a famous thought experiment to show us just how hard it is to wrap our minds\naround the concept of infinity. Imagine a hotel with an infinite\nnumber of rooms and a very hardworking night manager. One night, the Infinite Hotel\nis completely full, totally booked up\nwith an infinite number of guests. A man walks into the hotel\nand asks for a room. Rather than turn him down, the night manager decides\nto make room for him. How? Easy, he asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on. Every guest moves from room number \"n\" to room number \"n+1\". Since there are an infinite\nnumber of rooms, there is a new room\nfor each existing guest. This leaves room 1 open\nfor the new customer. The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guests. If, say, a tour bus unloads\n40 new people looking for rooms, then every existing guest just moves from room number \"n\" to room number \"n+40\", thus, opening up the first 40 rooms. But now an infinitely large bus with a countably infinite\nnumber of passengers pulls up to rent rooms. countably infinite is the key. Now, the infinite bus\nof infinite passengers perplexes the night manager at first, but he realizes there's a way to place each new person. He asks the guest in room 1\nto move to room 2. He then asks the guest in room 2 to move to room 4, the guest in room 3 to move to room 6, and so on. Each current guest moves\nfrom room number \"n\" to room number \"2n\" -- filling up only the infinite\neven-numbered rooms. By doing this, he has now emptied all of the infinitely many\nodd-numbered rooms, which are then taken by the people\nfiling off the infinite bus. Everyone's happy and the hotel's business\nis booming more than ever. Well, actually, it is booming\nexactly the same amount as ever, banking an infinite number\nof dollars a night. Word spreads about this incredible hotel. People pour in from far and wide. One night, the unthinkable happens. The night manager looks outside and sees an infinite line\nof infinitely large buses, each with a countably infinite\nnumber of passengers. What can he do? If he cannot find rooms for them,\nthe hotel will lose out on an infinite amount of money, and he will surely lose his job. Luckily, he remembers\nthat around the year 300 B.C.E., Euclid proved that there\nis an infinite quantity of prime numbers. So, to accomplish this\nseemingly impossible task of finding infinite beds\nfor infinite buses of infinite weary travelers, the night manager assigns\nevery current guest to the first prime number, 2, raised to the power\nof their current room number. So, the current occupant of room number 7 goes to room number 2^7, which is room 128. The night manager then takes the people\non the first of the infinite buses and assigns them to the room number of the next prime, 3, raised to the power of their seat\nnumber on the bus. So, the person in seat\nnumber 7 on the first bus goes to room number 3^7 or room number 2,187. This continues for all of the first bus. The passengers on the second bus are assigned powers of the next prime, 5. The following bus, powers of 7. Each bus follows: powers of 11, powers of 13, powers of 17, etc. Since each of these numbers only has 1 and the natural number powers of their prime number base as factors, there are no overlapping room numbers. All the buses' passengers\nfan out into rooms using unique room-assignment schemes based on unique prime numbers. In this way, the night\nmanager can accommodate every passenger on every bus. Although, there will be\nmany rooms that go unfilled, like room 6, since 6 is not a power\nof any prime number. Luckily, his bosses\nweren't very good in math, so his job is safe. The night manager's strategies\nare only possible because while the Infinite Hotel\nis certainly a logistical nightmare, it only deals with the lowest\nlevel of infinity, mainly, the countable infinity\nof the natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Georg Cantor called this level\nof infinity aleph-zero. We use natural numbers\nfor the room numbers as well as the seat numbers on the buses. If we were dealing\nwith higher orders of infinity, such as that of the real numbers, these structured strategies\nwould no longer be possible as we have no way\nto systematically include every number. The Real Number Infinite Hotel has negative number rooms in the basement, fractional rooms, so the guy in room 1/2 always suspects he has less room than the guy in room 1. Square root rooms, like room radical 2, and room pi, where the guests expect free dessert. What self-respecting night manager\nwould ever want to work there even for an infinite salary? But over at Hilbert's Infinite Hotel, where there's never any vacancy and always room for more, the scenarios faced by the ever-diligent and maybe too hospitable night manager serve to remind us of just how hard it is for our relatively finite minds to grasp a concept as large as infinity. Maybe you can help tackle these problems after a good night's sleep. But honestly, we might need you to change rooms at 2 a.m. "

        "text": "This might seem hard to believe,\nbut right now, 300 million women across the planet \nare experiencing the same thing: a period. The monthly menstrual cycle\nthat leads to the period is a reality most women on Earth\nwill go through in their lives. But why is this cycle so universal? And what makes it a cycle\nin the first place? Periods last anywhere\nbetween two and seven days, arising once within in a 28-day rotation. That whole system occurs on repeat, happening approximately 450 times\nduring a woman's life. Behind the scenes are a series\nof hormonal controls that fine tune \nthe body's internal workings to make menstruation start or stop\nduring those 28 days. This inner machinery includes two ovaries stocked with thousands of tiny sacks\ncalled follicles that each contain one oocyte,\nan unfertilized egg cell. At puberty, ovaries hold \nover 400 thousand egg cells, but release only one each month, which results in pregnancy\nor a period. Here's how this cycle unfolds. Each month beginning around puberty, the hormone-producing \npituitary gland in the brain starts releasing two substances \ninto the blood: follicle stimulating hormone\nand luteinizing hormone. When they reach the ovaries, they encourage the internal egg cells\nto grow and mature. The follicles respond \nby pumping out estrogen. The egg cells grow \nand estrogen levels peak, inhibiting the production of FSH, and telling the pituitary \nto pump out more LH. That causes only the most mature egg cell\nfrom one of the ovaries to burst out of the follicle\nand through the ovary wall. This is called ovulation, and it usually happens ten to sixteen days\nbefore the start of a period. The tiny oocyte moves \nalong the fallopian tube. A pregnancy can only occur if the egg\nis fertilized by a sperm cell within the next 24 hours. Otherwise, the egg's escapade ends, and the window for pregnancy \ncloses for that month. Meanwhile, the now empty follicle\nbegins to release progesterone, another hormone that \ntells the womb's lining to plump up with blood and nutrients in preparation for a fertilized egg\nthat may embed there and grow. If it doesn't embed, a few days later, the body's progesterone\nand estrogen levels plummet, meaning the womb stops padding out\nand starts to degenerate, eventually falling away. Blood and tissue leave the body,\nforming the period. The womb can take up to a week\nto clear out its unused contents, after which, the cycle begins anew. Soon afterwards, the ovaries begin\nto secrete estrogen again, and the womb lining thickens, getting ready to accommodate \na fertilized egg or be shed. Hormones continually \ncontrol these activities by circulating in ideal amounts\ndelivered at just the right time. The cycle keeps on turning, transforming each day and each week\ninto a milestone along its course towards pregnancy or a period. Although this cycle appears to move\nby clockwork, there's room for variation. Women and their bodies are unique, \nafter all. Menstrual cycles occur at diffferent times\nin the month, ovulation comes at various points\nin the cycle, and some periods last longer than others. Menstruation even begins and ends\nat different times in life for different women, too. In other words,\nvariations between periods are normal. Appreciating these differences\nand learning about this monthly process can empower women, giving them the tools to understand\nand take charge of their own bodies. That way, they're able to factor\nthis small cycle into a much larger cycle of life. "

        "text": "Can you imagine a party\nwhere every movement, from the slightest gesture\nto walking across the room, and every visual detail, from furniture to hemline length, were governed by a complex system\nof rules and procedures? For centuries, such rituals\nwere commonplace for European nobility. And while they've gone out of fashion, we recognize the components\nunder a familiar label: ballet. Ballet, from Italian \"balletto,\"\nor little dance, originated in Renaissance Italy\nas a combination of social dance and choreographed display\nat aristocratic gatherings. In many aspects, it was a way\nof controlling people in court with acceptable forms of behavior, such as the manner in which people\nstepped, bowed, or took someone's hand. It also involved rules governing\neverything from attire to where one could walk or sit\nin relation to the King. Over time, the study of ballet became\na central element of court life, and proper grasp of the etiquette could\nmake or break one's success as a courtier. Many of these court gestures can still\nbe seen in modern ballet techniques. Ballet was brought to France\nin the 16th century by Catherine de' Medici, the Italian wife of King Henry II. As celebrations became more lavish,\nso did the dance, with dancing masters teaching\nelaborate steps to young nobles and story elements providing\na unifying theme. The focus shifted from participation\nto performance, and the form acquired \nmore theatrical trappings, such as professionally designed sets and a slightly raised platform or stage\nwith curtains and wings. But it was in the 17th century court\nof Louis XIV that ballet was refined into the art\nwe know today. Louis himself had been trained\nin ballet from childhood. His early role as the sun god\nApollo at age fifteen cemented the central role ballet\nwould play during his reign. It also earned him the title\nof Sun King, with his splendid golden costume\nand choreography that promoted the idea of the king\nas a divinely ordained ruler. Louis would go on to perform\n80 roles in 40 major ballets, either as a majestic lead, or sometimes playing minor \nor comedic parts before emerging in the lead role\nas the end. He trained daily in ballet, as well as fencing and riding, and through his example, dancing became an essential skill\nfor all gentlemen of the era. But Louis XIV's main contribution \nto ballet was not as a performer. His founding of \nthe Royal Academy of Dance in 1661 shifted control of ballet\nfrom local guilds to the royal court. As director, he appointed his personal ballet master \nand frequent performance partner Pierre Beauchamp, who codified the five main positions \nof the body still used today. Through is collaborations\nwith Jean-Baptiste Lully, the director of the Royal Music Academy, and famed playwright Molière, Beauchamp helped establish ballet\nas a grand spectacle. And in 1669, a separate ballet academy\nwas founded. The Paris Opera Ballet survives today\nas the oldest ballet company in the world. Ballet moved away from the royal court\nto the theater and survived the democratic revolutions\nand reforms that followed over the next century. With the advent of the romantic movement, fantasy and folklore themes \nbecame common motifs. And though the influence of ballet\nin France would decline, other countries, such as Russia, would play a major role \nin its further development. Fortunately, today most of us don't\nhave to learn a complicated set of steps just to socialize at a wedding. Instead, we can go to the theater\nto see professionals who spend their lives training rigorously to perform feats that would have been\nunimagineable in Louis XIV's day. "

        "text": "Sitting around a campfire, \nyou can feel its heat, smell the woody smoke, \nand hear it crackle. If you get too close, it burns your eyes \nand stings your nostrils. You could stare at the bright\nflames forever as they twist and flicker \nin endless incarnations. But what exactly are you looking at? The flames are obviously not solid, nor are they liquid. Mingling with the air, they’re \nmore like a gas, but more visible--and more fleeting. And on a scientific level, \nfire differs from gas because gases can exist in \nthe same state indefinitely while fires always burn out eventually. One misconception is that\nfire is a plasma, the fourth state of matter in which atoms are stripped of their electrons. Like fire and unlike the\nother kinds of matter, plasmas don’t exist in a stable\nstate on earth. They only form when gas is exposed\nto an electric field or superheated to temperatures of thousands \nor tens of thousands of degrees. By contrast, fuels like wood \nand paper burn at a few hundred degrees —far below the threshold of what's usually\nconsidered a plasma. So if fire isn’t a solid, liquid, gas, or a plasma, what does that leave? It turns out fire isn’t actually\nmatter at all. Instead, it’s our sensory experience of a\nchemical reaction called combustion. In a way, fire is like the leaves\nchanging color in fall, the smell of fruit as it ripens, or a firefly’s blinking light. All of these are sensory clues that a chemical reaction is taking place. What differs about fire is that\nit engages a lot of our senses at the same time, \ncreating the kind of vivid experience we expect to come\nfrom a physical thing. Combustion creates that sensory experience using fuel, heat, and oxygen. In a campfire, when the logs are \nheated to their ignition temperature, the walls of their cells decompose, releasing sugars and other \nmolecules into the air. These molecules then react \nwith airborne oxygen to create carbon dioxide and water. At the same time, any trapped\nwater in the logs vaporizes, expands, ruptures \nthe wood around it, and escapes with a satisfying crackle. As the fire heats up, the carbon \ndioxide and water vapor created by combustion expand. Now that they’re less dense,\nthey rise in a thinning column. Gravity causes this expansion and rising, \nwhich gives flames their characteristic taper. Without gravity, molecules don’t separate by density and the flames \nhave a totally different shape. We can see all of this because combustion also generates light. Molecules emit light when heated, and the color of the light depends on the temperature of the molecules. The hottest flames are white or blue. The type of molecules in a fire can also influence flame color. For instance, any unreacted \ncarbon atoms from the logs form little clumps of soot that rise into the flames and emit the yellow-orange light we associate with a campfire. Substances like copper, calcium chloride, and potassium chloride can add their own characteristic hues to the mix. Besides colorful flames, fire also continues to generate heat\nas it burns. This heat sustains the flames by keeping the fuel at or above ignition temperature. Eventually, though, even the hottest fires run out of fuel or oxygen. Then, those twisting flames\ngive a final hiss and disappear with a wisp of smoke as if they were never there at all. "

        "text": "Most people recognize his name and know that he is famous \nfor having said something, but considering the long-lasting impact\nhis teachings have had on the world, very few people know \nwho Confucius really was, what he really said, and why. Amid the chaos of 6th Century BCE China, where warring states fought \nendlessly among themselves for supremacy, and rulers were frequently assassinated, sometimes by their own relatives, Confucius exemplified benevolence\nand integrity, and through his teaching, became one of China's \ngreatest philosophers. Born to a nobleman but raised in poverty\nfrom a very young age following the untimely \ndeath of his father, Confucius developed what would become a lifelong sympathy\nfor the suffering of the common people. Barely supporting his mother\nand disabled brother as a herder \nand account keeper at a granary, and with other odd jobs, it was only with \nthe help of a wealthy friend that Confucius was able \nto study at the Royal Archives, where his world view would be formed. Though the ancient texts there\nwere regarded by some as irrelevant relics of the past, Confucius was inspired by them. Through study and reflection, Confucius came to believe that \nhuman character is formed in the family and by education in ritual, \nliterature, and history. A person cultivated in this way\nworks to help others, guiding them by moral inspiration\nrather than brute force. To put his philosophy into practice, Confucius became an advisor to the ruler\nof his home state of Lu. But after another state sent Lu's ruler\na troop of dancing girls as a present and the ruler ignored his duties\nwhile enjoying the girls in private, Confucius resigned in disgust. He then spent the next few years\ntraveling from state to state, trying to find a worthy ruler to serve,\nwhile holding fast to his principles. It wasn't easy. In accordance with his philosophy,\nand contrary to the practice of the time, Confucius dissuaded rulers from relying\non harsh punishments and military power to govern their lands because he believed that a good ruler inspires others \nto spontaneously follow him by virtue of his ethical charisma. Confucius also believed that because the love and respect\nwe learn in the family are fundamental to all other virtues, personal duties to family sometimes\nsupersede obligations to the state. So when one duke bragged \nthat his subjects were so upright that a son testified \nagainst his own father when his father stole a sheep, Confucius informed the duke that genuinely upright fathers \nand sons protected one another. During his travels, \nConfucius almost starved, he was briefly imprisoned, and his life was threatened \nat several points. But he was not bitter. Confucius had faith that heaven\nhad a plan for the world, and he taught that a virtuous person could always find joy \nin learning and music. Failing to find the ruler he sought, Confucius returned to Lu and became a teacher and philosopher\nso influential, that he helped shaped Chinese culture and we recognize his name worldwide, \neven today. For the disciples of Confucius, he was the living embodiment of a sage\nwho leads others through his virtue, and they recorded his sayings, which eventually were edited into a book\nwe know in English as \"The Analects.\" Today, millions of people worldwide adhere\nto the principles of Confucianism, and though the precise meaning of \nhis words has been debated for millennia, when asked to summarize \nhis teachings in a single phrase, Confucius himself said, \"Do not inflict upon others \nthat which you yourself would not want.\" 2,500 years later, it's still sage advice.

        "text": "Lord Shiva— primordial destroyer of evil,\nslayer of demons, protector, and omniscient observer \nof the universe— was testing his wife’s patience. Historically, the union between \nShiva and Parvati was a glorious one. They maintained the equilibrium \nbetween thought and action on which the well-being \nof the world depended. Without Parvati as the agent of energy, \ngrowth, and transformation on Earth, Shiva would become a detached observer, \nand the world would remain static. But together, the two formed \na divine union known as Ardhanarishvara–– a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection \nto all living things. For these reasons, Parvati was worshipped\nfar and wide as the mother of the natural world–– and the essential counterpart \nto Shiva’s powers of raw creation. She oversaw humanity’s material comforts; and ensured that the Earth’s inhabitants\nwere bonded to each other physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Yet a rift had grown \nbetween these two formidable forces. While Parvati sustained daily life \nwith care and control, Shiva had begun to belittle \nhis wife’s essential work— and insisted on quarreling \nabout their roles in the universe. He believed that Brahma, \nthe Creator of the world, had conceived the material plane \npurely for his own fancy. And therefore, all material things \nwere merely distractions called māyā— nothing but a cosmic illusion. For millennia Parvati \nhad merely smiled knowingly as Shiva dismissed \nthe things she nurtured. But upon His latest rebuke, she knew she had to prove \nthe importance of her work once and for all. She took flight from the world, withdrawing her half of the cosmic energy\nthat kept the Earth turning. At her disappearance, a sudden, \nterrifying and all-encompassing scarcity enveloped the world in eerie silence. Without Parvati, \nthe land became dry and barren. Rivers shrank \nand crops shriveled in the fields. Hunger descended on humanity. Parents struggled to console \ntheir starving children while their own stomachs rumbled. With nothing to eat, people no longer\ngathered over heaped bowls of rice, but withdrew and shrank \nfrom the darkening world. To His shock and awe, Shiva also felt the profound emptiness\nleft by his wife’s absence. Despite His supreme power, He too realized that He was not immune\nto the need for sustenance, and His yearning felt \nbottomless and unbearable. As Shiva despaired \nover the desolate Earth, He came to realize that \nthe material world could not be so easily dismissed. At her husband’s epiphany, the compassionate Parvati \ncould no longer stand by and watch her devotees wasting away. To walk among them \nand restore their health, she took the form of a new avatar, carrying a golden bowl of porridge \nand armed with a jewel-encrusted ladle. As word of this hopeful figure spread, she was worshipped as Annapurna, \nthe Goddess of food. With the arrival of Annapurna, \nthe world blossomed anew. People rejoiced at fertility and food, \nand communed together to give thanks. Some believe that Annapurna first appeared\nin the sacred city of Kashi, or the Place of Freedom, \non the banks of the Ganges— where she opened a kitchen \nto fill the bellies of the people until they could eat no more. But it was not only mere mortals \nwho were served at her feast. Humbled at the scenes of earthly pleasure\nblooming all around him, Lord Shiva himself approached the goddess\nwith an empty bowl and begged for food and forgiveness. For this reason, the supreme deity \nis sometimes portrayed as a poor beggar at the mercy of Annapurna; holding her golden bowl in her left hand,\nwhile the right forms the abhaya mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance. With these symbols, \nthis powerful avatar makes it clear that the material world \nis anything but an illusion. Rather, it is a cycle of life \nthat must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths \nand rumbling bellies, to the equilibrium of the Earth. "

        "text": "Imagine two people are listening to music. What are the odds that they are listening to the exact same playlist? Probably pretty low. After all, everyone has very different tastes in music. Now, what are the odds that your body will need the exact same medical care and treatment as another person's body? Even lower. As we go through our lives, each of us will have very different needs for our own healthcare. Scientists and doctors are constantly researching ways to make medicine more personalized. One way they are doing this is by researching stem cells. Stem cells are cells that are undifferentiated, meaning they do not have a specific job or function. While skin cells protect your body, muscle cells contract, and nerve cells send signals, stem cells do not have any specific structures or functions. Stem cells do have the potential to become all other kinds of cells in your body. Your body uses stem cells to replace worn-out cells when they die. For example, you completely replace the lining of your intestines every four days. Stem cells beneath the lining of your intestines replace these cells as they wear out. Scientists hope that stem cells could be used to create a very special kind of personalized medicine in which we could replace your own body parts with, well, your own body parts. Stem cell researchers are working hard to find ways in which to use stem cells to create new tissue to replace the parts of organs that are damaged by injury or disease. Using stem cells to replace damaged bodily tissue is called regenerative medicine. For example, scientists currently use stem cells to treat patients with blood diseases such as leukemia. Leukemia is a form of cancer that affects your bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside your bones where your blood cells are created. In leukemia, some of the cells inside your bone marrow grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy stem cells that form your blood cells. Some leukemia patients can receive a stem cell transplant. These new stem cells will create the blood cells needed by the patient's body. There are actually multiple kinds of stem cells that scientists can use for medical treatments and research. Adult stem cells or tissue-specific stem cells are found in small numbers in most of your body's tissues. Tissue-specific stem cells replace the existing cells in your organs as they wear out and die. Embryonic stem cells are created from leftover embryos that are willingly donated by patients from fertility clinics. Unlike tissue-specific stem cells, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent. This means that they can be grown into any kind of tissue in the body. A third kind of stem cells is called induced pluripotent stem cells. These are regular skin, fat, liver, or other cells that scientists have changed to behave like embryonic stem cells. Like embryonic stem cells, they, too, can become any kind of cell in the body. While scientists and doctors hope to use all of these kinds of stem cells to create new tissue to heal your body, they can also use stem cells to help understand how the body works. Scientists can watch stem cells develop into tissue to understand the mechnanisms that the body uses to create new tissue in a controlled and regulated way. Scientists hope that with more research, they can not only develop specialized medicine that is specific to your body but also better understand how your body functions, both when it's healthy and when it's not.

        "text": "Water is the liquid of life. We drink it, we bathe in it, we farm, cook, and clean with it. It's the most abundant molecule in our bodies. In fact, every life form we know of would die without it. But most importantly, without water, we wouldn't have iced tea. Mmmm, iced tea. Why do these ice cubes float? If these were cubes of solid argon in a cup of liquid argon, they would sink. And the same goes for most other substances. But solid water, a.k.a. ice, is somehow less dense than liquid water. How's that possible? You already know that every water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. Let's look at a few of the molecules in a drop of water, and let's say the temperature is 25 degrees Celcius. The molecules are bending, stretching, spinning, and moving through space. Now, let's lower the temperature, which will reduce the amount of kinetic energy each of these molecules has so they'll bend, stretch, spin, and move less. And that means that on average, they'll take up less space. Now, you'd think that as the liquid water starts to freeze, the molecules would just pack together more and more closely, but that's not what happens. Water has a special kind of interaction between molecules that most other substances don't have, and it's called a hydrogen bond. Now, remember that in a covalent bond two electrons are shared, usually unequally, between atoms. In a hydrogen bond, a hydrogen atom is shared, also unequally, between atoms. One hydrogen bond looks like this. Two look like this. Here's three and four and five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, I could go on. In a single drop of water, hydrogen bonds form extended networks between hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, trillions of molecules, and these bonds are constantly breaking and reforming. Now, back to our water as it cools down. Above 4 degrees Celcius, the kinetic energy of the water molecules keeps their interactions with each other short. Hydrogen bonds form and break like high school relationships, that is to say, quickly. But below 4 degrees, the kinetic energy of the water molecules starts to fall below the energy of the hydrogen bonds. So, hydrogen bonds form much more frequently than they break and beautiful structures start to emerge from the chaos. This is what solid water, ice, looks like on the molecular level. Notice that the ordered, hexagonal structure is less dense than the disordered structure of liquid water. And you know that if an object is less dense than the fluid it's in, it will float. So, ice floats on water, so what? Well, let's consider a world without floating ice. The coldest part of the ocean would be the pitch-black ocean floor, once frozen, always frozen. Forget lobster rolls since crustaceans would lose their habitats, or sushi since kelp forests wouldn't grow. What would Canadian kids do in winter without pond hockey or ice fishing? And forget James Cameron's Oscar because the Titanic totally would have made it. Say goodbye to the white polar ice caps reflecting sunlight that would otherwise bake the planet. In fact, forget the oceans as we know them, which at over 70% of the Earth's surface area, regulate the atmosphere of the whole planet. But worst of all, there would be no iced tea. Mmmmm, iced tea.

        "text": "Take a look at this image. What might this be? A frightening monster? Two friendly bears? Or something else entirely? For nearly a century, ten inkblots like these have been used as what seems like an almost \nmystical personality test. Long kept confidential for psychologists \nand their patients, the mysterious images were said to draw\nout the workings of a person’s mind. But what can inkblots really tell us, and how does this test work? Invented in the early 20th century \nby Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach, the Rorschach Test is actually less about \nthe specific things we see, and more about our general approach \nto perception. As an amateur artist Hermann was fascinated by how visual \nperception varies from person to person. He carried this interest to \nmedical school, where he learned all our senses \nare deeply connected. He studied how our process of perception \ndoesn’t just register sensory inputs, but transforms them. And when he started working at a \nmental hospital in eastern Switzerland, he began designing a series \nof puzzling images to gain new insight into this \nenigmatic process. Using his inkblot paintings, Rorschach began quizzing hundreds \nof healthy subjects and psychiatric patients with \nthe same question: what might this be? However, it wasn’t what the test subjects \nsaw that was most important to Rorschach, but rather, how they approached the task. Which parts of the image did they \nfocus on or ignore? Did they see the image moving? Did the color on some inkblots help them \ngive better answers, or distract and overwhelm them? He developed a system to code \npeople’s responses, reducing the wide range of interpretations\nto a few manageable numbers. Now he had empirical measures to quantify \nall kinds of test takers: the creative and imaginative, the detail-oriented, the \nbig-picture perceivers, and flexible participants able \nto adapt their approach. Some people would get stuck, offering the same answer \nfor multiple blots. Others gave unusual and \ndelightful descriptions. Responses were as varied as the inkblots, which offered different kinds of \nperceptual problems– some easier to interpret than others. But analyzing the test-taker’s \noverall approach yielded real insights into \ntheir psychology. And as Rorschach tested more \nand more people, patterns began to pile up. Healthy subjects with the same \npersonalities often took remarkably similar approaches. Patients suffering from the same \nmental illnesses also performed similarly, making the test a reliable \ndiagnostic tool. It could even diagnose some conditions difficult to pinpoint with other \navailable methods. In 1921, Rorschach published his coding system \nalongside the ten blots he felt gave the most nuanced picture of people’s\nperceptual approach. Over the next several decades, the test became wildly popular in \ncountries around the world. By the 1960s, it had been officially administered \nmillions of times in the U.S. alone. Unfortunately, less than a year after \npublishing the test, Hermann Rorschach had died suddenly. Without its inventor to keep it on track, the test he had methodically gathered \nso much data to support began to be used in all sorts \nof speculative ways. Researchers gave the test \nto Nazi war criminals, hoping to unlock the psychological roots \nof mass murder. Anthropologists showed the images to \nremote communities as a sort of universal personality test. Employers made prejudiced hiring decisions\nbased on reductive decoding charts. As the test left clinics and entered \npopular culture its reputation among medical \nprofessionals plummeted, and the blots began to fall \nout of clinical use. Today, the test is still controversial, and many people assume \nit has been disproven. But a massive 2013 review of all the \nexisting Rorschach research showed that when administered properly \nthe test yields valid results, which can help diagnose mental illness or round out a patient’s \npsychological profile. It’s hardly a stand-alone key \nto the human mind– no test is. But its visual approach and lack \nof any single right answer continue to help psychologists paint\na more nuanced picture of how people see the world. Bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns \nbehind our perceptions. "

        "text": "In 2010, a parrot that spoke \nwith the same British accent as his owner went missing. They were reunited four years later, but the intervening time left\na conspicuous mark: the parrot had lost its British accent and was instead chattering\naway in Spanish. Parrots and several other birds are\nthe only other animals that produce human speech. And some parrots do it almost \nuncannily well. How is this possible? Most wild parrots are highly social. They use vocalizations for mating\nand territorial displays and to coordinate group movements. Some species have flocks \nthat continuously split and fuse, meaning individual parrots must be able\nto communicate with many others. Parrots use contact calls to interact and stay in touch when others\nare out of sight. But how exactly they use these calls\ndepends on the species and the size of their flocks. Monk parakeets, for example,\nlive in large colonies and have individualized contact calls \nthat help them stand out. Yellow-naped Amazon parrots, \non the other hand, forage in smaller groups that learn\nand share highly similar contact calls. This need for sophisticated mimicry may\npartially explain why yellow-naped Amazons and some other parrots can \nclosely imitate a wide range of sounds— including the human voice. So, how does a parrot actually declare\nthat “Polly wants a cracker”? A person would string these sounds\ntogether using their larynx, the organ at the top of their windpipe. It consists of rings of muscles \nand a vibrating membrane that controls airflow. They’d finely shape the vocalization \ninto enunciated words using their tongue and lips. For a parrot, however, the sound\nwould originate in its syrinx, located at the base of its windpipe. Many other birds have two vibrating\nmembranes within this organ. But parrots, like us, have just one. As sounds leave the airway, parrots shape\nthem using their tongues and beaks. They can do this because they have\nespecially flexible, powerful tongues that help them manipulate seeds and nuts. And while parrots’ beaks are rigid, \nthey have very flexible jaw joints, giving them a lot of control\nover how wide and how quickly they open their beaks. Like other animals \nwith learned vocalizations, parrot brains contain interconnected\nregions that allow them to hear, remember, modify, \nand produce complex sounds. But while songbirds have just one\nsong system in their brains, almost all parrots seem to have\nan additional circuit. Scientists think that this might give \nthem extra flexibility when it comes to learning the calls \nof their own species— and ours. With this specialized anatomy, parrots can bark, scream, curse, \nand recite factoids. One intrepid lost parrot managed \nto get back home after repeating his full name \nand address to helpful strangers. But these impressive abilities \nraise another question: do parrots actually understand \nwhat they’re saying? When most captive parrots talk, they’re likely attempting to form social\nbonds in the absence of their own species. Many probably have associations\nwith words and may be drawn to ones \nthat elicit certain responses— hence their capacity for profanity. But, especially after training, parrots have been observed to say things\nin the appropriate contexts and assign meaning to words— \nsaying “goodnight” at the end of the day, asking for certain treats, \nor counting and picking objects. One extensively trained \nAfrican grey parrot named Alex became the first non-human animal \nto pose an existential question when he asked what color he was. Whether they’re belting Beyoncé,\nhead-banging to classic rock, or rattling off cuss words at zoo-goers, parrots are constantly astounding us—\nas they have been for millennia. But our fascination with parrots has\nalso made them vulnerable. Sought by poachers and pet traders, while losing their habitats\nto deforestation, wild populations have decreased\ndramatically. To truly understand parrots, we need \nto preserve and study them in the wild. "

        "text": "Just between your chest and abdomen is where you’ll find one of the most\nimportant muscles you probably didn't know you had: the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES. When functioning properly, this ring of tissue plays a crucial\nrole in helping us eat. But when the LES malfunctions, it becomes the main player in heartburn --a searing, sometimes sour-tasting\nchest-spasm that many people will experience\nat some point in their lives. We know that humans have\nbeen battling heartburn for hundreds, if not thousands of years. But recently the incidence has risen, making it a common stomach \ncomplaint worldwide. When the symptoms of heartburn become more\nmore regular and intense —such as twice a week or more-- it’s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal\nReflux Disease, or GERD. But what causes this problem, and how can it be stopped? Heartburn starts in an area called the gastroesophageal junction, \nwhere the LES resides. This smooth, muscular ring of the LES is moderated by an intricate \ntree of nerve roots that connect to the brain, \nthe heart, and the lungs. After food enters the stomach\nfrom the esophagus, the muscle’s task is to stop it from surging back up again. The LES contracts, squeezing \nthe stomach entrance and creating a high pressure zone that prevents digestive acids \nfrom seeping out. But if the LES relaxes at the\nwrong moment or gradually weakens, it becomes like a faulty, ill-fitting lid, causing the area to depressurize. That allows burning stomach acid-- and even chunks of food--to spurt into the esophagus, sometimes going \nas far up as the mouth. The cause of all this internal drama has long been put down to diet. Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain ingredients that may have a\nrelaxing affect on the LES, which makes it incapable of doing its job. Other acidic foods, \nlike citrus and tomatoes, can worsen irritation of the esophagus when they leach out with stomach acid. Carbonated beverages can similarly bubble up in the stomach, forcing open the valve. But researchers have discovered\nthat food isn’t the only trigger. Smoking poses a risk, because the nicotine\nin cigarettes relaxes the LES. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol may have a similar effect. Pregnant women often experience\nmore heartburn due to the pressure of a growing baby\non their stomachs. and the levels of certain hormones \nin their bodies. Obesity can cause hernias that disrupt the anti-reflux barrier of\nthe gastroesophageal junction that normally protects \nagainst heartburn. Numerous medications, \nincluding those for asthma, high blood pressure, birth control, \nand depression can also have unintended \neffects on the LES. An occasional bout of heartburn isn't necessarily something to worry about. But, if heartburn starts happening regularly, it can weaken the LES muscle over time, letting more and more acid escape. And if it goes untreated, this can cause bigger problems. Over time, constant acid \nleakage from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esophageal tube, making it \nharder to swallow food. Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells lining the esophagus--a rare\ncondition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate the risk of esophageal cancer. Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with a range of medicines that can help neutralize or reduce stomach acid. In extreme cases, some people have surgery to tighten the LES to \nminimize their distress. But we can often stop heartburn before it reaches that point. Reducing the consumption \nof certain foods, not smoking, and maintaining \na healthy weight can all dramatically reduce reflux. With proper care we can \nhelp our LES’s keep the chemical fountain of \nour stomachs in proper order and avoid having to feel the burn. "

Her grace was known throughout the land, and many powerful princes and wealthy\nmerchants flocked to her family’s palace to seek her hand in marriage. But upon witnessing her blinding splendor\nin person, the men lost their nerve. Unimpressed with these suitors, the princess determined\nto find a husband herself. Mounting her golden chariot, \nshe travelled through rolling deserts, glittering cities \nand snow-capped mountains— rejecting many men along the way. Eventually, Savitri ventured \ndeep into the jungle, where she met a young man \nchopping wood. His name was Satyavan, and like her,\nhe loved the tranquil forest— but the princess saw he was not at peace. After talking for hours, Satyavan told\nher of his plight. His parents had once been wealthy rulers, until his father was blinded \nand overthrown in a violent coup. Now Satyavan worked tirelessly \nto support their meager new life. His determination and devotion\nmoved the princess. As they gazed into each other’s eyes,\nshe knew she’d finally found an equal. Savitri rushed home to tell\nher father the good news, only to find him conversing with Narada a traveling sage and wisest messenger \nof the Gods. At first her father was thrilled\nto learn of Satyavan, but Narada revealed a tragic prophecy:\nher betrothed had only a year to live. Savitri’s blood ran cold. She’d waited so long to find her partner—\nwas she already doomed to lose him? The princess would not accept these terms. She swore before Narada, her family, and Savitr himself that she would\nnever marry another. Satyavan was her one true love,\nand their fates were entwined forever. Moved by her powerful words, the sage told the princess to follow\nan ancient spiritual regimen. With regular prayer, periods of fasting, and preparation of special\nherbs and plants, she might be able to prolong\nSatyavan’s life. After a simple wedding, the couple\nreturned to the jungle to live in keeping with the sage’s instructions. This modest existence was a far cry\nfrom her lavish upbringing, but they were happy in each other’s\ncompany. A year passed, and the fated day arrived. On their first anniversary, \nthe sun grew horribly hot, and Satyavan’s brow began to burn, Savitri barely had time to drag \nhim into the shade, before he grew still and cold. Through her tears, the princess\nsaw an immense figure on the horizon. This was Yamraj, the God of Death, come to escort Satyavan’s soul \nto the afterlife. But Savitri was not giving up yet. She followed the god for hours\nin the beating sun. Yamraj thundered at the princess\nto leave him in peace. But even as her feet bled and throat\nburned, Savitri would not turn back. Eventually, Yamraj paused. He would grant her one wish \nas reward for her persistence, but she couldn’t ask\nfor her husband’s life. Without hesitating, Savitri asked the God \nto restore her father in-law’s sight. The wish was granted, and Yamraj rode on. But still Savitri’s footsteps\nechoed behind him. Exasperated, the God granted\nher a second wish. This time, she asked for Satyavan’s\nkingdom to be restored. Again the wish was granted, and Yamraj began his descent \ninto his subterranean kingdom. But when he glanced back, he was astounded to see \nthe bedraggled princess stumbling along. He’d never seen such devotion to the dead, and he honored her dedication\nwith one final wish. Savitri wished to be the mother\nof many children. The God agreed, and waved to dismiss her. But the princess only repeated the vow\nshe’d made one year earlier: her fate was forever entwined\nwith Satyavan. How could she bear many children,\nif Yamraj would not return her husband? Hearing this clever question the god\nrelented, knowing he’d been beaten. With Yamraj’s blessing and respect,\nSatyavan was returned to Savitri, and the two walked back \nto the land of the living, united in a love that not even\ndeath could destroy. "

After months of detective work, you’ve narrowed your suspects to \none of five people: the mayor, the tailor, the baker, the grocer, or the carpenter. You’ve invited them to dinner \nwith a simple plan: you’ll slip a square of \na rare werewolf antidote into each of their dinners. Unfortunately, your pet goat\njust ate four of the squares, and you only have one left. Luckily, the remaining square is 50 grams, and the minimum effective dose \nis 10 grams. If you can precisely divide the \nsquare into fifths you’ll have just enough \nantidote for everyone. You’ll have to use a laser-cutting tool\nto cut up the square; every other means available to you\nisn’t precise enough. There are 8 points that can act \nas starting or ending points for each cut. To use the device, you’ll\nhave to input pairs of points that tell the laser where to begin \nand end each cut, and then the laser executes\nall the cuts simultaneously. It’s okay to cut the square \ninto as many pieces as you want, as long as you can group them\ninto 10 gram portions. But you can’t fold the square \nor alter it otherwise, and you only get one shot \nat using the laser cutter. The full moon is rising,  and in a moment someone\nwill transform and tear you all apart unless you can cure them first. How can you divide the antidote \ninto perfect fifths, cure the secret werewolf, \nand save everyone? Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 When it comes to puzzles that\ninvolve cutting and rearranging, it’s often helpful to actually \ntake a piece of paper and try cutting it up to see what\nyou can get. If we cut BF and DH we’d get fourths,\nbut we need fifths. Maybe there’s a way to shave a bit off\nof a quarter to get exactly one fifth. Cutting BE looks good at first, \nbut that last cut takes a off a quarter of a quarter, leaving us with a portion of 3/16: \njust smaller than a fifth, and not enough to cure a werewolf. What if we started with BE instead? That would also give us a quarter. And is there a way to shave\njust a bit more off? Both DG and CH look promising. If we make one more cut, from A to F, we may start to notice something. With these four cuts—from B to E, \nD to G, F to A, and H to C—we’ve got four triangles and a square in the middle. But the pieces that make \neach triangle can also be rearranged to make a square\nidentical to the middle one. This means that we’ve split\nthe antidote into perfect fifths! What’s interesting about this \nsort of problem is that while it’s possible to solve \nit by starting from the geometry, it’s actually easier to start \nexperimenting and see where that gets you. That wouldn’t be as viable if the square \nhad, say, 24 cut points, but with just 8 there\nare only so many reasonable options. You secretly dose each of the townspeople as the full moon emerges in the sky. And just as you do, \na terrible transformation begins. Then, just as suddenly, it reverses. Your measurements were perfect,  and the people and animals of the \ntown can rest a little easier. "

        "text": "From the smallest single-celled organism to the largest creatures on earth, every living thing is defined \nby its genes. The DNA contained in our genes acts like\nan instruction manual for our cells. Four building blocks called bases are \nstrung together in precise sequences, which tell the cell how to behave and form the basis for our every trait. But with recent advancements \nin gene editing tools, scientists can change an organism’s\nfundamental features in record time. They can engineer drought-resistant crops and create apples that don’t brown. They might even prevent the spread \nof infectious outbreaks and develop cures for genetic diseases. CRISPR is the fastest, easiest, and \ncheapest of the gene editing tools responsible for this new wave of science. But where did this medical \nmarvel come from? How does it work? And what can it do? Surprisingly, CRISPR is actually a \nnatural process that’s long functioned as a \nbacterial immune system. Originally found defending single-celled \nbacteria and archaea against invading viruses, naturally occurring CRISPR uses \ntwo main components. The first are short snippets of \nrepetitive DNA sequences called “clustered regularly interspaced \nshort palindromic repeats,” or simply, CRISPRs. The second are Cas, or “CRISPR-associated” proteins which chop up DNA like molecular scissors. When a virus invades a bacterium, Cas proteins cut out a segment \nof the viral DNA to stitch into the bacterium’s \nCRISPR region, capturing a chemical snapshot \nof the infection. Those viral codes are then copied \ninto short pieces of RNA. This molecule plays many roles \nin our cells, but in the case of CRISPR, RNA binds to a special protein \ncalled Cas9. The resulting complexes act like scouts, latching onto free-floating \ngenetic material and searching for a match to the virus. If the virus invades again, the scout\ncomplex recognizes it immediately, and Cas9 swiftly destroys the viral DNA. Lots of bacteria have this type \nof defense mechanism. But in 2012, scientists figured out \nhow to hijack CRISPR to target not just viral DNA, but any DNA in almost any organism. With the right tools, this viral immune system becomes a \nprecise gene-editing tool, which can alter DNA and \nchange specific genes almost as easily as fixing a typo. Here’s how it works in the lab: scientists design a “guide” RNA \nto match the gene they want to edit, and attach it to Cas9. Like the viral RNA in the \nCRISPR immune system, the guide RNA directs Cas9 \nto the target gene, and the protein’s molecular scissors \nsnip the DNA. This is the key to CRISPR’s power: just by injecting Cas9 bound to a short \npiece of custom guide RNA scientists can edit practically \nany gene in the genome. Once the DNA is cut, the cell will try to repair it. Typically, proteins called nucleases trim the broken ends and \njoin them back together. But this type of repair process, called nonhomologous end joining, is prone to mistakes and can lead to extra or missing bases. The resulting gene is often unusable \nand turned off. However, if scientists add a separate \nsequence of template DNA to their CRISPR cocktail, cellular proteins can perform \na different DNA repair process, called homology directed repair. This template DNA is used as a blueprint \nto guide the rebuilding process, repairing a defective gene or even inserting a completely new one. The ability to fix DNA errors means that CRISPR could potentially \ncreate new treatments for diseases linked to specific genetic errors, like \ncystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia. And since it’s not limited to humans, the applications are almost endless. CRISPR could create plants \nthat yield larger fruit, mosquitoes that can’t transmit malaria, or even reprogram drug-resistant \ncancer cells. It’s also a powerful tool \nfor studying the genome, allowing scientists to watch \nwhat happens when genes are turned off or changed within an organism. CRISPR isn’t perfect yet. It doesn’t always make \njust the intended changes, and since it’s difficult to predict the \nlong-term implications of a CRISPR edit, this technology raises \nbig ethical questions. It’s up to us to decide the \nbest course forward as CRISPR leaves single-celled \norganisms behind and heads into labs, farms, hospitals, and organisms around the world. "

        "text": "There are few places on Earth \nless hospitable to life than the bone-dry Sahara Desert. Yet it wasn't always this way. 100 million years ago, during a period\nknown as the Mid-Cretaceous, a gargantuan river system flowed\nacross the region from modern day Egypt to Morocco. The whole world at that time\nwould look rather different to us. The continents had yet to assume\ntheir current positions. Extreme temperatures were common and fierce storms made life unpredictable. Dinosaurs flourished on land, pterosaurs roamed the skies, and giant marine reptiles and sharks\nswam in warm seas. Small mammals, our ancestors,\nlived quite literally in the shadow of these extraordinary creatures. In this world of huge predators, the River of Giants, which is what some call this region\nof what is now northern Africa, stood out as particularly dangerous. In most ecosystems, it's lonely at\nthe top of the food chain. There usually isn't enough prey\nto sustain many predators. Yet an incredible variety of aquatic\nprey species in the river-based ecosystem may have allowed a large and diverse\npopulation of apex predators to coexist. We know this thanks to a wealth of fossils\nwe found in an area called the Kem Kem Beds. Many of the predators we've discovered\nhad head and body shapes that made them uniquely adapted\nto hunt the different types and sizes of aquatic prey. This allowed many Kem Kem predators to\ntake full advantage of the one abundant food source\nin this environment: fish. This also allowed them \nto avoid direct competition with the predators going after\nland-loving animals. Prey species in the river system had to\ncontend with attacks from all sides, including from above. Flying reptiles dominated the skies. Alanqa Saharica had a wingspan of\nup to nine meters, and long slender jaws that helped it\nsnatch fish and small terrestrial animals. At least seven different types \nof crocodile-like predators patrolled the waterways, including the roughly \nten-meter-long Elosuchus. And multiple species of T-rex-sized\ncarnivorous dinosaurs called theropods, lived side by side. In the River of Giants,\nSpinosaurus was king. This 15-meter-long dinosaur was even\nlonger than T-rex, with short muscular hind legs, a flexible tail, and broad feet. It's two-meter-high sail warned\nother creatures of its fearsome size and may have also been \nused to attract mates. Spinosaurus' long slender jaws were spiked\nwith conical teeth, perfect for swiftly clamping down\non slippery aquatic prey. This apex predator, \nas well as its ecosystem, is unparalleled in the history\nof life on Earth. All that's left of these \nfearsome predators are fossils. About 93 million years ago, \nsea levels rose, submerging the Kem Kem region\nin a shallow sea. Tens of millions of years later, an asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and associated changes in climate wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and\nmany other groups of animals and plants, including their unique ecoysystems. That mass extinction paved the way\nfor the rise of new kinds of birds, larger mammals, and eventually us. "

Over an area of more \nthan 900,000 square kilometers, its people built massive \nadministrative centers, temples, and extensive road \nand canal systems. They did so in an inhospitable, \nextreme terrain, all without the use of wheels, \nhorses, iron, or even written language. Yet within 100 years of its rise \nin the fifteenth century, the Inca Empire would be no more. According to legend, the ancestors of the Inca rulers \nwere created by the sun god Inti, and they emerged\nfrom a cave called Tambo Toco. Leading four brothers \nand four sisters was Ayar Manco, who carried a golden staff \nwith instructions to find the place where \nit would sink into the ground, showing fertile soil. After many adventures \nand extensive searching, Ayar Manco and his siblings \nreached the Cuzco Valley, where the staff pierced the ground. After fighting off the fierce \nlocal native population, they founded their capital, and Ayar Manco became Manco Capac, \nthe first Sapa Inca, or king of the Incas. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Incas first settled \nin this valley around 1200 CE. They remained a small kingdom until 1438, when they were nearly overrun \nby the neighboring Chanka tribe. The Inca king at this time, Viracocha, \nand his designated heir fled in fear, but one of his other sons remained and successfully rallied \nthe city’s defenses. For his military skill, he became \nthe ninth Inca ruler, assuming the name of Pachacuti, \nor \"Cataclysm.\" Pachacuti expanded Inca rule \nthroughout the Andes mountains, transforming the kingdom into \nan empire through extensive reforms. The empire’s territory was reorganized \nas Tahuantinsuyu, or \"four quarters,\" with four divisions ruled \nby governors reporting to the king. Although the Inca had no writing, they used a complex system \nof knotted strings called quipu to record numbers \nand perhaps other information. A decimal-based bureaucracy \nenabled systematic and efficient taxation \nof the empire’s subjects. In return, the empire provided security, \ninfrastructure, and sustenance, with great storehouses containing \nnecessities to be used when needed. Great terraces and irrigation works \nwere built and various crops were grown in \nat different altitudes to be transported all over the empire. And it was during Pachacuti’s reign that the famous estate \nof Machu Picchu was constructed. Pachacuti’s son Topa Inca continued \nthe empire’s military expansion, and he eventually became ruler\nin 1471 CE. By the end of his reign, the empire \ncovered much of western South America. Topa’s son Huayna Capac \nsucceeded him in 1493. But the new ruler’s distant military \ncampaigns strained the social fabric. And in 1524, Huayna Capac \nwas stricken by fever. Spanish conquistadors had arrived \nin the Caribbean some time before, bringing diseases to which \nthe native peoples had no resistance. Millions died in the outbreak, including Huayna Capac\nand his designated heir. The vacant throne ignited a civil war\nbetween two of the surviving brothers, Atahualpa and Huascar, greatly weakening the empire. In 1532, after finally winning \nthe Inca civil war, Atahualpa and his army \nencountered the European invaders. Although greatly outnumbered, Francisco Pizarro \nand his small group of conquistadors stunned the king’s much larger force \nwith guns and horses, neither of which they had seen before. Atahualpa was taken captive \nand killed about a year later. The Spanish conquerors \nwere awed by the capital of Cuzco. Pizarro described it as so beautiful that\n“it would be remarkable even in Spain.” Though the capital had fallen and the native population had been\ndestroyed by civil war and disease, some Incas fell back to \na new capital at Vilcabamba and resisted for the next 40 years. But by 1572, the Spaniards had destroyed \nall remaining resistance along with much of the Incas’ physical \nand cultural legacy. Thus, the great Inca empire fell \neven faster than it had risen. "

Sliding a metal strip over a wooden stake, a master summoner is sending deep croaking\nnoises reverberating through the area. And, as if in a trance, hundreds of earthworms \nbegin emerging from the soil. This is worm grunting, also called\nworm charming or fiddling. It’s a tradition that’s been practiced\nfor more than a century, but its inner workings were \na mystery until only recently. Worms collectively undertaking\nan underground exodus seems especially unbelievable when you\nconsider how vulnerable this makes them. So why is surfacing worth the risk? Over the years, people have proposed\na number of imaginative hypotheses. One was that worms were somehow\ncharmed by the noise, like the rats from the medieval\nPied Piper legend. Okay, sounds fun, but how would \nthe worms actually become bewitched? Another hypothesis was that worm grunting\ntickled their bodies, so they emerged to end the aggravation. Whimsical! But worm grunting vibrates\nthe ground’s surface. If worms were evading the vibrations,\nwouldn't they burrow deeper instead? Perhaps the most popular hypothesis was\nthat worm grunting mimicked falling rain and the worms fled to avoid drowning. In 2008, biologist Kenneth Catania\ntested this hypothesis, setting up three arenas filled with soil and 300 individuals of the large species \nof earthworm found in the Florida Panhandle. After an hour of rain, \nwater had pooled at the surface, but only two earthworms emerged. The rest remained buried and healthy. So, unlike those containers, \nthis hypothesis just didn’t hold water. Catania decided to explore\nanother route of inquiry. In 1881, Charles Darwin published\nhis final work, a bestseller that rivaled his\nmost well-known books at the time: “The Formation of Vegetable Mould,\nThrough the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits.” Yes, it was literally called that— and it was the culmination of 40 years\nof earthworm investigations. Within it, Darwin noted that worms\nsometimes left their burrows when the ground trembled \nand mentioned an interesting hypothesis: maybe they flee because they believe\nthey’re being pursued by moles. Catania got to work testing\nthis hypothesis himself. He found that Eastern moles had\nastounding tracking abilities, could eat their weight in worms every day, and were abundant \nin the Florida Panhandle. When Catania released a single mole \ninto worm- and soil-filled arenas, about 30% of the worms crawled \nto the surface in the first hour— a markedly different result \nfrom the control and rain trials. And when he recorded \nthe vibrations produced by worm grunters and moles digging, their frequencies \noverlapped substantially. This was it. Over hundreds of thousands of years, these earthworms evolved a behavior\nthat helped them escape a top predator. Aboveground, they were immune\nto the moles, which usually stayed subterranean. But then humans came along. And, funnily enough, we aren’t even\nthe only ones that take advantage of this behavior. Herring gulls and wood turtles also \nsometimes drum their feet on the earth to summon worms. So then why does this behavior persist? Scientists think it’s beneficial \nfor a prey species to maintain its adaptations \nagainst a more frequent predator, even if it makes it more vulnerable \nto a rarer one. Many insects, for example, \nuse flight to avoid predation. But painted redstarts take\nadvantage of this: they boldly flash their colorful tail \nand wing feathers to elicit this response, then catch the insects \nas they try to fly away. It seems the prey species’ response \nremains simply because it’s beneficial \nmost of the time. For over a century, humans\nin the southern US, the UK, and elsewhere have been unknowingly exploiting \nthe worm’s escape response. The current world record \nfor “most worms charmed” was set by a 10-year-old \nBritish girl in 2009. Wiggling a fork in the ground \nand hitting it with a stick, she made 567 worms surface \nin just 30 minutes. Charming, really. "

Until then, chocolate only existed\nin Mesoamerica in a form quite different \nfrom what we know. As far back as 1900 BCE, the people of that region had learned\nto prepare the beans of the native cacao tree. The earliest records tell us the beans\nwere ground and mixed with cornmeal\nand chili peppers to create a drink - not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa, but a bitter, invigorating concoction\nfrothing with foam. And if you thought we make\na big deal about chocolate today, the Mesoamericans had us beat. They believed that cacao\nwas a heavenly food gifted to humans\nby a feathered serpent god, known to the Maya as Kukulkan and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. Aztecs used cacao beans as currency and drank chocolate at royal feasts, gave it to soldiers as a reward\nfor success in battle, and used it in rituals. The first transatlantic\nchocolate encounter occurred in 1519 when Hernán Cortés visited\nthe court of Moctezuma at Tenochtitlan. As recorded by Cortés's lieutenant, the king had 50 jugs of the drink\nbrought out and poured into golden cups. When the colonists returned with shipments\nof the strange new bean, missionaries' salacious accounts\nof native customs gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac. At first, its bitter taste made it\nsuitable as a medicine for ailments, like upset stomachs, but sweetening it with honey,\nsugar, or vanilla quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy\nin the Spanish court. And soon, no aristocratic home was\ncomplete without dedicated chocolate ware. The fashionable drink was difficult\nand time consuming to produce on a large scale. That involved using plantations\nand imported slave labor in the Caribbean and \non islands off the coast of Africa. The world of chocolate would change\nforever in 1828 with the introduction of the cocoa press\nby Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam. Van Houten's invention could separate\nthe cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter. This left a powder that could be mixed\ninto a drinkable solution or recombined with the cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate\nwe know today. Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier\nnamed Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix, thus inventing milk chocolate. By the 20th century, chocolate\nwas no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public. Meeting the massive demand required\nmore cultivation of cocoa, which can only grow near the equator. Now, instead of African slaves \nbeing shipped to South American cocoa plantations, cocoa production itself would shift\nto West Africa with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths\nof the world's cocoa as of 2015. Yet along with the growth\nof the industry, there have been horrific abuses\nof human rights. Many of the plantations throughout\nWest Africa, which supply Western companies, use slave and child labor, with an estimation of more than\n2 million children affected. This is a complex problem\nthat persists despite efforts from major chocolate\ncompanies to partner with African nations to reduce child \nand indentured labor practices. Today, chocolate has established itself\nin the rituals of our modern culture. Due to its colonial association with\nnative cultures, combined with the power of advertising, chocolate retains an aura\nof something sensual, decadent, and forbidden. Yet knowing more about its fascinating\nand often cruel history, as well as its production today, tells us where \nthese associations originate and what they hide. So as you unwrap \nyour next bar of chocolate, take a moment to consider that\nnot everything about chocolate is sweet. "

        "text": "What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally\ncrashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars? Actually, everything. That crash happened due to an error in converting between \ntwo measurement systems, U.S. customary units and their S.I, or metric, equivalence. So what's the connection to\nthe French Revolution? Let's explain. For the majority of recorded \nhuman history, units like the weight of a grain\nor the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place. And different regions didn't just use\nvarying measurements. They had completely different \nnumber systems as well. By the late Middle Ages,\nthe Hindu-Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numerals \nand fractions in Europe, but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins\nto promote standard decimal-based measures were less successful. With a quarter million different units\nin France alone, any widespread change would require\nmassive disruption. And in 1789, that disruption came. The leaders of the French Revolution\ndidn't just overthrow the monarchy. They sought to completely \ntransform society according to the rational principles\nof the Enlightenment. When the new government took power, the Academy of Sciences convened\nto reform the system of measurements. Old standards based on arbitrary authority\nor local traditions were replaced with mathematical\nand natural relationships. For example, the meter,\nfrom the Greek word for measure, was defined as 1/10,000,000\nbetween the Equator and North Pole. And the new metric system was,\nin the words of the Marquis de Condorcet, \"For all people, for all time.\" Standardizing measurements\nhad political advantages for the Revolutionaries as well. Nobles could no longer manipulate local\nunits to extract more rent from commoners, while the government could collect\ntaxes more efficiently. And switching to a new Republican Calendar\nwith ten-day weeks reduced church power \nby eliminating Sundays. Adoption of this new system wasn't easy. In fact, it was a bit of a mess. At first, people used new units\nalongside old ones, and the Republican Calendar \nwas eventually abandoned. When Napoléon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses \nto use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms. But the metric system remained standard\nfor formal use, and it spread across the continent,\nalong with France's borders. While Napoléon's empire \nlasted eight years, its legacy endured far longer. Some European countries reverted\nto old measurements upon independence. Others realized the value \nof standardization in an age of international trade. After Portugal and the Netherlands\nswitched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system\naround the world. As France's main rival, Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas\nand retained its traditional units. But over the next two centuries,\nthe British Empire slowly transitioned, first approving the metric system\nas an optional alternative before gradually making it offical. However, this switch came too late\nfor thirteen former colonies that had already gained independence. The United States of America stuck with\nthe English units of its colonial past and today remains one \nof only three countries which haven't fully embraced \nthe metric system. Despite constant initiatives \nfor metrication, many Americans consider units like feet\nand pounds more intuitive. And ironically, some regard the once\nrevolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity. Nevertheless, the metric system is almost\nuniversally used in science and medicine, and it continues to evolve according\nto its original principles. For a long time, standard units were actually defined by \ncarefully maintained physical prototypes. But thanks to improving technology\nand precision, these objects with limited access\nand unreliable longevity are now being replaced with standards\nbased on universal constants, like the speed of light. Consistent measurements are such\nan integral part of our daily lives that it's hard to appreciate what a major\naccomplishment for humanity they've been. And just as it arose \nfrom a political revolution, the metric system remains crucial\nfor the scientific revolutions to come. "

This absurd premise \nforms the central plot of Mikhail Bulgakov’s masterpiece,\n\"The Master and Margarita.\" Written in Moscow during the 1930s, this surreal blend \nof political satire, historical fiction, and occult mysticism has earned a legacy as one \nof the 20th century’s greatest novels– and one of its strangest. The story begins \nwhen a meeting between two members of Moscow’s literary elite is interrupted by a strange gentleman \nnamed Woland, who presents himself as a foreign scholar invited to give a presentation \non black magic. As the stranger engages the two companions\nin a philosophical debate and makes ominous predictions \nabout their fates, the reader is suddenly transported \nto 1st century Jerusalem. There a tormented Pontius Pilate reluctantly sentences \nJesus of Nazareth to death. With the narrative \nshifting between the two settings, Woland and his entourage– \nAzazello, Koroviev, Hella, and a giant cat named Behemoth– are seen to have uncanny magical powers, which they use to stage their performance while leaving a trail \nof havoc and confusion in their wake. Much of the novel’s dark humor \ncomes not only from this demonic mischief, but also the backdrop \nagainst which it occurs. Bulgakov’s story takes place \nin the same setting where it was written– the USSR \nat the height of the Stalinist period. There, artists and authors \nworked under strict censorship, subject to imprisonment, \nexile, or execution if they were seen \nas undermining state ideology. Even when approved, their work– along with housing, travel, \nand everything else– was governed by a convoluted bureaucracy. In the novel, Woland manipulates this system \nalong with the fabric of reality, to hilarious results. As heads are separated from bodies \nand money rains from the sky, the citizens of Moscow \nreact with petty-self interest, illustrating how Soviet society \nbred greed and cynicism despite its ideals. And the matter-of-fact narration deliberately blends \nthe strangeness of the supernatural events with the everyday absurdity \nof Soviet life. So how did Bulgakov \nmanage to publish such a subversive novel under an oppressive regime? Well… he didn’t. He worked on \"The Master and Margarita\"\nfor over ten years. But while Stalin’s personal favor may have kept Bulgakov \nsafe from severe persecution, many of his plays and writings \nwere kept from production, leaving him safe but effectively silenced. Upon the author’s death in 1940, the manuscript remained unpublished. A censored version \nwas eventually printed in the 1960s, while copies of the unabridged manuscript continued to circulate \namong underground literary circles. The full text was only published in 1973, over 30 years after its completion. Bulgakov’s experiences \nwith censorship and artistic frustration lend an autobiographical air \nto the second part of the novel, when we are finally \nintroduced to its namesake. \"The Master\" is a nameless author \nwho’s worked for years on a novel but burned the manuscript \nafter it was rejected by publishers– just as Bulgakov \nhad done with his own work. Yet the true protagonist \nis the Master’s mistress Margarita. Her devotion \nto her lover’s abandoned dream bears a strange connection \nto the diabolical company’s escapades– and carries the story \nto its surreal climax. Despite its dark humor \nand complex structure, \"The Master and Margarita\" \nis, at its heart, a meditation on art, love, and redemption, that never loses itself in cynicism. And the book’s long overdue publication \nand survival against the odds is a testament \nto what Woland tells the Master: “Manuscripts don’t burn.” "

        "text": "Imagine that one day,\nyou're summoned before a government panel. Even though you haven't \ncommitted any crime, or been formally charged with one, you are repeatedly questioned\nabout your political views, accused of disloyalty, and asked to incriminate your friends\nand associates. If you don't cooperate,\nyou risk jail or losing your job. This is exactly what happened in\nthe United States in the 1950s as part of a campaign to expose\nsuspected communists. Named after its most \nnotorious practitioner, the phenomenon known as McCarthyism\ndestroyed thousands of lives and careers. For over a decade, American political \nleaders trampled democratic freedoms in the name of protecting them. During the 1930s and 1940s, there had been an active but small\ncommunist party in the United States. Its record was mixed. While it played crucial roles in wider \nprogressive struggles for labor and civil rights, it also supported the Soviet Union. From the start, the American \nCommunist Party faced attacks from conservatives and business leaders, as well as from liberals who criticized\nits ties to the oppressive Soviet regime. During World War II, when the USA\nand USSR were allied against Hitler, some American communists actually\nspied for the Russians. When the Cold War escalated\nand this espionage became known, domestic communism came to be seen\nas a threat to national security. But the attempt to eliminate that threat soon turned into the longest lasting\nand most widespread episode of political repression \nin American history. Spurred on by a network of bureaucrats, politicians, journalists, and businessmen, the campaign wildly exaggerated\nthe danger of communist subversion. The people behind it harassed anyone suspected of holding \nleft-of-center political views or associating with those who did. If you hung modern art on your walls, had a multiracial social circle, or signed petitions against\nnuclear weapons, you might just have been a communist. Starting in the late 1940s, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover used the resources of his agency\nto hunt down such supposed communists and eliminate them from any\nposition of influence within American society. And the narrow criteria that Hoover\nand his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public\nand private employers were imposing the same political tests\non the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted \nits own witchhunt subpoenaing hundreds of people\nto testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American \nActivities Committee. If they refused to cooperate,\nthey could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly, fired and blacklisted. Ambitious politicians, like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, used such hearings as a partisan weapon accusing democrats \nof being soft on communism and deliberately losing China\nto the Communist Bloc. McCarthy, a Republican senator \nfrom Wisconsin became notorious by flaunting\never-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Egged on by other politicians, he continued to make \noutrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy\nwhile others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out,\nMcCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee\non investigations in 1953, McCarthy recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that \nfinally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues \nin the Senate censured him and he died less than three years later,\nprobably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds, \nif not thousands, of lives and drastically narrowed the American\npolitical spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions\nwould be long lasting. In all likelihood, there were both\nDemocrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist\npurges were deeply unjust but feared that directly opposing them\nwould hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed\nto stop the witchhunt, condoning serious violations\nof constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual\nthreat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme\nthat it caused far more damage than the threat itself. And if new demagogues appeared\nin uncertain times to attack unpopular minorities\nin the name of patriotism, could it all happen again? "

        "text": "In the summer of 1997, NASA's Pathfinder spacecraft landed \non the surface of Mars, and began transmitting incredible,\niconic images back to Earth. But several days in, \nsomething went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect, \nprocrastinating: keeping itself fully occupied \nbut failing to do its most important work. What was going on? There was a bug, it turned out, \nin its scheduler. Every operating system has something \ncalled the scheduler that tells the CPU how long\nto work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly \nbetween their various responsibilities, they give the illusion \nof doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens\nwhen things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else, \nsome measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science \nof scheduling can give us some ideas about our own\nhuman struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all \nthe time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't spending doing it. For instance, let's say when you check \nyour inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once you've dealt with that one, \nyou repeat. Seems sensible, \nbut there's a problem here. This is what's known \nas a quadratic-time algorithm. With an inbox that's twice as\nfull, these passes will take twice as long and you'll need to do \ntwice as many of them! This means four times the work. The programmers \nof the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single \none of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time \nranking tasks than doing them. The programmers’ counterintuitive solution\nwas to replace this full ranking with a limited number \nof priority “buckets.” The system was less precise \nabout what to do next but more than made up for it \nby spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always \ndoing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller \nthan normal could take nine times longer to clear. You’d be better off replying \nin chronological order, or even at random! Surprisingly, sometimes giving up \non doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges \nfrom computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent \nfeatures of modern life: interruptions. When a computer goes \nfrom one task to another, it has to do what's called \na context switch, bookmarking its place in one task, moving old data out of its memory \nand new data in. Each of these actions comes at a cost. The insight here is that there’s \na fundamental tradeoff between productivity and responsiveness. Getting serious work done \nmeans minimizing context switches. But being responsive means reacting \nanytime something comes up. These two principles \nare fundamentally in tension. Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where \nwe want to strike that balance. The obvious solution \nis to minimize interruptions. The less obvious one is to group them. If no notification \nor email requires a response more urgently than once an hour, say, then that’s exactly how often \nyou should check them. No more. In computer science, this idea goes by \nthe name of interrupt coalescing. Rather than dealing with \nthings as they come up – Oh, the mouse was moved? A key was pressed? More of that file downloaded? – the system groups these \ninterruptions together based on how long they can afford to wait. In 2013, interrupt coalescing triggered a massive improvement \nin laptop battery life. This is because deferring interruptions \nlets a system check everything at once, then quickly re-enter a low-power state. As with computers, so it is with us. Perhaps adopting a similar approach might allow us users \nto reclaim our own attention, and give us back one of the things\nthat feels so rare in modern life: rest. "

How about African King Musa Keita I? Ruling the Mali Empire \nin the 14th century CE, Mansa Musa, or the King of Kings, amassed a fortune that possibly made him one of the wealthiest \npeople who ever lived. But his vast wealth was only\none piece of his rich legacy. When Mansa Musa came to power in 1312, much of Europe was racked \nby famine and civil wars. But many African kingdoms\nand the Islamic world were flourishing, and Mansa Musa played a great role\nin bringing the fruits of this flourishing to his own realm. By strategically annexing \nthe city of Timbuktu, and reestablishing power \nover the city of Gao, he gained control \nover important trade routes between the Mediterranean \nand the West African Coast, continuing a period of expansion,\nwhich dramatically increased Mali's size. The territory of the Mali Empire\nwas rich in natural resources, such as gold and salt. The world first witnessed the extent\nof Mansa Musa's wealth in 1324 when he took his pilgrimage to Mecca. Not one to travel on a budget, he brought a caravan stretching\nas far as the eye could see. Accounts of this journey are mostly\nbased on an oral testimony and differing written records, so it's difficult to determine\nthe exact details. But what most agree on is the extravagant\nscale of the excursion. Chroniclers describe an entourage \nof tens of thousands of soldiers, civilians, and slaves, 500 heralds bearing gold staffs\nand dressed in fine silks, and many camels and horses\nbearing an abundance of gold bars. Stopping in cities such as Cairo, Mansa Musa is said to have spent\nmassive quantities of gold, giving to the poor, buying souvenirs, and even having mosques \nbuilt along the way. In fact, his spending may have \ndestabilized the regional economy, causing mass inflation. This journey reportedly took over a year,\nand by the time Mansa Musa returned, tales of his amazing wealth had spread\nto the ports of the Mediterranean. Mali and its king were elevated\nto near legendary status, cemented by their inclusion \non the 1375 Catalan Atlas. One of the most important world maps\nof Medieval Europe, it depicted the King holding a scepter\nand a gleaming gold nugget. Mansa Musa had literally put his empire\nand himself on the map. But material riches weren't \nthe king's only concern. As a devout Muslim, \nhe took a particular interest in Timbuktu, already a center of religion \nand learning prior to its annexation. Upon returning from his pilgrimage, he had the great \nDjinguereber Mosque built there with the help of \nan Andalusian architect. He also established a major university,\nfurther elevating the city's reputation, and attracting scholars and students\nfrom all over the Islamic world. Under Mansa Musa,\nthe Empire became urbanized, with schools and mosques\nin hundreds of densely populated towns. The king's rich legacy \npersisted for generations and to this day, there are mausoleums,\nlibraries and mosques that stand as a testament \nto this golden age of Mali's history. "

Peseshet packs up to leave,\nbut the woman has another question. She wants to find out if she is pregnant. Peseshet explains \nher fail-safe pregnancy test: plant two seeds: one barley, one emmer. Then, urinate on the seeds every day. If the plants grow, she’s pregnant. A barley seedling predicts a baby boy, while emmer foretells a girl. Peseshet also recommends a prayer\nto Hathor, goddess of fertility. When Peseshet finally arrives \nat the House of Life, she runs into the doctor-priest Isesi. She greets Isesi politely, but she thinks\npriests are very full of themselves. She doesn’t envy Isesi’s role \nas neru pehut, which directly translates to herdsman \nof the anus to the royal family, or, guardian of the royal anus. Inside, the House of Life is bustling \nas usual with scribes, priests, doctors, and students. Papyri containing all kinds of records, \nnot just medical information, are stored here. Peseshet’s son Akhethetep is hard \nat work copying documents as part of his training \nto become a scribe. He’s a particularly promising student, but he was admitted to study \nbecause Peseshet is a scribe, as was her father before her. Without family in the profession, it’s very difficult for boys, \nand impossible for girls, to pursue this education. Peseshet oversees all the female \nswnws and swnws-in-training in Memphis. The men have their own overseer, as the male doctors \nwon’t answer to a woman. Today, Peseshet teaches anatomy. She quizzes her students on the metu, the body’s vessels that transport blood, air, urine, and even bad spirits. Peseshet is preparing to leave when a pale, thin woman accosts her \nat the door and begs to be examined. The woman has a huge, \nsore lump under her arm. Peseshet probes the growth \nand finds it cool to the touch and hard like an unripe hemat fruit. She has read about ailments \nlike this, but never seen one. For this tumor there is no treatment, \nmedicine or spell. All the texts give the same advice: \ndo nothing. After delivering the bad news, \nPeseshet goes outside. She lingers on the steps\nof the House of Life, admiring the city at dusk. In spite of all her hard work, there will always be patients \nshe can’t help, like the woman with the tumor. They linger with her,\nbut Peseshet has no time to dwell. In a few short weeks, the Nile’s annual flooding will begin, bringing life to the soil for \nthe next year’s harvest and a whole new crop of patients. "

        "text": "Your friend’s birthday is tomorrow,\nand he’s turning... well... the issue \nis that you’ve forgotten. He’s older than 1, but beyond that,\nhe looks timeless. You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200. The birthday boy is a giant, and you're afraid that if your\nforgetfulness becomes known, you'll become part of the feast. The baker has meticulously prepared\na small mountain range of a cake, and your job is to sculpt the giant’s age\nas the chocolate centerpiece. You would love to just count\nthe candles on the cake, but you're much too small\nto see the top of it. Then you remember: the baker made\nan interior tunnel to activate the candles from below. While the giant is asleep, \nyou can sneak in, count the candles and escape undetected. As night sets, you pull on a full bodysuit\nand brace yourself for vanilla cream. Anywhere in the tunnel, you can see \nwhether the candle above you is lit, and can switch it on or off. Some are currently on, and others off,\nin no discernible pattern. The tunnel is a single loop, and in the \ndark you can’t tell its shape or size. You aren’t carrying anything with you,\nand any marks you make will disappear. You need a strategy. How can you count the candles? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are a few ways \nto solve this problem. Let's start with the most straightforward. There’s exactly one way to mark\na location in the tunnel: the state of the candle. You can mark the first candle you reach \nby lighting it or keeping it on. If you walk forward, you’ll eventually\nfind another lit candle— either a new one or you’re starting one. The question is: how could you know which? Here’s one approach: turn it off \nand backtrack to the start by passing the same number of candles \nyou passed on the way there. If the starting candle is now off, you’ve completed the loop\nand know the giant’s age! Otherwise, depart again, \ncontinuing until the next lit candle, testing if it’s your starting one \nand so on. This will work... eventually. But if the giant isn’t young,\nand many candles are on, you might have a marathon to run\nbetween now and sunrise. And you definitely don’t want to be \nin the cake when he starts digging in. So let’s look for a more \nefficient solution. How about testing a series of hypotheses\nabout the giant's age? Suppose you guess he’s turning 10. You could light the starting candle, \nwalk forward 10, switch or leave the destination \ncandle off, and return. If the starting candle’s still on,\n10 isn’t the answer. If it’s off, 10 could be right, \nbut you may have made multiple loops— so 10′s factors 5 and 2\nare also possibilities. Then you would have passed\na repeating pattern— but that could have just been\nthe starting arrangement. So what if you changed the candles\non the way? If you turned them all on while walking \nfrom candle 1 to 11, switch that off, then turn back, the first unlit candle you find \nwould tell you the exact candle count. And if you don't hit any\nextinguished candles, you'll know that the total\nmust be higher than 10. You could then pick a larger guess\nand try again. To be systematic, you could increase \nyour guess by the same number each time, say 4. If there were 99 candles, this method would take 24 roundtrips \nand involve visiting nearly 2,700 candles. But you don’t have to increase\nyour guess linearly. For instance, you could double it, \nfrom 10 to 20 to 40, and discover the true number \non your 5th trip after around 560 candles. Doubling allows you to reach\nhigh numbers quickly, while starting with small intervals \nin case there are only a few candles. After expecting a lengthy trek, you’re pleased to discover \nthe giant is only turning 12. You hurry to change into slightly\nmore inconspicuous clothing; chisel up some enormous chocolate numbers;\nand at the party, make your own wish: that you’re not downwind when your friend \nblows out his candles.

She’s well stocked with the essentials \nshe needs to treat her patients. Peseshet is a swnw, or a doctor. In order to become one, she had to train as a scribe and study the medical papyri stored \nat the Per Ankh, the House of Life. Now, she teaches her own students there. Before teaching, \nPeseshet has a patient to see. One of the workers at the temple \nconstruction site has injured his arm. When Peseshet arrives, the laborer’s arm is clearly broken, and worse, the fracture is a sed, \nwith multiple bone fragments. Peseshet binds and immobilizes the injury.

        "text": "Each year in the United States, players of sports \nand recreational activities receive between 2.5 \nand 4 million concussions. How dangerous are all those concussions? The answer is complicated, and lies in how the brain responds\nwhen something strikes it. The brain is made of soft fatty tissue,\nwith a consistency something like jello. Inside its protective membranes\nand the skull's hard casing, this delicate organ \nis usually well-shielded. But a sudden jolt can make the brain shift and bump against \nthe skull's hard interior, and unlike jello, the brain's tissue\nisn't uniform. It's made of a vast network\nof 90 billion neurons, which relay signals through their long\naxons to communicate throughout the brain and control our bodies. This spindly structure makes \nthem very fragile so that when impacted, neurons\nwill stretch and even tear. That not only disrupts their ability\nto communicate but as destroyed axons begin\nto degenerate, they also release toxins\ncausing the death of other neurons, too. This combination of events causes\na concussion. The damage can manifest \nin many different ways including blackout, headache, blurry vision, balance problems, altered mood and behavior, problems with memory, \nthinking, and sleeping, and the onset of anxiety and depression. Every brain is different, which explains why people's experiences\nof concussions vary so widely. Luckily, the majority of concussions\nfully heal and symptoms disappear\nwithin a matter of days or weeks. Lots of rest and a gradual return\nto activity allows the brain to heal itself. On the subject of rest, many people have heard that\nyou're not supposed to sleep shortly after receiving a concussion\nbecause you might slip into a coma. That's a myth. So long as doctors aren't concerned there\nmay also be a more severe brain injury, like a brain bleed, there's no documented problem with\ngoing to sleep after a concussion. Sometimes, victims of concussion can\nexperience something called post-concussion syndrome, or PCS. People with PCS may experience\nconstant headaches, learning difficulties, and behavioral symptoms that even\naffect their personal relationships for months or years after the injury. Trying to play through a concussion,\neven for only a few minutes, or returning to sports too soon\nafter a concussion, makes it more likely to develop PCS. In some cases, a concussion \ncan be hard to diagnose because the symptoms unfold slowly\nover time. That's often true of \nsubconcussive impacts which result from lower impact jolts\nto the head than those that cause concussions. This category of injury doesn't cause\nnoticable symptoms right away, but can lead to severe degenerative\nbrain diseases over time if it happens repeatedly. Take soccer players, who are known\nfor repeatedly heading soccer balls. Using a technique called\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging, we're beginning to find out what effect\nthat has on the brain. This method allows scientists to find\nlarge axon bundles and see how milder blows\nmight alter them structurally. In 2013, researchers using \nthis technique discovered that athletes who had \nheaded the ball most, about 1,800 times a year, had damaged the structural integrity\nof their axon bundles. The damage was similar to how\na rope will fail when the individual fibers start to fray. Those players also performed worse\non short-term memory tests, so even though no one suffered\nfull-blown concussions, these subconcussive hits added up\nto measurable damage over time. In fact, researchers know that an\noverload of subconcussive hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease\nknown as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. People with CTE suffer from changes\nin their mood and behavior that begin appearing in their 30s or 40s followed by problems with thinking\nand memory that can, in some cases, even result\nin dementia. The culprit is a protein called tau. Usually, tau proteins support tiny tubes\ninside our axons called microtubules. It's thought that repeated subconcussive\nhits damage the microtubules, causing the tau proteins to dislodge\nand clump together. The clumps disrupt transport\nand communication along the neuron and drive the breakdown of connections\nwithin the brain. Once the tau proteins \nstart clumping together, they cause more clumps to form and continue to spread \nthroughout the brain, even after head impacts have stopped. The data show that at least\namong football players, between 50 and 80% of concussions\ngo unreported and untreated. Sometimes that's because it's hard to tell a concussion has occurred \nin the first place. But it's also often due to pressure\nor a desire to keep going despite the fact that something's wrong. This doesn't just undermine recovery. It's also dangerous. Our brains aren't invincible. They still need us to shield \nthem from harm and help them undo damage\nonce it's been done. "

        "text": "In the summer of 1895, \ncrowds flooded the Coney Island boardwalk to see the latest marvel \nof roller coaster technology: the Flip Flap Railway. This was America’s first-ever looping coaster – but its thrilling flip came at a price. The ride caused numerous cases of \nsevere whiplash, neck injury and even ejections, all due to its signature loop. Today, coasters can pull off \nfar more exciting tricks, without resorting to the “thrill” \nof a hospital visit. But what exactly are roller coasters \ndoing to your body, and how have they managed to get scarier\nand safer at the same time? At the center of every roller coaster \ndesign is gravity. Unlike cars or transit trains, most coasters are propelled around their tracks almost entirely by gravitational energy. After the coaster crests the initial lift hill, it begins an expertly engineered cycle – building potential energy on ascents\nand expending kinetic energy on descents. This rhythm repeats throughout the ride, acting out the coaster engineer’s\nchoreographed dance of gravitational energy. But there’s a key variable in this cycle\nthat wasn’t always so carefully considered: you. In the days of the Flip-Flap, ride designers were most concerned \nwith coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track. This led early builders to overcompensate, hurling trains down hills and pulling on the brakes \nwhen they reached the station. But as gravity affects the cars, \nit also affects the passengers. And under the intense conditions\nof a coaster, gravity’s effects are multiplied. There’s a common unit used by jet pilots, astronauts, and coaster designers called “g force”. One G force is the familiar tug of gravity\nyou feel when standing on Earth – this is the force of Earth’s \ngravitational pull on our bodies. But as riders accelerate and decelerate, they experience more or less \ngravitational force. Modern ride designers know that the \nbody can handle up to roughly 5 Gs, but the Flip-Flap and its contemporaries \nroutinely reached up to 12 Gs. At those levels of gravitational pressure, blood is sent flying from your brain\nto your feet, leading to light-headedness or blackouts as the brain struggles to stay conscious. And oxygen deprivation in the retinal cells\nimpairs their ability to process light, causing greyed out vision or temporary blindness. If the riders are upside down,\nblood can flood the skull, causing a bout of crimson vision\ncalled a “redout”. Conversely, negative G’s \ncreate weightlessness. Within the body, short-term weightlessness\nis mostly harmless. It can contribute to a rider’s \nmotion sickness by suspending the fluid in \ntheir inner ears which coordinates balance. But the bigger potential danger – and thrill – comes from what ride designers \ncall airtime. This is when riders typically\nexperience seat separation, and, without the proper precautions, ejection. The numerous belts and harnesses \nof modern coasters have largely solved this issue, but the passenger’s ever-changing position\ncan make it difficult to determine what needs to be \nstrapped down. Fortunately, modern ride designers\nare well aware of what your body, and the coaster, can handle. Coaster engineers play these competing \nforces against each other, to relieve periods of intense pressure\nwith periods of no pressure at all. And since a quick transition from \npositive to negative G-force can result in whiplash, headaches, \nand back and neck pain, they avoid the extreme changes\nin speed and direction so common in thrill rides of old. Modern rides are also much sturdier, closely considering the amount\nof gravity they need to withstand. At 5 G’s, your body feels 5 times heavier; so if you weigh 100lbs, you’d exert the weight of 500 lbs\non the coaster. Engineers have to account for \nthe multiplied weight of every passenger when designing \na coaster’s supports. Still, these rides aren’t for everyone. The floods of adrenaline, \nlight-headedness, and motion sickness aren’t going anywhere soon. But today’s redundant restraints, \n3D modeling and simulation software have made roller coasters safer \nand more thrilling than ever. Our precise knowledge about the \nlimits of the human body have helped us build coasters that are \nfaster, taller, and loopier – and all without going off the rails. "

But once certain business \nopportunities emerged— namely, the prospect of exporting sugar\nto the US tariff-free— some of their descendants\nshifted positions. They formed a political group \nknown as “the Missionary Party” and began plotting to annex Hawaii,\nbringing it under US control. Lili’uokalani and her siblings were born\ninto an ali’i family. In 1874, her brother, Kalākaua, \nascended the throne, but thirteen years into his reign,\nthe emerging threat crystallized. The Missionary Party called a meeting\nwhere an all-white militia surrounded and forced the king \nto sign new legislation. Later called the Bayonet Constitution, it stripped Native Hawaiians \nof their rights, diminished the monarchy’s power, and ceded control to this group\nof white businessmen. Four years later, King Kalākaua died, heartbroken, Lili’uokalani said, “by the base ingratitude of the very \npersons whose fortunes he had made.” Prepared to fight, she assumed the throne. Despite death threats \nand rumors of insurgency, Queen Lili’uokalani was determined\nto restore power to her people— an estimated two thirds of whom \nhad lost their voting rights. Flooded with requests for change, \nshe authored a new constitution. But before she introduced it, \nthe so-called “Committee of Safety,” a new organization that consisted \nof many Missionary Party members, hatched another plot. Under the false pretense \nthat this new constitution endangered American property and lives, they staged a coup on January 17th, 1893. More than 160 US Marines\nmarched to the palace, where the “Committee of Safety” \nremoved Queen Lili’uokalani from office. Thousands of Hawaiian people protested, some wearing hat bands reading, \n“Aloha ’Āina,” or “love of the nation.” The alleged “Provisional Government”\ndeclared Hawaii a Republic the following year. They proclaimed \nthat Hawaiians couldn’t vote or be government employees without signing\na new “oath of allegiance.” Many refused. The following year, \nsome of Lili’uokalani’s supporters attempted a counterrevolution. The Republic responded brutally, jailing hundreds\nand sentencing six people to death. In exchange for their release, the Republic made Lili’uokalani \nsign a document that claimed to relinquish her throne,\nand they imprisoned her in the palace. Under constant guard, she composed songs \nexpressing her love for her people and began making a patchwork quilt\nthat told the story of her life. While she was only allowed news\nthat had been reviewed by her jailers, her supporters often brought her bouquets\nfrom the garden she’d dedicated to them, wrapped in newspaper. After 8 months, Lili’uokalani was placed \nunder house arrest. As soon as it was lifted, she traveled\nto Washington, D.C. with Hawaiian nationalists\nand over 20,000 signatures. There they successfully convinced Congress\nto halt the Republic’s annexation treaty. But the following year, \nthe Spanish-American War began. Seeing Hawaii \nas a strategic military base, President William McKinley declared \nit a US territory on July 7th, 1898— breaking international law and devastating\nQueen Lili’uokalani and her people. She spent the rest of her life petitioning\nfor the restoration of her lands, Native Hawaiian rights, \nand national liberation. When she died in 1917, \nthese dreams were unrealized. A member of the group that forced \nQueen Lili’uokalani out of office once declared, “If we are ever to have \npeace and annexation the first thing to do \nis obliterate the past.” They failed at this goal. Queen Lili’uokalani left\na resilient legacy: Her commitment to her land and people\nnever wavered and many Hawaiians continue to fight\nin her memory. Speaking of Hawaii’s children,\nQueen Lili’uokalani said, “It is for them that I would give\nthe last drop of my blood.” "

        "text": "As archaeologists pored over ancient tombs\nin Turfan in western China, they discovered some surprisingly\nwell-preserved and familiar relics. Though hardened from over 1,000 years, there sat little crescent-shaped\ndumplings. Exactly who invented dumplings\nremains a mystery. But some scholars suspect \nthey were first spread around parts the ancient world \nby nomadic Turkic peoples living in western China and Central Asia. This is thought to be the case \nbecause “manti,” meaning “dumpling” or “steamed bun”\nin many Turkic languages, appears to be the root word for dumpling\nin several other languages. Ancient Turkic people probably stuffed\ntheir dumplings with meat. But it’s unclear when \nthis practice began, or whether they learned the art \nof dumpling-making from others. However this happened, dumplings certainly\ngathered steam in ancient China. That’s where they first appear \nin the written record: more than 1,700 years ago, in a mouthwatering rhapsody \nby scholar Shu Xi. In his poem, Shu alludes to certain \ncooking methods coming from alien lands. He describes a steamed wheat\nproduct as “mantou.” And he reverentially chronicles \nthe preparation of kneaded dough balls called “lao wan.” They’re packed with pork, \nmutton and aromatics, dipped in black meat sauce, \nthen quickly gobbled up, leaving people downwind to drool \nand fantasy-feast. Dumplings continued to take \noff and diversify in China over the next thousand years. Instead of the traditional meat filling, some communities opted \nfor vegetarian dumplings. People developed new cooking methods. And because wheat was harder to cultivate\noutside of northern China, those in other regions began \nmaking dumplings using rice, tapioca, and sweet potato. The relationship between Chinese dumplings\nand those in other areas is tricky to trace, but food historians have made their best\nguesses based on available clues. Turkic tribes spread \nand eventually established the Ottoman Empire around 1300 CE, bringing wrapped morsels west with them. In what’s now Turkey, most people \nwouldn’t have stuffed dumplings with pork due to Islamic restrictions. Instead, manti would come to be filled \nwith ingredients like lamb, drizzled with garlic, yogurt,\nand melted butter, then topped with herbs and spices. Some scholars believe that the Mongol\nEmpire also helped disseminate dumplings, perhaps introducing them \nto parts of Eastern Europe. These dumplings could have \ncome by way of China or directly from some of the Turkic \npeoples the Mongols hired to run their empire. One theory is that this gave rise\nto dumplings like Russian pelmeni, and the larger pierogi and vareniki,\neaten in Poland and Ukraine, stuffed with things like potato, cabbage,\ncheese, and cherries. The Mongol Empire also controlled Korea and might have likewise introduced\ndumplings there, where “mandu” may be eaten \nwith regional ingredients like kimchi. Later, after Chinese dumpling varieties\nwere introduced to more countries, English speakers began calling\nthem dumplings. The term means “little lumps” and is thought to have been first\nused in 16th century England to describe dough balls dropped in liquid. Like knödel and matzo balls, \nthey would’ve had no filling. So, the word was actually \nconfusingly imprecise, but it stuck, nonetheless. When Japan occupied China \nduring the Second World War, Chinese “jiaozi” were brought to Japan, where they in turn became known as “gyoza”\nand were more typically pan-fried. So what about the fact that every region\nin Italy has its own variety of dumpling-like stuffed pasta? Some historians think that Arab conquerors\nbrought dumplings when they reigned over Sicily \nbetween the 9th and 11th centuries. But the jury's still out. It’s unlikely that all dumpling-esque\ndishes came from the same root tradition. In many cases, it may simply \nbe that culinary visionaries from different cultures shared \na similar revelation: that cooking fillings encased in dough \nwould be delightful. Either way, we can appreciate \nthese plump pockets of perfection— and the tangled, mysterious historical web that’s made dumplings \nso diverse and divine.

        "text": "In ancient Greece, violent internal\nconflict between bordering neighbors and war with foreign invaders\nwas a way of life, and Greeks were considered\npremier warriors. Most Greek city-states surrounded\nthemselves with massive defensive walls for added protection. Sparta in its prime was a different story, finding walls unnecessary when it had an army of the most feared\nwarriors in the ancient world. So what was Sparta doing differently\nthan everyone else to produce such fierce soldiers? To answer that question, we turn to\nthe written accounts of that time. There are no surviving written accounts\nfrom Spartans themselves, as it was forbidden for Spartans\nto keep records, so we have to rely on those of\nnon-Spartan ancient historians, like Herodotus, Thucydides,\nand Plutarch. These stories may be embellished and depict Sparta \nat the apex of its power, so take them with a grain of salt. For Spartans, the purpose for their\nexistence was simple: to serve Sparta. On the day of their birth, elder Spartan leaders examined\nevery newborn. The strong healthy babies were considered\ncapable of fulfilling this purpose, and the others may have been left\non Mount Taygetus to die. Every Spartan, boy or girl,\nwas expected to be physically strong, mentally sharp, and emotionally resilient. And it was their absolute duty\nto defend and promote Sparta at all costs. So in the first years of their lives, children were raised to understand that\ntheir loyalty belonged first to Sparta, and then to family. This mindset probably made it easier\nfor the Spartan boys, who upon turning seven,\nwere sent to the agoge, a place with one main purpose: to turn a boy into a Spartan warrior through thirteen years of relentless,\nharsh, and often brutal training. The Spartans prized physical perfection\nabove all else, and so the students spent a great deal\nof their time learning how to fight. To ensure resilience in battle, boys were encouraged to fight\namong themselves, and bullying, unlike today, \nwas acceptable. In order to better prepare the boys\nfor the conditions of war, the boys were poorly fed, sometimes even going days without eating. They also were given little \nin the way of clothing so that they could learn to deal\nwith different temperatures. Spartan boys were encouraged\nto steal in order to survive, but if they were caught, they would be disciplined, not because they stole,\nbut because they were caught in the act. During the annual contest of endurance in a religious ritual known as\nthe diamastigosis, teenage boys were whipped\nin front of an altar at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. It was common for boys to die\non the altar of the goddess. Fortunately, not everything\nwas as brutal as that. Young Spartans were also taught\nhow to read, write, and dance, which taught them graceful control\nof their movements and helped them in combat. While the responsibilities for the girls\nof Sparta were different, the high standards of excellence and expectation to serve \nSparta with their lives remained the same. Spartan girls lived at home with\ntheir mothers as they attended school. Their curriculum included the arts, music, dance, reading, and writing. And to stay in peak physical condition,\nthey learned a variety of sports, such as discus, javelin, and horseback riding. In Sparta, it was believed that only\nstrong and capable women could bear children that would one day\nbecome strong and capable warriors. To all Spartans, men and women, perhaps the most important lesson\nfrom Spartan school was allegiance to Sparta. To die for their city-state was seen\nas the completion of one's duty to Sparta. Upon their death, only men who died in battle\nand women who died in childbirth were given tombstones. In the eyes of their countrymen,\nboth died so that Sparta could live. "

        "text": "In the spring of 1944, Tokyo residents\nexperienced numerous aerial attacks from Allied bombers. Air raid sirens warned citizens \nto get indoors and preceded strategic blackouts\nacross the city. But 28-year old Hisako Koyama \nsaw these blackouts as opportunities. Dragging a futon over her head \nfor protection, Koyama would gaze at the night sky, tracking all sorts \nof astronomical phenomena. However, her latest endeavor required \nthe light of day. By angling her telescope towards the sun, Koyama could project the star's\nlight onto a sheet of paper, allowing her to sketch \nthe sun’s shifting surface. She spent weeks recreating this set up,\ntracking every change she saw. But while Koyama didn't know it, these drawings were the start \nof one of the most important records of solar activity in human history. To understand exactly what Koyama\nsaw on the sun’s surface, we first need to understand \nwhat’s happening inside the star. Every second, \ntrillions of hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms\nin a process called nuclear fusion. This ongoing explosion maintains \nthe sun’s internal temperature of roughly 15 million degrees Celsius, which is more than enough energy \nto transform gas into churning pools of plasma. Plasma consists of charged particles \nthat produce powerful magnetic fields. But unlike the stable charged particles \nthat maintain magnetic activity on Earth, this plasma is constantly in flux, alternately disrupting and amplifying\nthe sun's magnetic field. This ongoing movement can produce temporary concentrations \nof magnetic activity which inhibit the movement of molecules \nand in turn reduce heat in that area. And since regions with less heat \ngenerate less light, places with the strongest magnetic fields\nappear as dark spots scattered across the sun’s surface. These so-called sunspots \nare always moving, both as a result of plasma \nswirling within the sphere, and the sun’s rotation. And because they’re often \nclustered together, accurately counting sunspots and tracking \ntheir movement can be a challenge, depending greatly on the perception \nand judgment of the viewer. This is precisely where Koyama’s \ncontributions would be so valuable. Despite having no\nformal training in astronomy, her observations and sketches\nwere remarkably accurate. After sending her work \nto the Oriental Astronomical Association, she received a letter of commendation for\nher dedicated and detailed observations. With their support, she began to visit \nthe Tokyo Museum of Science, where she could use a far superior\ntelescope to continue her work. Koyama soon joined the museum's staff\nas a professional observer, and over the next 40 years, \nshe worked on a daily basis, producing over 10,000 drawings\nof the sun’s surface. Researchers already knew magnetic currents\nin the sun followed an 11 year cycle that moved sunspots in a butterfly shaped \npath over the star’s surface. But using Koyama’s record, they could precisely follow \nspecific sunspots and clusters through that journey. This kind of detail offered a real-time\nindication of the sun’s magnetic activity, allowing scientists to track \nall kinds of solar phenomena, including volatile solar flares. These flares typically emanate\nfrom the vicinity of sunspots, and can travel all the way \nto Earth’s atmosphere. Here, they can create geomagnetic storms capable of disrupting long range \ncommunication and causing blackouts. Solar flares also pose a major risk \nto satellites and manned space stations, making them essential to predict \nand plan for. During an interview in 1964, Koyama lamented that her 17 years \nof observation had barely been enough to produce a single butterfly record\nof the solar cycle. But by the end of her career, \nshe’d drawn three and a half cycles— one of the longest records ever made. Better still, the quality of her\ndrawings was so consistent, researchers used them as a baseline \nto reconstruct the past 400 years of sunspot activity\nfrom various historical sources. This project extends Koyama’s legacy\nfar beyond her own lifetime, and proves that science is not built\nsolely on astounding discoveries, but also on careful observation\nof the world around us. "

But you can find all of these foods\nout on the shelf at the grocery store, hopefully unspoiled, thanks to preservatives. But what exactly are preservatives? How do they help keep food edible\nand are they safe? There are two major factors that cause\nfood to go bad: microbes and oxidation. Microbes like bacteria and fungi\ninvade food and feed off its nutrients. Some of these can cause diseases, like listeria and botulism. Others just turn edibles into a smelly,\nslimy, moldy mess. Meanwhile, oxidation is a chemical change\nin the food's molecules caused by enzymes or free radicals\nwhich turn fats rancid and brown produce, \nlike apples and potatoes. Preservatives can prevent both types\nof deterioration. Before the invention of artificial\nrefrigeration, fungi and bacteria could \nrun rampant in food. So we found ways to create an inhospitable\nenvironment for microbes. For example, making the food more acidic\nunravels enzymes that microbes need to survive. And some types of bacteria \ncan actually help. For thousands of years, people preserved\nfood using bacteria that produce lactic acid. The acid turns perishable vegetables\nand milk into longer lasting foods, like sauerkraut in Europe, kimchi in Korea, and yogurt in the Middle East. These cultured foods also populate your\ndigestive track with beneficial microbes. Many synthetic preservatives \nare also acids. Benzoic acid in salad dressing, sorbic acid in cheese, and propionic acid in baked goods. Are they safe? Some studies suggest that benzoates,\nrelated to benzoic acid, contribute to hyperactive behavior. But the results aren't conclusive. Otherwise, these acids seem to be\nperfectly safe. Another antimicrobial strategy is to add\na lot of sugar, like in jam, or salt, like in salted meats. Sugar and salt hold on to water\nthat microbes need to grow and actually suck moisture out\nof any cells that may be hanging around, thus destroying them. Of course, too much sugar and salt\ncan increase your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, so these preservatives \nare best in moderation. Antimicrobial nitrates and nitrites,\noften found in cured meats, ward off the bacteria that cause botulism,\nbut they may cause other health problems. Some studies linking cured meats to cancer have suggested that these preservatives\nmay be the culprit. Meanwhile, antioxidant preservatives\nprevent the chemical changes that can give food an off-flavor or color. Smoke has been used to preserve food\nfor millennia because some of the aromatic compounds\nin wood smoke are antioxidants. Combining smoking with salting was an\neffective way of preserving meat before refrigeration. For antioxidant activity \nwithout a smoky flavor, there are compounds like BHT\nand tocopherol, better known as vitamin E. Like the compounds in smoke,\nthese sop up free radicals and stave off rancid flavors that can develop in foods like oils, cheese, and cereal. Other antioxidants like citric acid\nand ascorbic acid help cut produce keep its color by thwarting the enzyme \nthat causes browning. Some compounds \nlike sulfites can multitask. They're both antimicrobials\nand antioxidants. Sulfites may cause allergy symptoms\nin some people, but most antioxidant preservatives\nare generally recognized as safe. So should you be worried \nabout preservatives? Well, they're usually near the end\nof the ingredients list because they're used \nin very small amounts determined by the FDA to be safe. Nevertheless, some consumers\nand companies are trying to find alternatives. Packaging tricks, like reducing\nthe oxygen around the food can help, but without some kind \nof chemical assistance, there are very few foods that can\nstay shelf stable for long. "

        "text": "What happens after death? Is there a restful paradise? An eternal torment? A rebirth? Or maybe just nothingness? Well, one Chinese emperor thought\nthat whatever the hereafter was, he better bring an army. We know that because in 1974, farmers digging a well \nnear their small village stumbled upon one of the most important\nfinds in archeological history: vast underground chambers\nsurrounding that emperor's tomb, and containing more than 8,000\nlife-size clay soldiers ready for battle. The story of the subterranean army\nbegins with Ying Zheng, who came to power as the king\nof the Qin state at the age of 13 in 246 BCE. Ambitious and ruthless, he would go on to become\nQin Shi Huangdi, the first emperor of China\nafter uniting its seven warring kingdoms. His 36 year reign \nsaw many historic accomplishments, including a universal system\nof weights and measures, a single standardized writing script\nfor all of China, and a defensive barrier that would\nlater come to be known as the Great Wall. But perhaps Qin Shi Huangdi\ndedicated so much effort to securing his historical legacy because he was obsessed \nwith his mortality. He spent his last years\ndesperately employing alchemists and deploying expeditions\nin search of elixirs of life that would help him achieve immortality. And as early as the first year \nof his reign, he began the construction of a massive\nunderground necropolis filled with monuments, artifacts, and an army to accompany him\ninto the next world and continue his rule. This magnificent army is still standing\nin precise battle formation and is split across several pits. One contains a main force\nof 6,000 soldiers, each weighing several hundred pounds, a second has more than 130 war chariots\nand over 600 horses, and a third houses the high command. An empty fourth pit suggests\nthat the grand project could not be finished \nbefore the emperor's death. In addition, nearby chambers contain\nfigures of musicians and acrobats, workers and government officials, and various exotic animals, indicating that Emperor Qin\nhad more plans for the afterlife than simply waging war. All the figurines are sculpted\nfrom terracotta, or baked earth, a type of reddish brown clay. To construct them, multiple workshops\nand reportedly over 720,000 laborers were commandeered by the emperor, including groups of artisans who molded\neach body part separately to construct statues as individual as\nthe real warriors in the emperor's army. They stand according to rank and feature different weapons \nand uniforms, distinct hairstyles and expressions, and even unique ears. Originally, each warrior was painted\nin bright colors, but their exposure to air\ncaused the paint to dry and flake, leaving only the terracotta base. It is for this very reason that another\nchamber less than a mile away has not been excavated. This is the actual tomb of\nQin Shi Huangdi, reported to contain palaces,\nprecious stones and artifacts, and even rivers of mercury\nflowing through mountains of bronze. But until a way can be found to expose it\nwithout damaging the treasures inside, the tomb remains sealed. Emperor Qin was not alone in wanting\ncompany for his final destination. Ancient Egyptian tombs contain clay models\nrepresenting the ideal afterlife, the dead of Japan's Kofun \nperiod were buried with sculptures of horses and houses, and the graves of the Jaina island\noff the Mexican coast are full of ceramic figurines. Fortunately, as ruthless as he was, Emperor Qin chose to have servants\nand soldiers built for this purpose, rather than sacrificing living ones\nto accompany him, as had been practiced in Egypt,\nWest Africa, Anatolia, parts of North America and even China during \nthe previous Shang and Zhou dynasties.

        "text": "Are you afraid of black cats? Would you open an umbrella indoors? And how do you feel about \nthe number thirteen? Whether or not you believe in them, you're probably familiar with a few\nof these superstitions. So how did it happen that people\nall over the world knock on wood, or avoid stepping on sidewalk cracks? Well, although they have no basis\nin science, many of these weirdly specific beliefs\nand practices do have equally weird\nand specific origins. Because they involve supernatural causes, it's no surprise that many superstitions\nare based in religion. For example. the number thirteen was\nassociated with the biblical Last Supper, where Jesus Christ dined \nwith his twelve disciples just before being arrested and crucified. The resulting idea that having thirteen\npeople at a table was bad luck eventually expanded into thirteen\nbeing an unlucky number in general. Now, this fear of the number thirteen,\ncalled triskaidekaphobia, is so common that many buildings around \nthe world skip the thirteenth floor, with the numbers going straight from\ntwelve to fourteen. Of course, many people consider\nthe story of the Last Supper to be true but other superstitions come from \nreligious traditions that few people believe in\nor even remember. Knocking on wood is thought to come from \nthe folklore of the ancient Indo-Europeans or possibly people who predated them who believed that trees were home\nto various spirits. Touching a tree would invoke \nthe protection or blessing of the spirit within. And somehow, this tradition survived long after \nbelief in these spirits had faded away. Many superstitions common today\nin countries from Russia to Ireland are thought to be remnants of the pagan\nreligions that Christianity replaced. But not all superstitions are religious. Some are just based on unfortunate\ncoincidences and associations. For example, many Italians fear\nthe number 17 because the Roman numeral XVII\ncan be rearranged to form the word vixi, meaning my life had ended. Similarly, the word for the number four sounds almost identical \nto the word for death in Cantonese, as well as languages like Japanese and Korean that have borrowed \nChinese numerals. And since the number one also\nsounds like the word for must, the number fourteen sounds\nlike the phrase must die. That's a lot of numbers for elevators\nand international hotels to avoid. And believe it or not, some superstitions actually make sense, or at least they did until we \nforgot their original purpose. For example, theater scenery used to\nconsist of large painted backdrops, raised and lowered by stagehands\nwho would whistle to signal each other. Absentminded whistles from other people\ncould cause an accident. But the taboo against whistling backstage\nstill exists today, long after the stagehands started using\nradio headsets. Along the same lines, lighting three\ncigarettes from the same match really could cause bad luck\nif you were a soldier in a foxhole where keeping a match lit too long\ncould draw attention from an enemy sniper. Most smokers no longer have to worry\nabout snipers, but the superstition lives on. So why do people cling to these bits\nof forgotten religions, coincidences, and outdated advice? Aren't they being totally irrational? Well, yes, but for many people, superstitions are based more\non cultural habit than conscious belief. After all, no one is born knowing to avoid\nwalking under ladders or whistling indoors, but if you grow up being told\nby your family to avoid these things, chances are they'll make \nyou uncomfortable, even after you logically understand\nthat nothing bad will happen. And since doing something like knocking\non wood doesn't require much effort, following the superstition is often\neasier than consciously resisting it. Besides, superstitions \noften do seem to work. Maybe you remember hitting a home run\nwhile wearing your lucky socks. This is just our psychological \nbias at work. You're far less likely to remember \nall the times you struck out while wearing the same socks. But believing that they work\ncould actually make you play better by giving you the illusion of having\ngreater control over events. So in situations where that confidence\ncan make a difference, like sports, those crazy superstitions might not\nbe so crazy after all. "

It gets a bad rap, but the Underworld\nis actually a lovely place to “live.” It boasts historic charm and eccentric\nneighbors with eternal ties to the area. The community even has\nits own guard dog, Cerberus. Heel, boy! Oh. Sorry, I know that’s a sensitive spot. Anyway, with Cerberus, you get\nthree for the price of one! He’s just not a big fan of anyone leaving. And who would want to leave anyway? This is the Styx—\nit’s like the subterranean riviera. But you’ve been here before; it was the source of your almost\ncomplete invulnerability, of course! The Underworld also features\nfour other waterways: Acheron, the river of woe;\nCocytus, river of wailing; Lethe, river of oblivion; and Phlegethon, river of fire,\na great source of natural light. Now, on your left,\nyou’ll see the Mourning Fields, inhabited by souls tormented by love. Quite an attractive place, really, when you’re not in the throes\nof endless heartbreak. And without further ado: Elysium, the Underworld’s\nexclusive VIP section— and your permanent home. Here, you'll join the ranks\nof royalty and heroes. Cadmus over there once slayed a dragon! And Patroclus is around here somewhere,\nalong with lots of other friends and foes. I'll let you two get reacquainted soon, but our tour wouldn’t be complete\nwithout a quick whirl through the heart of Hades:\nTartarus. Tisiphone here guards the portal. She's one of the legendary Furies and is particularly passionate about\navenging murder. She never sleeps. So, if you need anything, just ask! Tartarus is reserved for a select\nfew who some might call the greatest sinners of all time. Take Ixion. He was once a king. When he didn’t pay his wedding dowry, his father-in-law, Deioneus,\nstole his horses to get even. In retaliation, Ixion pitched\nDeioneus into a pit of fire. Ixion was banished, but Zeus miraculously\ntook pity on him, and invited him to a Mount Olympian feast. There, however, it soon became clear\nthat the disgraced king was trying to seduce Zeus’s wife, Hera. So, Zeus contrived a trap: a fluffy cloud that resembled\nHera exactly. When Zeus had proof of Ixion having\nhis way with the cumulus, well, you could say it was all nimbus\nfrom there. That landed Ixion on the flaming wheel. Poor thing. Oh, and don’t mind Tantalus here. He was part of the first generation\nof mortals, enjoying privileges \nlike dining with the gods. Some say Tantalus stole ambrosia\nfrom Zeus, others that he doubted\nthe omniscience of the gods and cooked his own son into a stew\nto see if they would notice. Naturally, they did. And as eternal punishment,\nwhen Tantalus reaches for food, the branches grow taller. And when he stoops to quench his thirst,\nthe water recedes. And here we have the Danaids. At their father’s order, they beheaded\ntheir husbands on their wedding night. They must fill this basin with water. But, the trick is, their jars are cracked,\nso it always... just... leaks away. Oh, but don’t worry!\nNo leaky appliances for you. Finally, our last stop on the tour\nis one of our loveliest vistas. From here, you can see the hill where\nSisyphus pushes his boulder day after day, only for it to roll back down again— all for trying to cheat death.

        "text": "You're facing a giant bowl of energy packed Carbon Crunchies. One spoonful. Two. Three. Soon, you're powered up by the energy surge that comes from your meal. But how did that energy get into your bowl? Energy exists in the form of sugars made by the plant your cereal came from, like wheat or corn. As you can see, carbon is the chemical backbone, and plants get their fix of it in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2, from the air that we all breath. But how does a plant's energy factory, housed in the stroma of the chloroplast, turn a one carbon gas, like CO2, into a six carbon solid, like glucose? If you're thinking photosynthesis, you're right. But photosynthesis is divided into two steps. The first, which stores energy from the sun in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. And the second, the Calvin cycle, that captures carbon and turns it into sugar. This second phase represents one of nature's most sustainable production lines. And so with that, welcome to world's most miniscule factory. The starting materials? A mix of CO2 molecules from the air, and preassembled molecules called ribulose biphosphate, or RuBP, each containing five carbons. The initiator? An industrious enzyme named rubisco that welds one carbon atom from a CO2 molecule with the RuBP chain to build an initial six carbon sequence. That rapidly splits into two shorter chains containing three carbons each and called phosphoglycerates, or PGAs, for short. Enter ATP, and another chemical called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, or just NADPH. ATP, working like a lubricant, delivers energy, while NADPH affixes one hydrogen to each of the PGA chains, changing them into molecules called glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, or G3Ps. Glucose needs six carbons to form, made from two molecules of G3P, which incidentally have six carbons between them. So, sugar has just been manufactured, right? Not quite. The Calvin cycle works like a sustainable production line, meaning that those original RuBPs that kicked things off at the start, need to be recreated by reusing materials within the cycle now. But each RuBP needs five carbons and manufacturing glucose takes a whole six. Something doesn't add up. The answer lies in one phenomenal fact. While we've been focusing on this single production line, five others have been happening at the same time. With six conveyor belts moving in unison, there isn't just one carbon that gets soldered to one RuBP chain, but six carbons soldered to six RuBPs. That creates 12 G3P chains instead of just two, meaning that all together, 36 carbons exist: the precise number needed to manufacture sugar, and rebuild those RuBPs. Of the 12 G3Ps pooled together, two are siphoned off to form that energy rich six carbon glucose chain. The one fueling you via your breakfast. Success! But back on the manufacturing line, the byproducts of this sugar production are swiftly assembled to recreate those six RuBPs. That requires 30 carbons, the exact number contained by the remaining 10 G3PS. Now a molecular mix and match occurs. Two of the G3Ps are welded together forming a six carbon sequence. By adding a third G3P, a nine carbon chain is built. The first RuBP, made up of five carbons, is cast from this, leaving four carbons behind. But there's no wastage here. Those are soldered to a fourth G3P molecule, making a seven carbon chain. Added to a fifth G3P molecule, a ten carbon chain is created, enough now to craft two more RuBPs. With three full RuBPs recreated from five of the ten G3Ps, simply duplicating this process will renew the six RuBP chains needed to restart the cycle again. So the Calvin cycle generates the precise number of elements and processes required to keep this biochemical production line turning endlessly. And it's just one of the 100s of cycles present in nature. Why so many? Because if biological production processes were linear, they wouldn't be nearly as efficient or successful at using energy to manufacture the materials that nature relies upon, like sugar. Cycles create vital feedback loops that repeatedly reuse and rebuild ingredients crafting as much as possible out of the planet's available resources. Such as that sugar, built using raw sunlight and carbon converted in plant factories to become the energy that powers you and keeps the cycles revolving in your own life. "

        "text": "What keeps you up at night? Pondering deep questions? Excitement about a big trip? Or is it stress about unfinished work, an upcoming test, or a dreaded family gathering? For many people, this stress is temporary,\nas its cause is quickly resolved. But what if the very thing keeping \nyou awake was stress about losing sleep? This seemingly unsolvable loop \nis at the heart of insomnia, the world’s most common\nsleep disorder. Almost anything can cause \nthe occasional restless night - a snoring partner, physical pain, or emotional distress. And extreme sleep deprivation like jetlag\ncan throw off your biological clock, wreaking havoc on your sleep schedule. But in most cases, sleep deprivation \nis short-term. Eventually, exhaustion catches up \nwith all of us. However, some long-term conditions\nlike respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and many others can overpower fatigue. And as sleepless nights pile up, the bedroom can start to carry \nassociations of restless nights wracked with anxiety. Come bedtime, insomniacs are stressed. So stressed their brains hijack \nthe stress response system, flooding the body with \nfight-flight-or-freeze chemicals. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones \ncourse through the bloodstream, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and jolting the body into hyperarousal. In this condition, the brain is hunting \nfor potential threats, making it impossible to ignore\nany slight discomfort or nighttime noise. And when insomniacs \nfinally do fall asleep, the quality of their rest is compromised. Our brain’s primary source of energy \nis cerebral glucose, and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows\nto conserve this glucose for waking hours. But PET studies show the adrenaline \nthat prevents sleep for insomniacs also speeds up their metabolisms. While they sleep, their bodies \nare working overtime, burning through the brain’s supply \nof energy-giving glucose. This symptom of poor sleep leaves \ninsomniacs waking in a state of exhaustion,\nconfusion, and stress, which starts the\nprocess all over again. When these cycles of stress \nand restlessness last several months, they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia. And while insomnia rarely leads to death, its chemical mechanisms are similar \nto anxiety attacks found in those experiencing depression\nand anxiety. So suffering from \nany one of these conditions increases your risk of\nexperiencing the other two. Fortunately, there are ways to break \nthe cycle of sleeplessness. Managing the stress that leads \nto hyperarousal is one of our best-understood treatments \nfor insomnia, and good sleep practices can help rebuild \nyour relationship with bedtime. Make sure your bedroom is dark \nand comfortably cool to minimize “threats” during hyperarousal. Only use your bed for sleeping, and if you’re restless, leave the room and tire yourself out \nwith relaxing activities like reading, meditating, or journaling. Regulate your metabolism by setting\nconsistent resting and waking times to help orient \nyour body’s biological clock. This clock, or circadian rhythm, is also sensitive to light, so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body\nthat it’s time for sleep. In addition to these practices, some doctors prescribe medication \nto aid sleep, but there aren’t reliable medications \nthat help in all cases. And over-the-counter sleeping pills \ncan be highly addictive, leading to withdrawal \nthat worsens symptoms. But before seeking any treatment, make sure your sleeplessness \nis actually due to insomnia. Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed \nwith chronic insomnia are actually suffering from a less common\ngenetic problem called delayed sleep phase disorder,\nor DSPD. People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm \nsignificantly longer than 24 hours, putting their sleeping habits out \nof sync with traditional sleeping hours. So while they have difficulty \nfalling asleep at a typical bedtime, it’s not due to increased stress. And given the opportunity, they can sleep comfortably \non their own delayed schedule. Our sleeping and waking cycle \nis a delicate balance, and one that’s vital to maintain\nfor our physical and mental wellbeing. For all these reasons, it’s worth putting in some time \nand effort to sustain a stable bedtime routine, but try not to lose any sleep over it. "

        "text": "Trillions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi\nlive on or inside of us, and maintaining a good, balanced \nrelationship with them is to our advantage. Together, they form the gut microbiome, a rich ecosystem that performs a variety\nof functions in our bodies. The bacteria in our guts\ncan break down food the body can't digest, produce important nutrients, regulate the immune system, and protect against harmful germs. We don't yet have the blueprint for exactly which good bacteria \na robust gut needs, but we do know that it's important\nfor a healthy microbiome to have a variety of bacterial species. Many factors affect our microbiomes, including our environment, medications like antibiotics, and even whether we were delivered\nby C-section or not. Diet, too, is emerging as one \nof the leading influences on the health of our guts. And while we can't control all \nthese factors, we can manipulate the balance\nof our microbes by paying attention to what we eat. Dietary fiber from foods like fruits, \nvegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains is the best fuel for gut bacteria. When bacteria digest fiber, they produce short chain fatty acids\nthat nourish the gut barrier, improve immune function, and can help prevent inflammation,\nwhich reduces the risk of cancer. And the more fiber you ingest, the more fiber-digesting bacteria\ncolonize your gut. In a recent study, scientists exchanged\nthe regular high-fiber diets of a group of rural South Africans with the high-fat, meat-heavy diets\nof a group of African-Americans. After just two weeks on the high-fat,\nlow-fiber, Western-style diet, the rural African group showed\nincreased inflammation of the colon, as well as a decrease of butyrate. That's a short chain fatty acid thought\nto lower risk of colon cancer. Meanwhile, the group that switched\nto a high-fiber, low-fat diet had the opposite result. So what goes wrong with our gut bacteria \nwhen we eat low-fiber processed foods? Lower fiber means less fuel\nfor the gut bacteria, essentially starving them \nuntil they die off. This results in less diversity and hungry bacteria. In fact, some can even start to feed\non the mucus lining. We also know that specific foods \ncan affect gut bacteria. In one recent microbiome study, scientists found that fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, red wine, and dark chocolate were correlated with \nincreased bacterial diversity. These foods contain polyphenols, which are naturally occurring \nantioxidant compounds. On the other hand, foods high in dairy fat, like whole milk, and sugar-sweetened sodas were correlated with decreased diversity. How food is prepared also matters. Minimally processed, fresh foods\ngenerally have more fiber and provide better fuel. So lightly steamed, sautéed, or raw vegetables are typically more beneficial\nthan fried dishes. There are also ways of preparing food\nthat can actually introduce good bacteria, also known as probiotics,\ninto your gut. Fermented foods are teeming\nwith helpful probiotic bacteria, like lactobacillus and bifidobacteria. Originally used as a way \nof preserving foods before the invention of refrigeration, fermentation remains a traditional\npractice all over the world. Foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, and kombucha provide variety and vitality\nto our diets. Yogurt is another fermented food that can\nintroduce helpful bacteria into our guts. That doesn't necessarily mean that\nall yogurt is good for us, though. Brands with too much sugar\nand not enough bacteria may not actually help. These are just general guidelines. More research is needed before \nwe fully understand exactly how any of these foods\ninteract with our microbiomes. We see positive correlations, but the insides of our guts are difficult\nplaces to make direct observations. For instance, we don't currently know whether these foods are directly\nresponsible for the changes in diversity, or if something more complicated\nis happening. While we're only beginning to explore\nthe vast wilderness inside our guts, we already have a glimpse of how crucial\nour microbiomes are for digestive health. The great news is we have the power\nto fire up the bacteria in our bellies. Fill up on fibers, fresh and fermented foods, and you can trust your gut\nto keep you going strong. "

King Arthur has risen again \nand again in our collective imagination, along with his retinue of knights, Guinevere, the Round Table, Camelot, and of course, Excalibur. But where do these stories come from,\nand is there any truth to them? King Arthur as we know him \nis a creation of the later Middle Ages, but his legend actually has its roots \nin Celtic poetry from an earlier time: the Saxon invasions of Britain. After the Romans left Britain in 410 CE, Saxon invaders from \nwhat’s now Germany and Denmark quickly capitalized on the vulnerability \nof the abandoned territory. The inhabitants of Britain fought \nfiercely against the invaders through several centuries of turmoil. There are hardly any written records \nfrom this time, so it’s difficult to reconstruct \nan accurate history. However, surviving poetry from the era\ngives us some clues. One of the poems, The Gododdin, contains\nthe very first reference to Arthur, though Arthur himself \ndoesn’t actually appear in it. It says a different warrior,\nnamed Gwawrddur, was skilled at slaying his enemies, \nbut was no Arthur. That’s not much to go on, but whoever this Arthur was, he must’ve been \nthe gold standard of warriors. Whether he ruled anyone, or even lived \nat all is, unfortunately, less clear. Despite this uncertainty, references to Arthur caught \nthe attention of an aspiring historian hundreds of years later. In 1130, Geoffrey of Monmouth \nwas a lowly cleric with grand ambitions. Using Celtic and Latin sources, he spent years creating \na lengthy chronicle titled, \"The History \nof the Kings of Britain.\" The centerpiece \nof this tome was King Arthur. History is a generous term \nfor Geoffrey’s account. Writing six hundred years after \nthe Saxon invasions, he cobbled together fragments \nof myth and poetry to compensate for the almost \ncomplete lack of official records. A few of his sources contained \nmentions of Arthur, and some others were realistic accounts \nof battles and places. But many featured mythic heroes \nfighting long odds with the help of magical swords \nand sorcery. Geoffrey blended them all: A magical sword called Caledfwlch and a Roman fortress called Caerleon \nappeared in his source material, so Geoffrey’s Arthur ruled from Caerleon\nand wielded Caliburnus, the Latin translation of Caledfwlch. Geoffrey even added a wise\ncounselor named Merlin, based on the Celtic bard Myrrdin, \nto Arthur’s story. If Arthur did live, he would likely \nhave been a military leader, but a castle-bound king better fit\nGeoffrey’s regal history. Geoffrey’s chronicle got the attention \nhe’d hoped for, and was soon translated from Latin\ninto French by the poet Wace around 1155 CE. Wace added another centerpiece of\nArthurian lore to Geoffrey’s sword, castle, and wizard: the Round Table. He wrote that Arthur \nhad the table constructed so that all guests in his court \nwould be equally placed, and none could boast that he had \nthe highest position at the table. After reading Wace’s translation, \nanother French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, wrote a series of romances \nthat catapulted Arthur’s story to fame. He introduced tales of individual knights \nlike Lancelot and Gawain, and mixed elements of romance \nin with the adventures. He conceived Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere’s love triangle. In addition to interpersonal intrigue,\nhe also introduced the Holy Grail. Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers\non magical objects in Celtic mythology. He lived in the middle of the Crusades, and others imposed the preoccupations \nof the time on the Grail, casting it as a powerful relic \nfrom the crucifixion. Numerous adaptations in French \nand other languages followed from Chrétien’s work. In the course of these retellings,\nCaerleon became Camelot, and Caliburnus \nwas rechristened Excalibur. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory synthesized \nthese stories in Le Morte D’arthur, the basis of many modern accounts \nof King Arthur. In the thousand years since Arthur \nfirst appeared in a Celtic poem, his story has transformed over \nand over to reflect the concerns of his chroniclers\nand their audiences. And we’re still rewriting \nand adapting the legend today. Whether or not the man ever lived, loved, reigned, or adventured, it’s undeniable that the character \nhas achieved immortality. "

        "text": "Today when people complain about the state of American politics, they often mention the dominance of the Democratic and Republican Parties, or the sharp split between red and blue states. But while it may seem like both of these things have been around forever, the situation looked quite different in 1850, with the Republican Party not yet existing, and support for the dominant Democrats and Whigs cutting across geographic divides. The collapse of this Second Party System was at the center of increasing regional tensions that would lead to the birth of the Republican Party, the rise of Abraham Lincoln as its leader, and a civil war that would claim over half a million lives. And if this collapse could be blamed on a single event, it would be the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. The story starts with the Missouri Compromise of 1820. To balance the number of slave states and free states in the Union, it allowed slavery in the newly admitted state of Missouri, while making it off limits in the remaining federally administered Louisiana Territory. But compromises tend to last only as long as they're convenient, and by the early 1850s, a tenacious Democratic Senator from Illionis named Stephen A. Douglas found its terms very inconvenient. As an advocate of western expansion, he promoted constructing a transcontinental railroad across the Northern Plains with an eastern terminus in Chicago, where he happened to own real estate. For his proposal to succeed, Douglas felt that the territories through which the railroad passed, would have to be formally organized, which required the support of Southern politicians. He was also a believer in popular sovereignty, arguing that the status of slavery in a territory should be decided by its residents rather than Congress. So Douglas introduced a bill designed to kill two birds with one stone. It would divide the large chunk of incorporated land into two new organized territories: Nebraska and Kansas, each of which would be open to slavery if the population voted to allow it. While Douglas and his Southern supporters tried to frame the bill as protecting the political rights of settlers, horrified Northerners recognized it as repealing the 34-year-old Missouri Compromise and feared that its supporters' ultimate goal was to extend slavery to the entire nation. Congress was able to pass the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but at the huge cost of bitterly dividing the nation, with 91% of the opposition coming from Northerners. In the House of Representatives, politicians traded insults and brandished weapons until a Sargent at Arms restored order. President Pierce signed the bill into law amidst a storm of protest, while Georgia's Alexander Stephens, future Confederate Vice President, hailed the Act's passage as, \"Glory enough for one day.\" The New York Tribune reported, \"The unanimous sentiment of the North is indignant resistance.\" Douglas even admitted that he could travel from Washington D.C. to Chicago by the light of his own burning effigies. The political consequences of the Kansas-Nebraska Act were stunning. Previously, both Whigs and Democrats had included Northern and Southern lawmakers united around various issues, but now slavery became a dividing factor that could not be ignored. Congressmen from both parties spoke out against the act, including an Illinois Whig named Abraham Lincoln, denouncing \"the monstrous injustice of slavery\" in an 1854 speech. By this time the Whigs had all but ceased to exist, irreparably split between their Northern and Southern factions. In the same year, the new Republican Party was founded by the anti-slavery elements from both existing parties. Although Lincoln still ran for Senate as a Whig in 1854, he was an early supporter of the new party, and helped to recruit others to its cause. Meanwhile the Democratic Party was shaken when events in the newly formed Kansas Territory revealed the violent consequences of popular sovereignty. Advertisements appeared across the North imploring people to emigrate to Kansas to stem the advance of slavery. The South answered with Border Ruffians, pro-slavery Missourians who crossed state lines to vote in fraudulent elections and raid anti-slavery settlements. One northern abolitionist, John Brown, became notorious following the Pottawatomie Massacre of 1856 when he and his sons hacked to death five pro-slavery farmers with broad swords. In the end, more than 50 people died in Bleeding Kansas. While nominally still a national party, Douglas's Democrats were increasingly divided along sectional lines, and many Northern members left to join the Republicans. Abraham Lincoln finally took up the Republican Party banner in 1856 and never looked back. That year, John C. Fremont, the first Republican presidential candidate, lost to Democrat, James Buchanan, but garnered 33% of the popular vote all from Northern states. Two years later, Lincoln challenged Douglas for his Illinois Senate seat, and although he lost that contest, it elevated his status among Republicans. Lincoln would finally be vindicated in 1860, when he was elected President of the United States, defeating in his own home state, a certain Northern Democrat, who was finally undone by the disastrous aftermath of the law he had masterminded. Americans today continue to debate whether the Civil War was inevitable, but there is no doubt that the Kansas-Nebraska Act made the ghastly conflict much more likely. And for that reason, it should be remembered as one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in American history. "

        "text": "Before he turned physics upside down, a young Albert Einstein supposedly\nshowed off his genius by devising a complex riddle involving\nthis list of clues. Can you resist tackling a brain teaser written by one of the smartest \npeople in history? Let's give it a shot. The world's rarest fish has been\nstolen from the city aquarium. The police have followed the scent to a\nstreet with five identical looking houses. But they can't search \nall the houses at once, and if they pick the wrong one,\nthe thief will know they're on his trail. It's up to you, the city's best detective,\nto solve the case. When you arrive on the scene,\nthe police tell you what they know. One: each house's owner \nis of a different nationality, drinks a different beverage, and smokes a different type of cigar. Two: each house's interior walls\nare painted a different color. Three: each house contains a different animal,\none of which is the fish. After a few hours of expert sleuthing,\nyou gather some clues. It may look like a lot of information, but there's a clear logical path\nto the solution. Solving the puzzle will be\na lot like Sudoku, so you may find it helpful to organize\nyour information in a grid, like this. Pause the video on the following screen to\nexamine your clues and solve the riddle. Answer in: 3 2 1 To start, you fill in the information\nfrom clues eight and nine. Immediately, you also realize that since\nthe Norwegian is at the end of the street, there's only one house next to him, which must be the one with the blue walls\nin clue fourteen. Clue five says the green-walled\nhouse's owner drinks coffee. It can't be the center house since you\nalready know its owner drinks milk, but it also can't be the second house,\nwhich you know has blue walls. And since clue four says the green-walled house must be directly\nto the left of the white-walled one, it can't be the first \nor fifth house either. The only place left \nfor the green-walled house with the coffee drinker\nis the fourth spot, meaning the white-walled house\nis the fifth. Clue one gives you \na nationality and a color. Since the only column missing both\nthese values is the center one, this must be the Brit's red-walled home. Now that the only unassigned \nwall color is yellow, this must be applied to the first house, where clue seven says \nthe Dunhill smoker lives. And clue eleven tells you that\nthe owner of the horse is next door, which can only be the second house. The next step is to figure out what\nthe Norwegian in the first house drinks. It can't be tea, clue three tells you\nthat's the Dane. As per clue twelve, it can't be root beer\nsince that person smokes Bluemaster, and since you already \nassigned milk and coffee, it must be water. From clue fifteen, you know that the Norwegian's neighbor,\nwho can only be in the second house, smokes Blends. Now that the only spot in the grid\nwithout a cigar and a drink is in the fifth column, that must be the home of the person\nin clue twelve. And since this leaves only the second\nhouse without a drink, the tea-drinking Dane must live there. The fourth house is now the only one\nmissing a nationality and a cigar brand, so the Prince-smoking German\nfrom clue thirteen must live there. Through elimination, you can conclude\nthat the Brit smokes Pall Mall and the Swede lives in the fifth house, while clue six and clue two tell you that these two have a bird \nand a dog, respectively. Clue ten tells you that the cat owner\nlives next to the Blend-smoking Dane, putting him in the first house. Now with only one spot left on the grid, you know that the German in the \ngreen-walled house must be the culprit. You and the police burst into the house, catching the thief fish-handed. While that explanation \nwas straightforward, solving puzzles like this often\ninvolves false starts and dead ends. Part of the trick is to use \nthe process of elimination and lots of trial and error\nto hone in on the right pieces, and the more logic puzzles you solve, the better your intuition will be for when and where there's enough \ninformation to make your deductions. And did young Einstein \nreally write this puzzle? Probably not. There's no evidence he did, and some of the brands mentioned\nare too recent. But the logic here is not so different from what you'd use to solve equations\nwith multiple variables, even those describing \nthe nature of the universe. "

        "text": "Whether she’s describing \nbickering families, quiet declarations of love, or juicy gossip, Jane Austen’s writing often feels as \nthough it was written just for you. Her dry wit and cheeky playfulness \ninforms her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers\nwith a conspiratorial wink. It’s even been said that some readers \nfeel like the author’s secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully \nwicked friend Jane. But this unique brand of \ntongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the many feats found \nin her sly satires of society, civility, \nand sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth century, Austen's novels decode \nthe sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England. From resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her work explores the bewildering \ncollision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a common \nthread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style \nof writing so popular at the time. Instead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally, \nand often awkwardly. They trade pragmatic advice, \nfriendly jokes and not-so-friendly barbs \nabout their arrogant peers. As they grapple with the endless rules \nof their society, Austen’s characters can usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety, \nand small talk. As Mr. Bennet jokes \nto his favorite daughter, “For what do we live, \nbut to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?” And though her heroines might ridicule \nsenseless social mores, Austen fully understood the practical \nimportance of maintaining appearances. At the time she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial \nnecessity for most young women, and she often explores the tension between\nthe mythical quest for love, and the economic benefits \nof making a match. The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums \nthis up in \"Mansfield Park;\" “I would have everybody marry \nif they can do it properly: I do not like to have people \nthrow themselves away.” Unsurprisingly, these themes were also \npresent in Austen’s personal life. Born in 1775, she lived in the social circles \nfound in her novels. Jane's parents supported her education, and provided space for her to write \nand publish her work anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. And although she had sparks of chemistry, she never married. Elements of her circumstances can be found\nin many of her characters; often intelligent women with witty, \npragmatic personalities, and rich inner lives. These headstrong heroines provide \nan entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narratives. Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet \nof \"Pride and Prejudice,\" whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives \nblinds her to a clumsy suitor. Or the iron-willed Anne Elliot \nof \"Persuasion,\" who chooses to remain unmarried \nafter the disappearance of her first love. And Elinor Dashwood, who fiercely protects her family \nat the cost of her own desires in \"Sense and Sensibility.\" These women all encounter \ndifficult choices about romantic, filial, and \nfinancial stability, and they resolve them without \nsacrificing their values– or their sense of humor. Of course, these characters \nare far from perfect. They often think they have \nall the answers. And by telling the story \nfrom their perspective, Austen tricks the viewer into believing \ntheir heroine knows best– only to pull the rug out from under \nthe protagonist and the reader. In \"Emma,\" the titular character feels \nsurrounded by dull neighbors, and friends who can’t hope \nto match her wit. As her guests prattle on and \non about nothing, the reader begins to agree– Emma is the only exciting character \nin this quiet neighborhood. Yet despite her swelling ego, Emma may not be as in control \nas she thinks – in life or love. And Austen’s intimate use of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising, blindsiding both Emma and her audience. But rather than diminishing \nher host of heroines, these flaws only confirm “the \ninconsistency of all human characters.” Their complexity has kept Austen \nprominent on stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable \nfor modern sensibilities. So hopefully, new readers will continue \nto find a friend in Ms. Austen for many years to come. "

Fionn Mac Cumhaill, leader of the Fianna, Ireland’s most celebrated band \nof warriors, had just arrived at her castle. Gráinne had believed she was betrothed\nto a young soldier, bold and brilliant enough to be her equal. Yet upon their arrival, it became clear\nshe was expected to marry Fionn himself; who, while once a legend, \nwas far past his prime. Gráinne would not suffer this insult. Before the wedding,\nthe King held a great banquet. As the warriors told tales of Fionn’s\nstrength and magical healing hands, Gráinne waited to enact her revenge. But while scanning the room, her eyes\nlocked on to one of the guests. Diarmuid, one of Fionn’s bravest soldiers and foster child \nof the God of Love himself, was renowned for his stunning beauty. Perhaps this was the bold warrior\nthe princess had imagined? Only one way to find out. Gráinne swept into action, slipping a sleeping draught \ninto the partygoers’ goblets. Soon the hall fell silent—\nsave for two unenchanted guests. The pair immediately felt a powerful\nconnection. But Diarmuid hesitated. He’d never put his interests\nbefore the Fianna’s. Seeing Diarmuid waver \nbetween duty and desire, Gráinne took the decision \nout of his hands. With a light kiss, \nshe placed a geas on his brow— an ancient spell that bound them together,\nfor better or worse. As the pair escaped,\nDiarmuid’s heart was racing. Had he really betrayed Fionn \nfor a woman he’d just met? To answer his son’s questions, \nAngus Óg appeared beside them. The God of Love blessed their union\nand eased his son’s concern. But he also warned that endless\ndifficulties lay ahead. At the palace, Fionn awoke full of wrath. He rallied an epic war band that quickly\ncaught up to the lovers. To buy time, Diarmuid and Gráinne conjured\na massive enclosure with seven doors. While Gráinne escaped with Angus Óg,\nDiarmuid went door to door seeking Fionn. Some of the Fianna sought peaceful\nsurrender, others itched for combat. Diarmuid gave neither. But when he finally heard his leader’s \nvoice calling for blood, he knew there was no turning back. Launching himself over the barricade,\nDiarmuid leapt to Gráinne’s side. The chase was on. The pair ventured west, where they soon \nencountered the giant Modan. Eager to help the lovers, he guarded \nthem at night and carried them by day. And once the pair had crossed\ncountless rivers and hills, their fear began to ease. They left the forest’s cover, laughing, \nflirting, and growing bolder each day. But Fionn saw their contentment\nwas an opportunity. He enlisted three sea chiefs \nto capture the wandering lovers. Diarmuid scared them \noff with mystifying sword tricks— only for Fionn to send poisonous hounds. Diarmuid and Gráinne fled yet again \ninto an even more tangled forest— a sight which filled the Fianna\nwith exhaustion. They implored Fionn to give up the hunt,\nand at this, their leader grew quiet. He’d already lost a dear friend— now it seemed his wrath had cost him\nthe respect of his men as well. Swallowing his rage, \nhe called off the chase. For years, Gráinne and Diarmuid\nlived in peace. In time, Angus Óg even brokered \nan agreement between the warriors, and their conflict faded into memory. But Gráinne never forgot \nthe love god’s warning. One day, Fionn invited Diarmuid \non a boar hunt high in the mountains. While the two were riding,\na venomous boar charged them and mortally wounded Diarmuid. As he bled, the old warrior begged \nhis friend for water, as all the Fianna knew drinking \nfrom the hands of Fionn Mac Cumhaill could save their lives. But as Fionn turned to aid Diarmuid,\nhis old resentments came rushing back. For just a moment, his fingers parted,\nletting the water trickle to the ground. And by the time Fionn realized \nhis mistake, it was too late. And the embers of rage that long burned\ninside him were finally quenched by tears. "

        "text": "Which of these three people \nis doing something risky? Is it the one who takes their cholesterol \nmedication with grapefruit juice? The one who takes Acetaminophen pain \nrelievers for a sore ankle before \ngoing out for drinks? Or the one who’s on a blood-thinning \nmedication and takes an aspirin for a headache? Actually, all of them are. Each has inadvertently created a drug \ninteraction that could, in extreme cases, lead to kidney failure; liver damage; or internal bleeding. Drug interactions happen when the combination of a drug \nwith another substance causes different effects than either \nwould individually. Foods, herbal supplements, legal drugs, \nand illicit substances can all cause drug interactions. Most drug interactions\nfall into two categories. Some take place when two substances’ \neffects influence each other directly. In other cases, one substance effects \nhow the body processes another, like how it is absorbed, metabolized, \nor transported around the body. Blood thinners and aspirin, for example, have similar effects that become \ndangerous when combined. Both prevent blood clots from forming— blood thinners by preventing the formation\nof the clotting factors that hold clots together, and aspirin by preventing blood cells \nfrom clumping into groups that become clots. Individually, these effects \nare usually safe, but taken together, they can prevent blood\nclotting to a dangerous extent, possibly causing internal bleeding. While blood thinners and aspirin are \ngenerally harmless when taken individually, interactions where one substance \nexacerbates the effects of another can also take place between drugs that\nare independently harmful. Cocaine and heroin are each dangerous, and those dangers compound when the \ntwo drugs are combined— even though their behavioral effects may \nfeel like they cancel each other out. Cocaine is a stimulant, and many of its \neffects, like increased heart rate, cause the body to need more oxygen. But heroin, a depressant, \nslows breathing— reducing the body’s oxygen supply just \nwhen it needs more. This combination strains the organs and \ncan cause respiratory failure and death. The interaction between grapefruit juice \nand certain medications in class of cholesterol-lowering drugs \ncalled statins, has to do with drug metabolism. The liver produces enzymes, molecules that\nfacilitate the breakdown of substances that enter the body. Enzymes can both activate drugs, by breaking them down into their \ntherapeutic ingredients from more complex molecules, \nand deactivate them, by breaking harmful compounds down \ninto harmless metabolites. There are many, many different enzymes, each of which has a binding site that \nfits a specific molecule. Grapefruit binds to the same enzyme \nas statins, making less of that enzyme available \nto break down statins. So combining the two means that a \ngreater concentration of the drug stays in the bloodstream for a longer \nperiod of time, potentially causing kidney failure. Alcohol can also alter the function of the\nenzyme that breaks down Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in pain relievers \nlike Tylenol and paracetamol. When someone takes Acetaminophen, some\nof it is converted into a toxic substance. At the recommended dose, there isn’t usually enough of this toxic \nbyproduct to cause harm. But heavy drinking can alter enzyme \nactivity so more of that byproduct is produced, potentially causing liver damage even with what’s usually a safe dose of \nacetominophen. Meanwhile, the herbal remedy Saint John’s\nWort increases the liver’s production of a particular enzyme. That means the drugs this enzyme is \nresponsible for breaking down get metabolized faster— sometimes too fast, before they can \nhave their therapeutic effects. In spite of the dizzying number of \npossible interactions, most of the dangerous interactions \nwith commonly used drugs are well known. And new developments in science are \nhelping us keep better track of drug interactions than ever. Some researchers are developing AI \nprograms that can predict the side effects of drug interactions before they occur, using information about the landscape \nof protein interactions within your body. For the new drugs that are being developed\nall the time, supercomputers are being used to find \npotential interactions while those drugs \nare still in development. "

        "text": "In the biblical story \nof the Tower of Babel, all of humanity once spoke \na single language until they suddenly split\ninto many groups unable to understand each other. We don't really know if \nsuch an original language ever existed, but we do know that the thousands \nof languages existing today can be traced back \nto a much smaller number. So how did we end up with so many? In the early days of human migration, the world was much less populated. Groups of people that shared\na single language and culture often split into smaller tribes, going separate ways in search \nof fresh game and fertile land. As they migrated and \nsettled in new places, they became isolated from one another and developed in different ways. Centuries of living \nin different conditions, eating different food and encountering different neighbors turned similar dialects with\nvaried pronunciation and vocabulary into radically different languages, continuing to divide as populations \ngrew and spread out further. Like genealogists, modern linguists\ntry to map this process by tracing multiple languages \nback as far as they can to their common ancestor, \nor protolanguage. A group of all languages related \nin this way is called a language family, which can contain \nmany branches and sub-families. So how do we determine whether \nlanguages are related in the first place? Similar sounding words don't tell us much. They could be false cognates \nor just directly borrowed terms rather than derived from a common root. Grammar and syntax are \na more reliable guide, as well as basic vocabulary, such as pronouns, \nnumbers or kinship terms, that's less likely to be borrowed. By systematically comparing these features and looking for regular\npatterns of sound changes and correspondences between languages, linguists can determine relationships, trace specific steps in their evolution and even reconstruct earlier languages\nwith no written records. Linguistics can even reveal \nother important historical clues, such as determining the geographic origins \nand lifestyles of ancient peoples based on which of their words were native, and which were borrowed. There are two main problems linguists face when constructing \nthese language family trees. One is that there is \nno clear way of deciding where the branches \nat the bottom should end, that is, which dialects should be considered \nseparate languages or vice versa. Chinese is classified as a single language, but its dialects vary to the point\nof being mutually unintelligible, while speakers of Spanish and Portuguese can often understand each other. Languages actually spoken by living people do not exist in neatly divided categories, but tend to transition gradually, crossing borders and classifications. Often the difference between\nlanguages and dialects is a matter of changing political \nand national considerations, rather than any linguistic features. This is why the answer to, \n\"How many languages are there?\" can be anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000, depending on who's counting. The other problem is that \nthe farther we move back in time towards the top of the tree, the less evidence we have \nabout the languages there. The current division \nof major language families represents the limit at which \nrelationships can be established with reasonable certainty, meaning that languages \nof different families are presumed not to be related\non any level. But this may change. While many proposals \nfor higher level relationships -- or super families -- are speculative, some have been widely accepted and others are being considered, especially for native languages \nwith small speaker populations that have not been extensively studied. We may never be able to determine \nhow language came about, or whether all human languages \ndid in fact have a common ancestor scattered through the babel of migration. But the next time you hear \na foreign language, pay attention. It may not be as foreign as you think. "

        "text": "In 2011, a group of researchers conducted\na scientific study to find an impossible result: that listening to certain songs \ncan make you younger. Their study involved real people,\ntruthfully reported data, and commonplace statistical analyses. So how did they do it? The answer lies in a statistical method \nscientists often use to try to figure out whether their results\nmean something or if they’re random noise. In fact, the whole point \nof the music study was to point out ways\nthis method can be misused. A famous thought experiment\nexplains the method: there are eight cups of tea, four with the milk added first,\nand four with the tea added first. A participant must determine\nwhich are which according to taste. There are 70 different ways the cups \ncan be sorted into two groups of four, and only one is correct. So, can she taste the difference? That’s our research question. To analyze her choices, we define \nwhat’s called a null hypothesis: that she can’t distinguish the teas. If she can’t distinguish the teas, she’ll still get the right answer \n1 in 70 times by chance. 1 in 70 is roughly .014. That single number is called a p-value. In many fields, a p-value of .05 or below \nis considered statistically significant, meaning there’s enough evidence to reject\nthe null hypothesis. Based on a p-value of .014, they’d rule out the null hypothesis\nthat she can’t distinguish the teas. Though p-values are commonly\nused by both researchers and journals to evaluate scientific results, they’re really confusing, \neven for many scientists. That’s partly because all a p-value \nactually tells us is the probability of getting \na certain result, assuming the null hypothesis is true. So if she correctly sorts the teas, the p-value is the probability \nof her doing so assuming she can’t tell the difference. But the reverse isn’t true: the p-value doesn’t tell us \nthe probability that she can taste the difference, which is what we’re trying to find out. So if a p-value doesn’t answer\nthe research question, why does the scientific community use it? Well, because even though a p-value\ndoesn’t directly state the probability that the results are due to random chance, it usually gives a pretty\nreliable indication. At least, it does when used correctly. And that’s where many researchers, \nand even whole fields, have run into trouble. Most real studies are more complex\nthan the tea experiment. Scientists can test their research\nquestion in multiple ways, and some of these tests might produce\na statistically significant result, while others don’t. It might seem like a good idea \nto test every possibility. But it’s not, \nbecause with each additional test, the chance of a false positive increases. Searching for a low p-value, \nand then presenting only that analysis, is often called p-hacking. It’s like throwing darts \nuntil you hit a bullseye and then saying you only threw the dart \nthat hit the bull’s eye. This is exactly what the\nmusic researchers did. They played three groups of participants \neach a different song and collected lots of information \nabout them. The analysis they published included only\ntwo out of the three groups. Of all the information they collected, their analysis only used \nparticipants’ fathers’ age— to “control for variation in baseline\nage across participants.” They also paused their experiment\nafter every ten participants, and continued if the p-value\nwas above .05, but stopped when it dipped\nbelow .05. They found that participants who heard\none song were 1.5 years younger than those who heard the other song, \nwith a p-value of .04. Usually it’s much tougher to spot\np-hacking, because we don’t know the results \nare impossible: the whole point of doing experiments\nis to learn something new. Fortunately, there’s a simple way\nto make p-values more reliable: pre-registering a detailed plan \nfor the experiment and analysis beforehand that others can check, so researchers can’t keep trying \ndifferent analyses until they find a significant result. And, in the true spirit \nof scientific inquiry, there’s even a new field that’s basically\nscience doing science on itself: studying scientific practices\nin order to improve them. "

The Boreads, \nsons of the North Wind who could hurtle through the air. For untold times \nthese heroes had roamed ancient Greece, creating new legends wherever they went. But none of their adventures \nwas so great as when they joined forces for the sake of a young man named Jason. Years before, Jason’s uncle Pelias \nhad ruthlessly usurped the throne of Thessaly \nfrom Jason’s grandfather. When Jason returned \nto his father’s stolen court, the cowardly king \nset him a seemingly impossible task: cross the teeming seas to Colchis, and steal \nthe golden fleece of a flying ram under King Aeetes’ nose. If Jason retrieved the Fleece, Pelias promised to relinquish the throne. Touched by his heroic mission, the Gods spread Jason’s call for help, and soon \nhe had assembled a not-so-motley crew. These heroes, alongside countless sailors,\nsoothsayers, and rebel demigods, named themselves \nthe Argonauts after their sturdy ship. But the path ahead \nwas marked with untold terrors– enough to test even the fiercest heroes. Their first stop was Lemnos, an isle of women \nwho had killed all the island’s men. As punishment, Aphrodite had cursed them\nwith a sickening stench– but that didn’t stop Jason \nfathering twins with the queen. The rest of the crew also found themselves\nembroiled in new romances; until Hercules chastised them \nfor not behaving like heroes. Eventually, \nthey sailed on to the Mount of Bears, an island where a group of ancient, \nsix-armed monsters lived alongside the peaceful Doliones. While the clan welcomed \nthe Argonauts with open arms, the monsters surged down \nfrom the mountains and hurled rocks at the docked ship. Hercules held them off single-handedly, before his comrades joined the fray. Bolstered by their victory, \nthe triumphant heroes sailed onward– only to be blown back \nto the island several stormy nights later. In the tempest, the Doliones \nthought these new arrivals invaders. The Argonauts were similarly unaware \nof their surroundings, and fought blunderingly in the dark, \nslaying wave after wave of foe. But the morning light \nrevealed a horrible truth: their victims \nwere none other than their previous hosts. Yet again, Jason had allowed the crew \nto be distracted, this time at a terrible cost. Ashamed at his conduct, he resolved \nto focus only on the Fleece, but even this haste proved ruinous. When Hercules’ squire \nwas abducted by a water nymph, Jason sailed on– oblivious to the absence \nof his most powerful crewmate. The remaining Argonauts \ncontinued their quest, until stopping at the sight of an old man \nsurrounded by a swirl of harpies. This was Phineas, \na seer cursed by Zeus to endure \nold age, blindness, and endless torture for giving away \nhis prophecies. Moved by his plight, \nthe wind brothers set upon the flock, providing Phineas \nwith a brief respite from his punishment. In return, the seer told them how to overcome\nthe terrifying trial that lay ahead: the Symplegades, a pair clashing rocks \nthat reduced ships to splinters. But first, the Argonauts would have to maneuver \npast the mouth of hell, around the island \nof the bloodthirsty Amazons, and under psychedelic skies. These adventures cost the crew \nboth in men and morale– and some feared \nthey might be losing their minds. Upon reaching the clashing rocks, \nthe exhausted crew quaked with fear. But Phineas’ advice rang in their heads. The Argonauts released a single dove and sped through in its wake \nto emerge unscathed. With this narrow escape, the Argonauts \nfinally had Colchis in their sights. Yet while Jason rested \nand celebrated with his crew, he could feel his time \namong them was drawing to a close. As the fleece gleamed in his mind, he knew \nhe would have to retrieve it alone. But he could not guess \nthat this final task would have the most horrible price of all. "

She could pluck clouds from the sky\nand spin them into the softest robes. Her work was so precise, not even the most expert eye\ncould find a seam. But her craft was the same day after day,\nand she longed for new inspiration. Finally, the Queen Mother granted \nthe weaver permission to visit Earth. The other princesses would accompany her to protect their sister \nfrom earthly dangers. Dressed in special robes that allowed them\nto fly between Heaven and Earth, the sisters soared down from the sky. The weaver was in awe \nof the rolling hills and rivers, and the sisters decided to swim\nin one of the glittering streams. As the weaver floated,\nshe dreamt about staying forever. Meanwhile, a lone cowherd\napproached the riverbank. He came here often\nto sweep his parent’s grave and speak with his only companion— a stoic bull who listened patiently \nto the cowherd’s sorrows. But upon seeing the weaver’s beauty,\nthe cowherd forgot his routine. While he longed to introduce himself,\nhis lonely lifestyle had made him timid. Thankfully, the bull saw his friend's\nplight and offered some advice. He told the cowherd of the swimmer’s \ncelestial origins and of her dream to stay on Earth; but also that she could only remain \nif she lost her ticket back to Heaven. As the cowherd approached,\nthe princesses flew away in fear— leaving their dreaming sister behind. While keeping her magic robes hidden, the cowherd offered his own garment \nas a substitute. And after gaining her trust, \nthe pair began exploring the countryside. She was struck by his caring nature, and he learned to see \nthe world’s wonder through her eyes. Before long, the two had\nfallen deeply in love. The weaver and the cowherd\nbuilt a prosperous life. Their farm flourished, and the weaver \ntaught her skills to local villagers. As time marched on, the pair was \nblessed with two healthy children, but their bull was growing old. Before he died, the bull implored\nthe family to keep his hide and use its magic at their time of need. While the husband grieved for his friend, the weaver’s mind turned\nto her other family. Dusting off her magical robe,\nshe decided to pay a visit to the heavens. But when the weaver\nswept into her old home, no one seemed surprised to see her. With a start, she realized\nthat barely any time had passed— for a year on Earth\nwas merely a day in Heaven. When her family learned of her new life,\nthey were enraged. How dare she waste her love on a human? The weaver tried to escape back to Earth, but the Queen Mother plucked \na golden hairpin from her head and tore through the sky. A great gulf opened, forming a river\nof stars between Heaven and Earth. Below, the cowherd trembled, but he also\nremembered the bull’s final words. Hastily placing each child in a basket, he draped the bull’s pelt\nover his back and hurtled upwards. Above the clouds, each lover attempted\nto wade through the surging stars. But no matter how hard they struggled, the gulf between them\nonly grew wider. Day after day, the Queen Mother\nwatched without pity. Years passed, and the weaver \nand the cowherd had no one, except the passing magpies \nto cheer them on. Finally, their love moved\nthe Queen Mother’s heart. While she couldn’t forgive\nher granddaughter entirely, the Queen Mother would allow the weaver\nto meet her earthly family once a year. And so, in late summer, the magpies\nform a bridge across the Milky Way, reuniting the weaver and the cowherd. At this time of year, millions of people\nin East and Southeast Asian countries tell similar tales of these \nstar-crossed lovers, celebrating their annual reunion. "

Each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two states\nfor two possible values, 0 and 1. Files and programs consist of millions\nof these bits, all processed in \nthe central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain. And as the number of bits needing\nto be processed grows exponentially, computer designers face \na constant struggle between size, cost, and speed. Like us, computers have short-term memory\nfor immediate tasks, and long-term memory \nfor more permanent storage. When you run a program, your operating system allocates area\nwithin the short-term memory for performing those instructions. For example, when you press a key\nin a word processor, the CPU will access one of these locations\nto retrieve bits of data. It could also modify them,\nor create new ones. The time this takes is known \nas the memory's latency. And because program instructions must be\nprocessed quickly and continuously, all locations within the short-term memory\ncan be accessed in any order, hence the name random access memory. The most common type of RAM \nis dynamic RAM, or DRAM. There, each memory cell consists\nof a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges, a 0 when there's no charge,\nor a 1 when charged. Such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly\nbefore they leak away, requiring periodic recharging\nto retain data. But even its low latency \nof 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern CPUs, so there's also a small, \nhigh-speed internal memory cache made from static RAM. That's usually made up \nof six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing. SRAM is the fastest memory \nin a computer system, but also the most expensive, and takes up three times \nmore space than DRAM. But RAM and cache can only hold data\nas long as they're powered. For data to remain\nonce the device is turned off, it must be transferred \ninto a long-term storage device, which comes in three major types. In magnetic storage, \nwhich is the cheapest, data is stored as a magnetic pattern on\na spinning disc coated with magnetic film. But because the disc must rotate \nto where the data is located in order to be read, the latency for such drives is 100,000 \ntimes slower than that of DRAM. On the other hand, optical-based storage\nlike DVD and Blu-ray also uses spinning discs, but with a reflective coating. Bits are encoded as light and dark spots\nusing a dye that can be read by a laser. While optical storage media are cheap\nand removable, they have even slower latencies \nthan magnetic storage and lower capacity as well. Finally, the newest and fastest types of\nlong-term storage are solid-state drives, like flash sticks. These have no moving parts, instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping \nor removing electrical charges within their specially designed \ninternal structures. So how reliable \nare these billions of bits? We tend to think of computer memory\nas stable and permanent, but it actually degrades fairly quickly. The heat generated from a device\nand its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives, degrade the dye in optical media, and cause charge leakage \nin floating gates. Solid-state drives \nalso have an additional weakness. Repeatedly writing to floating gate \ntransistors corrodes them, eventually rendering them useless. With data on most current storage media having less than \na ten-year life expectancy, scientists are working to exploit\nthe physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making \nmemory devices faster, smaller, and more durable. For now, immortality remains out of reach,\nfor humans and computers alike. "

She had been imprisoned for her activities\nas an Allied spy, but with the help of a screwdriver and \ntwo other prisoners, she was back under the Parisian stars. As she began to run, her thoughts leapt to the whirlwind \nof events that had brought her here… Born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian \nMuslim father and an American mother, Noor was raised in a profoundly \npeaceful home. Her parents were Sufi pacifists, who put their faith in the power of \nmusic and compassion. They moved to Paris, where Noor studied child psychology \nand published children’s books. But all this changed with the advent \nof the Second World War. In May 1940, with the German army \nready to occupy Paris, Noor and her brother were faced \nwith a difficult choice. As pacifists, they believed that all \ndisputes should be settled non-violently. But witnessing the devastation \nacross Europe, they decided that standing on the \nsidelines was not an option. Traveling to England, Noor volunteered for the Women’s \nAuxiliary Air Force and trained as a radio operator. She immersed herself in wireless \noperations and Morse code– unaware that she was being monitored \nby a secret organization. The British Special Operations Executive \nwas established to sabotage the Germans \nin Nazi-occupied countries. As a trained radio operator who knew \nParis well and spoke fluent French, Noor was an attractive recruit. In her interview, she was warned that \nwireless operation was some of the most dangerous work \nin the intelligence field. Operators had to lug a conspicuous \ntransmitter through enemy territory, and the clandestine agency couldn’t \nprotect her if she was caught. Noor accepted her assignment immediately. While she was determined to take her \npacifist principles as far as possible, Noor had to learn the art of espionage. She learned how to contact intelligence \nnetworks, pick a lock, resist interrogation and fire a gun. In June 1943 she landed \nin Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed \nwith a false passport, a pistol and a few French francs. But her network was compromised. Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents were arrested, \nand Noor was called home. She convinced her supervisors \nto let her stay– which meant doing the work of six radio \noperators singlehandedly. Over the following months, she tracked and transported supplies \nto the French resistance, sent reports of Nazi activity back \nto London and arranged safe passage \nfor allied soldiers. This work was essential to building the \nFrench resistance and Allied intelligence networks– and, ultimately, ending the war. Protected only by her quick \nthinking and charisma, she frequently talked her way \nout of questioning. When the Gestapo searched \nher on the train, she gave them a casual tour \nof her “film projector.” When an officer spotted \nher hanging her aerial, she chatted about her passion for \nlistening to music on the radio– and charmed him into helping \nher set up the cable. In her entire four month tenure, her sharp wits and stealth \nnever failed her. But her charm had inspired \nlethal jealousy. In October 1943, the sister \nof a colleague, in love with an agent that loved Noor, sold her address to the Gestapo. Noor refused to give away any information, focusing instead on her escape. Secreting a screwdriver away \nfrom the guards, they were able to loosen a skylight \nand slip out into the night. But just as the prisoners began \nto run for their lives, an air raid siren alerted her captors. Noor was caught once again \nand sent to a German prison. Then, on to Dachau concentration camp. Despite being tortured, \ndeprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away. In the moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!” Since her heroic sacrifice, Noor has been honoured as a hero who \nwaged secret battles behind enemy lines– paving the way for freedom \nwithout ever taking a life.

        "text": "You're swimming in the ocean\nwhen something brushes your leg. When the tingling sets in, you realize you've been stung \nby a jellyfish. How do these beautiful, gelatinous\ncreatures pack such a painful punch? Jellyfish are soft \nbecause they are 95% water and are mostly made of a translucent \ngel-like substance called mesoglea. With such delicate bodies, they rely on thousands of venom-containing\nstinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish, \nthe size of a pencil eraser, have the ability to sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like\ntiny flowers pulsating in the sea. As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped\nwith a bell at the top and descending tentacles \naround the margin. The largest species of jellyfish,\nthe lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend \nmore than 100 feet, longer than a blue whale. These tentacles contain \nmost of the stinging cells, although some species have them\non their bells, too. Venom is ejected via a nematocyst, a whip-like hollow tubule, which lies coiled under \nhigh osmotic pressure. When mechanical or chemical stimuli\nactivate an external trigger, the lid of the cell pops open\nand sea water rushes in. This forces a microscopic barbed\nharpoon to shoot out, penetrate and inject \nvenom into its victim. Nematocyst discharge can occur\nin less than a millionth of a second, making it one of nature's fastest\nbiomechanical processes. Nematocysts can continue\nto fire even after a jellyfish has died, so it's important to remove\nlingering tentacles stuck to the skin. Rinsing with vinegar will usually render\nundischarged nematocysts inactive. Seawater can also help \nremove residual nematocysts. But don't use fresh water\nbecause any change in salt balance alters the osmotic pressure \noutside of the cnidocyte and will trigger the nematocyst to fire. That's why urinating on the affected area,\na common folk remedy, may do more harm that good,\ndepending on the composition of the urine. Most jellyfish stings \nare a painful nuisance, but some can be deadly. An Indo-Pacific box jelly,\nalso called a sea wasp, releases venom which can cause\ncontraction of the heart muscles and rapid death in large doses. There's an anti-venom,\nbut the venom is fast-acting, so you'd need immediate \nmedical intervention. Despite the impressive power\nin their tentacles, jellies aren't invincible. Their stinging cells are no match\nfor the armor of thick-skin predators, like the leatherback turtle\nand ocean sunfish. These predators both have adaptations\nthat prevents slippery jellyfish from escaping after they are engulfed: backwards pointing spines \nin the turtle's mouth and esophagus and recurved teeth \nbehind the sunfish's cheeks. Even tiny lobster slipper larvae\ncan cling to the bell of a jellyfish and hitch a ride, snacking on the jelly while they preserve\ntheir own energy for growth. Small agile fish use the jellies\nas moving reefs for protection, darting between tentacles\nwithout ever touching them. Nudibranchs, which are sea slugs\ncovered in protective slime, can actually steal the jelly's defenses\nby eating the cnidocytes and transferring them \nto specialized sacks for later use, as weapons against their own predators. Even humans might benefit\nfrom the sting of a jellyfish one day. Scientists are working on manipulating\ncnidocytes to deliver medicine, with nematocysts rarely 3% of the size\nof a typical syringe needle. So, the next time you're out \nin the ocean, be careful. But also, take a second \nto marvel at its wonders. "

        "text": "Translator: Jennifer Cody\nReviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems\nto lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: \"Be more confident.\" And most likely, this is what you think\nwhen you hear it: \"If only it were that simple.\" But what is confidence? Take the belief that you are valuable,\nworthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes\nwhen you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously \nto face a challenge head-on. This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors \nthat impact confidence. One: what you're born with,\nsuch as your genes, which will impact things like the balance\nof neurochemicals in your brain. Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures\nof your environment. And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about \nand respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle\nthese three factors, but the personal choices we make\ncertainly play a major role in confidence development. So, by keeping in mind \na few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate\nour own confidence. Tip 1: a quick fix. There are a few tricks that can give you\nan immediate confidence boost in the short term. Picture your success \nwhen you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music\nwith deep bass; it can promote feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose\nor give yourself a pep talk. Tip two: \nbelieve in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think \nabout your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed,\nlike a muscle? These beliefs matter because\nthey can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents\nare locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered \nsomething you're not very good at. But if you have a growth mindset\nand think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity\nto learn and grow. Neuroscience supports the growth mindset. The connections in your brain do get\nstronger and grow with study and practice. It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset\nare more successful, getting better grades, and doing better \nin the face of challenges. Tip three: practice failure. Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. J.K. Rowling was rejected by\ntwelve different publishers before one picked up \"Harry Potter.\" The Wright Brothers built on history's\nfailed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. Studies show that those who fail regularly\nand keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond \nto challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. They learn how to try \ndifferent strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere. So, think of a challenge \nyou want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do. Give yourself a pep talk, \nstand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that\nwhatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge\nand understanding. This is confidence. "

        "text": "If you go to the store in search of milk, there are a dizzying number \nof products to choose from. There’s dairy milk, \nbut also plant-based products. To turn a plant into something\nresembling milk, it must be either soaked, drained,\nrinsed, and milled into a thick paste, or dried, and milled into flour. The plant paste or flour is then \nfortified with vitamins and minerals, flavoured, and diluted with water. The result is a barrage of options that share many of the qualities\nof animal milk. So which milk is actually best for you? Let’s dive into some of the most \npopular milks: dairy, almond, soy, or oat? A 250 ml glass of cow’s milk contains\n8 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, \nand 2 to 8 grams of fat depending on if it’s skim, \nreduced fat, or whole. That’s approximately 15% \nthe daily protein an average adult needs, roughly 10% the carbohydrates\nand 2 to 15% the fat. Most plant-based milks have \nless carbohydrates than dairy milk. They also have less fat, but more\nof what’s often called “good fats.” Meanwhile, the healthy nutrients\nvitamin D and calcium found in dairy milk don’t occur naturally \nin most plant-based milks. Looking more closely \nat our plant-based milks, both almond and oat are low \nin protein compared to dairy. But while almond milk has the least\nnutrients of the four, oat milk is full of beta-glucans, \na healthy type of fibre. It also has a lot of carbohydrates\ncompared to other plant milks— sometimes as much as dairy milk. Soy milk, meanwhile, \nhas as much protein as cow’s milk and is also a great source\nof potassium. Soybeans contain isoflavone, which people used to think \nmight trigger hormonal imbalances by mimicking the function of estrogen. But ultimately, soy milk contains\nvery small amounts of isoflavones, which have a much weaker effect\non our bodies than estrogen. Depending on individual circumstances, one of these milks may be\nthe clear winner: if you’re lactose intolerant, \nthen the plant-based milks pull ahead, while if you’re allergic to nuts,\nalmond milk is out. For people who don’t have access \nto a wide and varied diet, dairy milk can be the most efficient\nway to get these nutrients. But all else being equal, \nany one of these four milks is nutritious enough to be part \nof a balanced diet. That’s why for many people, \nthe milk that’s best for you is actually the milk \nthat’s best for the planet. So which uses the fewest resources\nand produces the least pollution? It takes almost 4 square kilometers\nto produce just one glass of cow’s milk, land use that drives deforestation\nand habitat destruction. Most of that is land the cows live on,\nand some is used to grow their feed. Many cows eat soy beans and oats. It takes much less land to grow \nthe oats or soybeans for milk than it does to feed a dairy cow— only about a quarter square kilometer\nper glass. Almond milk has similar land use. But where that land is also matters— soybean farms are a major driver\nof deforestation, while oat and almond farms aren’t. Making milk uses water \nevery step of the way, but it’s the farming stage \nwhere big differences emerge. Dairy milk uses the most water—\nabout 120 liters per glass, mostly to water cows \nand grow their food. Almonds take second place, at more\nthan 70 liters of water per glass. Most of that water is used to grow\nalmond trees, which take years of watering before\nthey start producing almonds. The trees must be watered consistently,\nor they die, while many other crops can be\nleft fallow and still produce later. All told, soy and oats require less \nwater to grow: only about 5 to 10 liters \nper glass of milk. Milk production generates some\ngreenhouse gas emissions— about 0.1 to 0.2 kilograms per glass \nfor the plant-based milks. But for dairy milk, the cows themselves \nalso produce emissions by burping and farting out large\nquantities of the gas methane. Overall, each glass of dairy milk contributes over half a kilogram \nof greenhouse gas emissions. So while depending on your dietary\nneeds, any one of these milks may be a good\nfit, in terms of the health of our planet there’s a strong case for choosing \nplant-based milks, particularly oat or soy milk.

        "text": "What do an ancient Greek philosopher and a 19th century Quaker have in common \nwith Nobel Prize-winning scientists? Although they are separated \nover 2,400 years of history, each of them contributed \nto answering the eternal question: what is stuff made of? It was around 440 BCE \nthat Democritus first proposed that everything in the world \nwas made up of tiny particles surrounded by empty space. And he even speculated \nthat they vary in size and shape depending on the substance they compose. He called these particles \"atomos,\"\nGreek for indivisible. His ideas were opposed by\nthe more popular philosophers of his day. Aristotle, for instance, disagreed completely, stating instead that matter \nwas made of four elements: earth, wind, water and fire, and most later scientists followed suit. Atoms would remain \nall but forgotten until 1808, when a Quaker teacher named John Dalton \nsought to challenge Aristotelian theory. Whereas Democritus's atomism\nhad been purely theoretical, Dalton showed that common substances\nalways broke down into the same elements in the same proportions. He concluded that the various compounds were combinations of atoms \nof different elements, each of a particular size and mass that could neither be created \nnor destroyed. Though he received \nmany honors for his work, as a Quaker, Dalton lived modestly \nuntil the end of his days. Atomic theory was now accepted \nby the scientific community, but the next major advancement would not come \nuntil nearly a century later with the physicist J.J. Thompson's \n1897 discovery of the electron. In what we might call \nthe chocolate chip cookie model of the atom, he showed atoms as \nuniformly packed spheres of positive matter filled with negatively charged electrons. Thompson won a Nobel Prize in 1906 \nfor his electron discovery, but his model of the atom \ndidn't stick around long. This was because he happened \nto have some pretty smart students, including a certain Ernest Rutherford, who would become known \nas the father of the nuclear age. While studying the effects \nof X-rays on gases, Rutherford decided \nto investigate atoms more closely by shooting small, positively charged \nalpha particles at a sheet of gold foil. Under Thompson's model, the atom's thinly dispersed \npositive charge would not be enough \nto deflect the particles in any one place. The effect would have been \nlike a bunch of tennis balls punching through a thin paper screen. But while most of the particles \ndid pass through, some bounced right back, suggesting that the foil was more \nlike a thick net with a very large mesh. Rutherford concluded that atoms \nconsisted largely of empty space with just a few electrons, while most of the mass \nwas concentrated in the center, which he termed the nucleus. The alpha particles \npassed through the gaps but bounced back from the dense, \npositively charged nucleus. But the atomic theory \nwasn't complete just yet. In 1913, another of Thompson's students \nby the name of Niels Bohr expanded on Rutherford's nuclear model. Drawing on earlier work \nby Max Planck and Albert Einstein he stipulated that electrons \norbit the nucleus at fixed energies and distances, able to jump from one level to another,\nbut not to exist in the space between. Bohr's planetary model took center stage, but soon, it too encountered \nsome complications. Experiments had shown that rather than \nsimply being discrete particles, electrons simultaneously \nbehaved like waves, not being confined \nto a particular point in space. And in formulating \nhis famous uncertainty principle, Werner Heisenberg showed \nit was impossible to determine both the exact \nposition and speed of electrons as they moved around an atom. The idea that electrons \ncannot be pinpointed but exist within \na range of possible locations gave rise to the current \nquantum model of the atom, a fascinating theory \nwith a whole new set of complexities whose implications \nhave yet to be fully grasped. Even though our understanding \nof atoms keeps changing, the basic fact of atoms remains, so let's celebrate \nthe triumph of atomic theory with some fireworks. As electrons circling an atom \nshift between energy levels, they absorb or release energy in the form\nof specific wavelengths of light, resulting in \nall the marvelous colors we see. And we can imagine Democritus \nwatching from somewhere, satisfied that over two millennia later, he turned out \nto have been right all along. "

        "text": "Animated corpses appear\nin stories all over the world throughout recorded history. But zombies have a distinct lineage— one that traces back \nto Equatorial and Central Africa. The first clue is in the word \n“zombie” itself. Its exact etymological origins \nare unknown, but there are several candidates. The Mitsogho people of Gabon, for example,\nuse the word “ndzumbi” for corpse. The Kikongo word “nzambi” refers\nvariously to the supreme being, an ancestor with superhuman abilities,\nor another deity. And, in certain languages spoken\nin Angola and the Congo, “zumbi” refers to an object inhabited \nby a spirit, or someone returned from the dead. There are also similarities\nin certain cultural beliefs. For example, in Kongo tradition, \nit’s thought that once someone dies, their spirit can be housed \nin a physical object which might bring protection \nand good luck. Similar beliefs about what\nmight happen to someone’s soul after death are held \nin various parts of Africa. Between 1517 and 1804, France and Spain enslaved \nhundreds of thousands of African people, taking them to the Caribbean island that now contains Haiti \nand the Dominican Republic. There, the religious beliefs \nof enslaved African people mixed with the Catholic traditions \nof colonial authorities and a religion known as “vodou” developed. According to some vodou beliefs, a \nperson’s soul can be captured and stored, becoming a body-less “zombi.” Alternatively, if a body isn’t properly\nattended to soon after death, a sorcerer called a “bokor”\ncan capture a corpse and turn it into a soulless zombi\nthat will perform their bidding. Historically, these zombis were said \nto be put to work as laborers who needed neither food nor rest \nand would enrich their captor’s fortune. In other words, zombification seemed \nto represent the horrors of enslavement that many Haitian people experienced. It was the worst possible fate: a form of enslavement that not even\ndeath could free you from. The zombi was deprived of an afterlife\nand trapped in eternal subjugation. Because of this, in Haitian culture, zombis are commonly seen as victims\ndeserving of sympathy and care. The zombie underwent a transformation\nafter the US occupation of Haiti began in 1915— this time, through the lens\nof Western pop culture. During the occupation, US citizens\npropagated many racist beliefs about Black Haitian people. Among false accounts\nof devil worship and human sacrifice, zombie stories captured\nthe American imagination. And in 1932, zombies debuted\non the big screen in a film called “White Zombie.” Set in Haiti, the film’s protagonist \nmust rescue his fiancée from an evil vodou master who runs \na sugar mill using zombi labor. Notably, the film's main object of\nsympathy isn't the enslaved workforce, but the victimized white woman. Over the following decades, zombies\nappeared in many American films, usually with loose references\nto Haitian culture, though some veered off to involve\naliens and Nazis. Then came the wildly influential 1968 film\n“Night of the Living Dead,” in which a group of strangers tries \nto survive an onslaught of slow-moving, flesh-eating monsters. The film’s director remarked that he never\nenvisioned his living dead as zombies. Instead, it was the audience who\nrecognized them as such. But from then on, zombies became linked\nto an insatiable craving for flesh— with a particular taste for brains added\nin 1985′s “The Return of the Living Dead.” In these and many subsequent films,\nno sorcerer controls the zombies; they’re the monsters. And in many iterations, \nlater fueled by 2002′s “28 Days Later,” zombification became \na contagious phenomenon. For decades now, artists around the world\nhave used zombies to shine a light on the social ills \nand anxieties of their moment— from consumer culture to the global lack\nof disaster preparedness. But, in effect, American pop culture also\ninitially erased the zombies origins— cannibalizing its original significance and transforming the victim \ninto the monster. "

        "text": "In Warsaw, late October 1943, Irena Sendler and Janina Grabowska \nwere enjoying a rare moment of peace in their war-torn city. But their laughter froze when they heard\nthe Gestapo pounding on Sendler’s door. Sendler rushed to the window to dispose\nof incriminating evidence— only to see more police patrolling below. Knowing she was minutes from arrest, she tossed Janina \nher most dangerous possession: a glass jar containing the names \nof over 2,000 Jewish children she’d smuggled to safety. This arrest wasn’t the first consequence \nSendler had faced in her lifelong crusade\nagainst anti-Semitism. Born to Catholic parents in 1910,\nshe grew up in a predominantly Jewish town where her father treated poor Jewish \npatients other doctors refused to help. Irena was furious at the constant\ndiscrimination against her Jewish friends. As a graduate student in social welfare\nat the University of Warsaw, Sendler publicly denounced \nthe segregation of classrooms and defaced her non-Jewish identity card— earning her a suspension and a reputation\nfor troublemaking. Buoyed by her socialist ideals \nand inspired by her fellow social workers, Sendler assisted vulnerable Jewish\nfamilies across Warsaw, pushing back on the waves of anti-Semitism\nsurging through Europe. But in September 1939, \nNazi Germany invaded Poland, bringing laws that further\neroded Jewish rights. In 1940, Hitler announced that hundreds\nof thousands of Jews in Warsaw were to be forced into just \nover one square mile of land. Bordered by high walls and subject \nto constant surveillance, families living in the Warsaw Ghetto\nquickly became starving and sick. Appalled, Sendler and her colleagues\nsecured passes to the ghetto on the pretense of checking\nfor typhus outbreaks. At first, her group worked \nto smuggle in resources with the help of sympathetic Polish \nofficials and the medical underground. But as desperate parents began sending\ntheir children through sewers and over walls, it became clear that\nto help these people survive, Sendler needed to help them escape. Sendler and her associates developed \na coordinated campaign of rescue missions. Children were bundled into dirty laundry,\npacked into boxes on cargo trains, and carried beneath the Gestapo’s noses \nin coffins, toolboxes, and briefcases. Bigger children escaped \nthrough the courthouse and church, which straddled the ghetto’s boundaries. Sendler helped ferry these children \nto safe houses, before forging them new documents \nand sending them to orphanages, convents, and foster families\nacross Poland. To retain their Jewish identities\nand keep track of every child, Sendler kept painstaking records\non thin cigarette paper and stored them in glass jars. This work was punishable by death. But for Sendler, such consequences\npaled in comparison to the pain of convincing parents\nto part with their children— often with no promise of a reunion. In 1942, the Nazis began transporting \nJews from the ghetto into concentration camps. Sendler worked with new urgency, joining forces with the Nazi\nresistance group called Zegota. Zegota helped Sendler expand her\noperation by stashing money for her in post boxes across Warsaw. But this system would also be \nSendler’s downfall. When the Gestapo threatened a laundry\nowner whose business contained a Zegota post box, she gave them Sendler’s name. At 3am on October 20th, the \nGestapo burst into Sendler’s apartment, arresting her for aiding Jews\nthroughout the country. The police had captured Sendler,\nbut her records remained safe. Janina protected the children’s names\nwith her life, all without knowing whether \nher friend would ever return. Despite enduring months of physical\nand psychological torture, Sendler betrayed no information. Defiant to the end, she was sentenced\nto execution on January 20th, 1944. But as she walked to her death, \na German officer diverted her course. Zegota had paid the Gestapo \nthe modern equivalent of over $100,000 for Sendler’s release. That night as she listened to bullhorns\nproclaiming her death, Sendler’s work began anew. Remaining in hiding, she continued \nto oversee Zegota’s rescue missions until Germany’s defeat in 1945. After the war, Sendler reconnected\nwith the children she’d helped escape, remaining in contact with many\nfor the rest of her life. And while the new Polish government\nsought to suppress her story, the children she rescued ensured \nshe was recognized for her work. Yet despite all the lives she saved, Sendler remained hesitant to accept\npraise for her actions, remarking, “I continue to have qualms of conscience\nthat I did so little.” "

        "text": "In the middle of the 19th century, the California gold rush brought thousands\nof settlers to America’s west coast. But finding gold may have been easier \nthan transporting it back east. The only hope for avoiding \na grueling six month wagon journey was to travel the narrowest portion \nof the continent— the 48-kilometer Isthmus of Panama. By 1855, a railroad spanning the region\nsignificantly shortened to the trip, but unloading and reloading ships\nat each port cost time and money. To truly connect these two bodies of water\nshipping interests needed a canal— a continuous maritime passage\nthrough the isthmus. The first attempt at this colossal\nconstruction project was taken up in 1881 by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. De Lesseps had supervised construction\nof Egypt's Suez Canal, but his success made him overconfident. He insisted on digging the canal \nat sea level, even though it required boring \ndirectly through the Continental Divide mountain range. Futile excavation efforts were buried\nunder constant landslides. And since the diplomat had only \nvisited the site briefly during Panama’s dry season, his workers were unprepared for \ntorrential storms, venomous jungle fauna, and tropical diseases. After spending $287 million \nand losing a staggering 22,000 lives, the French abandoned the project. The United States had been considering\nbuilding a canal through Nicaragua, but at this point, the chance to succeed\nwhere France failed was tempting. Panamanian leaders were also eager \nto complete a canal which would bring their country\nbusiness and prestige. However, Panama was still a part\nof Colombia at the time, and the country was stalling negotiations\nwith the U.S. Sensing an opportunity, President Teddy Roosevelt \nwent straight to the Panamanians. With encouragement and military support \nfrom the U.S., Panama launched a coup in 1903. Within days, they became \nan independent nation and signed a treaty to begin \nconstruction of the canal. Just over a decade after the French left,\nthe Americans were ready to dig in— and they were determined to avoid\ntheir predecessor’s mistakes. Instead of cutting the mountain\ndown to sea level, they would raise the sea up the mountain. The plan was to build massive steel gates separating the canal into multiple\nchambers with different water levels. As a ship passed through each \nsuccessive gate would open, lowering the water level \nin the next chamber, while raising the ship \nand allowing it to move on. The design called for five \nof these so-called canal locks— three on the Atlantic side\nand two on the Pacific, raising traversing ships 26 meters \nabove sea level. Operating this lock system would require\na massive reservoir of water. And fortunately, the low-lying Chagres \nriver valley provided a natural solution. By building a dam across the gap \nwhere the river flowed out to sea, the entire valley could be flooded. At 32 meters high \nand over 800 meters wide, the Gatun Dam would be larger \nthan any built before. With this innovative plan, the Americans didn’t need to excavate\nthe entire mountain, but rather, just the pathway\nfor the canal itself. Still, the work was staggering. Even after progress made by the French,\nit took over nine years for 24,000 workers to blow up, shovel, \nand drill out the Culebra Cut— a roughly 14 kilometer passageway \nthrough the Continental Divide. The railway, now upgraded and rerouted\nto follow the canal, carted away over 76 million cubic meters\nof excavated rock to be used at the Gatun Dam site. Construction was only half the battle. Leading army officials struggled \nto maintain infrastructure and sanitation, but accidents and diseases took\nthe lives of 5,000 workers— mostly Black Caribbean migrants. Then, in the fall of 1913,\nthe moment finally came. A telegraph signal from President Woodrow\nWilson triggered a dike explosion, flooding the Culebra Cut and joining \nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Today, nearly 14,000 vessels travel\nthrough the isthmus annually— each in under 12 hours. The canal remains Panama’s \nchief source of revenue; and since the country gained ownership\nof the passage in 1999, it has also become a source\nof national pride. "

        "text": "They’ve caused global scandals. They’re banned \nin most athletic competitions. But are steroids actually bad for you? The term “steroids” refers \nto a broad category of molecules that share a similar molecular structure, but have many different functions. When people talk about steroids \nin the context of sports, they’re referring to a subset of steroids\nthat resemble testosterone. Though elite athletes and bodybuilders\nbegan using these steroids in the 1950s, today, most steroid users \nare actually not competitive athletes, but people seeking \na particular appearance. These steroids have two main effects: \nandrogenic, or masculinizing, and anabolic, or growth-promoting. These effects mimic naturally-occurring \ntestosterone, which drives the development \nand maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics\nand general growth in everyone. That means testosterone \nand the synthetic steroids based on it promote body and facial hair growth,\nenlargement of the vocal cords and deepening of the voice, \nincreased muscle mass and strength, and increased stature and bone mass. Recreational steroid users are after\nthe anabolic, growth promoting effects. To make muscles grow, steroids \nfirst promote protein synthesis— proteins are essential building blocks\nof all cells, tissues, and organs, including muscles. Steroids also block cortisol, a signaling molecule that drives \nthe breakdown of substances including proteins. Finally, they may push the development\nof muscle, rather than fat, and boost our metabolism,\nshrinking fat deposits. These properties make steroids valuable\nfor treating many illnesses and injuries. They can help people \nwith wasting illnesses, like AIDS and certain cancers, maintain muscle mass and help burn victims\nrecover lost muscle tissue. So if steroids are used as medicine, they must be safe to use recreationally, \nright? Well, it’s not that simple. To create the desired muscle growth, recreational steroid users must typically\ntake doses orders of magnitude higher than those prescribed\nfor a medical condition. Long term, high dose steroid usage\ncan have both undesirable and outright harmful effects— some of them dependent \non factors like age, sex, and underlying health conditions. We’re not sure \nwhat all the risk factors are, but we do know recreational steroid use\nis particularly risky for adolescents. During puberty, steroid use \ncan prompt bones to mature before they’re done growing,\ncausing growth defects. Adolescents are also most at risk for the harmful psychiatric effects \nof steroid use. The most common of these, increased\nimpulsivity and increased aggression, are well-known as “roid rage.” Up to 60% of users \nexperience these effects. But there are also less common, more damaging psychiatric side effects\nlike mania and even psychosis. Steroid use can damage organs \nincluding the liver and kidneys, and cause cardiovascular problems\nlike high blood pressure. While some or all of those effects \nmay be reversible, steroid use can also cause liver cancer,\nespecially in males. Though recreational users take steroids\nfor their anabolic effects, they also experience androgenic effects—\noften undesired. That can mean increased body hair,\nenlargement of the clitoris, and permanent voice deepening in females. At the same time, excess testosterone-like\nsteroids can cause feminization in males, because the body converts \nthe excess into estrogen. This can lead to breast development\nand shrinking testicles. These effects are not uncommon— about a third of male steroid users \nexperience them to some degree. Excess steroid use can also reduce\nfertility in males and females— by reducing the sperm in semen or \nby causing missed periods and conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome. All these effects may be reversible \nif steroid use stops— but they may not be. The specific steroid, the duration of use, and other factors could play \na role in reversibility. Finally, there’s mounting evidence that users are susceptible\nto steroid dependence. They can develop tolerance and require\nincreasingly large doses over time. This increases the risk \nof harmful effects, all of which are increasingly common \nat higher doses taken for longer durations. Still, there remains little definitive \ninformation on how common and how reversible\nalmost any of the harms are at different levels of use. We don’t know enough, about \neither risk factors or exposure levels, to definitively say any recreational \nsteroid use will be harm-free. "

        "text": "On sunny days, \nthe Roman citizens of Ostia could be found on a long stone bench\nnear the Forum. Friends and neighbors exchanged \nnews and gossip while simultaneously attending\nto more... urgent business. These public latrines could sit\nup to 20 Romans at a time, draining waste in water conduits below. Today, most cultures consider trips to the\nrestroom to be a more private occasion. But even when going alone,\nour shared sewage infrastructure is one of the most pivotal inventions \nin the history of humanity. While many ancient religious texts \ncontain instructions for keeping waste away\nfrom drinking water and campsites, waste management took a more familiar\nshape as early as 3000 BCE. Ancient Mesopotamian settlements often had\nclay structures made for squatting or sitting \nin the most private room of the house. These were connected to pipes which used\nrunning water to move waste into street canals and cesspits. Water infrastructure like this flourished \nin the Bronze Age, and in some parts of the Indus Valley, nearly every house had a toilet connected\nto a citywide sewage system. Ancient Cretan palaces even offered\na manual flushing option. Researchers can’t say for certain \nwhat inspired these early sewage systems, but we do know that waste management\nis essential for public health. Untreated sewage is a breeding ground\nfor dangerous microorganisms, including those that cause cholera,\ndysentery, and typhoid. It would be several millennia before\nscientists fully understood the relationship between\nsewage and sickness. But the noxious odors of sewage have\nrecorded associations with disease as early as 100 BCE. And by 100 AD, more complex \nsanitation solutions were emerging. The Roman Empire had continuously \nflowing aqueducts dedicated to carrying waste \noutside city walls. Chinese dynasties of the same period \nalso had private and public toilets, except their waste \nwas immediately recycled. Most household toilets fed into pig sties, and specialized excrement collectors\ngathered waste from public latrines to sell as fertilizer. In China, this tradition of waste \nmanagement continued for centuries, but in Europe the fall of the Roman Empire brought public sanitation \ninto the Dark Ages. Pit latrines called “gongs” \nbecame commonplace, and chamber pots were frequently\ndumped into the street. Castles ejected waste from tall windows\ninto communal cesspits. At night, so-called gong farmers \nwould load up the waste before traveling beyond city limits \nto dump their cargo. Europe's unsanitary approach\npersisted for centuries, but toilets themselves underwent\nsome major changes. By the late Middle Ages, \nmost wealthy families had commode stools— wooden boxes with seats and lids. And in the royal court of England, the commodes were controlled\nby the Groom of the Stool. In addition to monitoring \nthe king’s intestinal health, the Groom’s... intimate relationship \nwith the monarch made him a surprisingly\ninfluential figure. The next major leap in toilet technology\ncame in 1596, when Sir John Harrington designed \nthe first modern flush toilet for Queen Elizabeth. Its use of levers to release water \nand a valve to drain the bowl still inform modern designs. But Harrington’s invention \nstank of sewage. Thankfully, in 1775, \nScottish inventor Alexander Cumming added a bend in the drainpipe \nto retain water and limit odors. This so-called S-trap was later improved\ninto the modern U-bend by Thomas Crapper— though the term “crap” predates \nthe inventor by several centuries. By the turn of the 19th century, many cities had developed \nmodern sewage infrastructure and wastewater treatment plants, and today, toilets have a wide range\nof features, from the luxurious to the sustainable. But roughly 2 billion people still don’t \nhave their own toilets at home. And another 2.2 billion \ndon’t have facilities that properly manage their waste, putting these communities \nat risk of numerous diseases. To solve this problem, we’ll need \nto invent new sanitation technologies and address the behavioral, financial, \nand political issues that produce inequity \nthroughout the sanitation pipeline. "

        "text": "Across the whole planet, humans eat on average between\none and 2.7 kilograms of food a day. That's over 365 kilograms \na year per person, and more than 28,800 kilograms\nover the course of a lifetime. And every last scrap makes its way\nthrough the digestive system. Comprised of ten organs \ncovering nine meters, and containing \nover 20 specialized cell types, this is one of the most diverse\nand complicated systems in the human body. Its parts continuously work in unison\nto fulfill a singular task: transforming the raw materials\nof your food into the nutrients and energy\nthat keep you alive. Spanning the entire length of your torso, the digestive system \nhas four main components. First, there's the gastrointestinal tract, a twisting channel \nthat transports your food and has an internal surface area\nof between 30 and 40 square meters, enough to cover half a badminton court. Second, there's the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver, a trio of organs that break down food\nusing an array of special juices. Third, the body's enzymes, hormones, nerves, and blood all work together to break down food, modulate the digestive process, and deliver its final products. Finally, there's the mesentery, a large stretch of tissue that supports and positions all your digestive organs \nin the abdomen, enabling them to do their jobs. The digestive process begins\nbefore food even hits your tongue. Anticipating a tasty morsel, glands in your mouth start \nto pump out saliva. We produce about 1.5 liters\nof this liquid each day. Once inside your mouth, chewing combines with the sloshing saliva to turn food into a moist lump \ncalled the bolus. Enzymes present in the saliva\nbreak down any starch. Then, your food finds itself at the rim of a 25-centimeter-long tube \ncalled the esophagus, down which it must plunge \nto reach the stomach. Nerves in the surrounding \nesophageal tissue sense the bolus's presence \nand trigger peristalsis, a series of defined muscular contractions. That propels the food into the stomach, where it's left at the mercy\nof the muscular stomach walls, which bound the bolus, \nbreaking it into chunks. Hormones, secreted by cells in the lining,\ntrigger the release of acids and enzyme-rich juices \nfrom the stomach wall that start to dissolve the food\nand break down its proteins. These hormones also alert the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder to produce digestive juices and transfer bile, a yellowish-green \nliquid that digests fat, in preparation for the next stage. After three hours inside the stomach, the once shapely bolus is now\na frothy liquid called chyme, and it's ready to move into\nthe small intestine. The liver sends bile \nto the gallbladder, which secretes it into the first portion of\nthe small intestine called the duodenum. Here, it dissolves the fats\nfloating in the slurry of chyme so they can be easily digested\nby the pancreatic and intestinal juices that have leached onto the scene. These enzyme-rich juices break the fat\nmolecules down into fatty acids and glycerol for easier \nabsorption into the body. The enzymes also carry out \nthe final deconstruction of proteins into amino acids and carbohydrates into glucose. This happens in the \nsmall intestine's lower regions, the jejunum and ileum, which are coated in millions \nof tiny projections called villi. These create a huge surface area\nto maximize molecule absorption and transference into the blood stream. The blood takes them on the final\nleg of their journey to feed the body's organs and tissues. But it's not over quite yet. Leftover fiber, water, and dead cells \nsloughed off during digestion make it into the large intestine,\nalso known as the colon. The body drains out most of the remaining\nfluid through the intestinal wall. What's left is a soft mass called stool. The colon squeezes this byproduct\ninto a pouch called the rectum, where nerves sense it expanding and tell the body when \nit's time to expel the waste. The byproducts of digestion\nexit through the anus and the food's long journey, typically lasting between 30 and 40 hours, is finally complete. "

        "text": "The city has just opened its\none-of-a-kind Fabergé Egg Museum with a single egg displayed on each floor\nof a 100-story building. And the world's most notorious jewel thief\nalready has her eyes on the prize. Because security is tight\nand the eggs are so large, she'll only get the chance to steal one by dropping it out the window\ninto her waiting truck and repelling down \nbefore the police can arrive. All eggs are identical in weight\nand construction, but each floor's egg is more rare \nand valuable than the one below it. While the thief would naturally like\nto take the priceless egg at the top, she suspects it won't survive\na 100-story drop. Being pragmatic, she decides to settle\nfor the most expensive egg she can get. In the museum's gift shop, \nshe finds two souvenir eggs, perfect replicas \nthat are perfectly worthless. The plan is to test drop them to find the highest floor \nat which an egg will survive the fall without breaking. Of course, the experiment \ncan only be repeated until both replica eggs are smashed. And throwing souvenirs out the window\ntoo many times is probably going to draw \nthe guards' attention. What's the least number of tries\nit would take to guarantee that \nshe find the right floor? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you're having trouble getting started\non the solution, it might help to start \nwith a simpler scenario. Imagine our thief only \nhad one replica egg. She'd have a single option: To start by dropping it \nfrom the first floor and go up one by one until it breaks. Then she'd know that the floor below that is the one she needs \nto target for the real heist. But this could require \nas many as 100 tries. Having an additional replica egg\ngives the thief a better option. She can drop the first egg from different\nfloors at larger intervals in order to narrow down the range\nwhere the critical floor can be found. And once the first breaks, she can use the second egg to explore\nthat interval floor by floor. Large floor intervals don't work great. In the worst case scenario, they require\nmany tests with the second egg. Smaller intervals work much better. For example, if she starts by dropping\nthe first egg from every 10th floor, once it breaks, she'll only have to test\nthe nine floors below. That means it'll take at most\n19 tries to find the right floor. But can she do even better? After all, there's no reason \nevery interval has to be the same size. Let's say there were only ten floors. The thief could test this whole building\nwith just four total throws by dropping the first egg\nat floors four, seven, and nine. If it broke at floor four, it would take\nup to three throws of the second egg to find the exact floor. If it broke at seven, it would take up to two throws\nwith the second egg. And if it broke at floor nine, it would take just one more\nthrow of the second egg. Intuitively, what we're trying to do here\nis divide the building into sections where no matter which floor is correct, it takes up to the same number\nof throws to find it. We want each interval to be one floor\nsmaller than the last. This equation can help us solve\nfor the first floor we need to start with in the 100 floor building. There are several ways \nto solve this equation, including trial and error. If we plug in two for n,\nthat equation would look like this. If we plug in three, we get this. So we can find the first n to pass 100 by adding more terms \nuntil we get to our answer, which is 14. And so our thief starts on the 14th floor, moving up to the 27th, the 39th, and so on, for a maximum of 14 drops. Like the old saying goes, you can't \npull a heist without breaking a few eggs. "

Kim Preshoff explains how using a visual tool called a population pyramid helps policymakers and social scientists make sense of the statistics, using three different countries' pyramids as examples.\n\nLesson by Kim Preshoff, animation by TED-Ed.",

        "text": "Transcriber: Jessica Ruby\nReviewer: Caroline Cristal Russia, with the largest territory in the world, has roughly the same total population as Nigeria, a country 1/16 its size. But this similarity won't last long. One of the populations is rapidly growing, while the other is slowly declining. What can this tell us about the two countries? Population statistics are some of the most important data social scientists and policy experts have to work with. But understanding a country's situation and making accurate predictions requires knowing not just the total size of the population but its internal characteristics, such as age and gender distribution. So, how can we keep track of all that data in a way that makes it easy to comprehend? Complex data is more easily interpreted through visualization, and one of the ways that demographers represent the internal distribution of a population is the population pyramid. Here, the data is divided by gender with females on one side and males on the other. The population numbers are shown for each five-year age interval, starting from 0-4 and continuing up to 100 and up. These intervals are grouped together into pre-reproductive (0-14), reproductive (15-44), and post-reproductive years (45 and up). Such a population pyramid can be a powerful predictor of future population trends. For example, Rwanda's population pyramid shows it to be a fast-growing country, with most of the population being in the youngest age groups at the bottom of the pyramid. The number will grow rapidly in the coming years. As today's children reach their reproductive years and have children of their own, the total population is almost certain to double within the next few decades. For our second example, let's look at Canada, where most of the population is clustered around the middle of the graph. Because there are less people in the pre-reproductive age groups than there are in the reproductive ones, the population will grow more slowly, as the number of people reaching their reproductive years decreases. Finally, let's look at Japan. Because the majority of its population is in its post-reproductive years and the number of people is smaller at each younger interval, this means that at current rates of reproduction the population will begin to decline as fewer and fewer people reach reproductive age. Comparing these three population pyramids side by side shows us three different stages in a demographic transition, as a country moves from a pre-industrial society to one with an industrial or post-industrial economy. Countries that have only recently begun the process of industrialization typically see an increase in life expectancy and a fall in child mortality rates as a result of improvements in medicine, sanitation, and food supply. While birth rates remain constant, leading to a population boom. Developing countries that are farther along in the industrialization process begin to see a fall in birth rates, due to factors such as increased education and opportunities for women outside of child-rearing and a move from rural to urban living that makes having large families less economically advantageous. Finally, countries in advanced stages of industrialization reach a point where both birth and death rates are low, and the population remains stable or even begins to decline. Now, let's take a look at the projected population pyramids for the same three countries in 2050. What do these tell us about the expected changes in each country's population, and what kinds of factors can alter the shape of these future pyramids? A population pyramid can be useful not only as a predictor of a country's future but as a record of its past. Russia's population pyramid still bears the scars of World War II, which explains both the fewer numbers of elderly men compared to elderly women and the relatively sudden population increase as soldiers returned from the war and normal life resumed. China's population pyramid reflects the establishment of the one child policy 35 years before, which prevented a population boom such as that of Rwanda but also led to sex-selective abortions, resulting in more male children than female children. Finally, the pyramid for the United States shows the baby boom that followed World War II. As you can see, population pyramids tell us far more about a country than just a set of numbers, by showing both where it's been and where it's headed within a single image. And in today's increasingly interconnected world, facing issues such as food shortages, ecological threats, and economic disparities, it is increasingly important for both scientists and policy makers to have a rich and complex understanding of populations and the factors affecting them.

        "text": "If someone teleported from sea level\nto the top of Mt. Everest, things would go bad fast. At an altitude of 8,848 meters, barometric pressure is approximately\n33% of what it is at sea level. This means there's significantly\nless oxygen in the air, and our teleported individual would\nlikely suffocate in minutes. However, for people that make this same\njourney over the course of a month, it's possible to survive\nat the peak for hours. So what can happen to our bodies \nin just one month that allows us to endure\nthis incredible altitude? Let’s imagine you’re one \nof the 5.8 billion people living less than 500 meters \nabove sea level. When you take a breath at this altitude, your lungs fill up with air composed\nof numerous gases and compounds. Most important among these \nare oxygen molecules, which bind to the hemoglobin \nin your red blood cells. Blood then circulates \nthroughout your body, bringing essential oxygen\nto all your cells. But as altitude increases, \nthe air starts to get thinner. The relative amounts of each compound\nremain the same well into the upper atmosphere, but overall, there is less oxygen \nfor our bodies to absorb. And if you ascend to altitudes\nabove 2,500 meters, the resulting oxygen deprivation can cause\na form of altitude sickness known as AMS, often causing headaches,\nfatigue and nausea. Fortunately, AMS only happens\nwhen we ascend too fast, because our bodies have numerous ways\nof adapting to high altitudes. Within minutes or even seconds \nof reaching altitudes of 1,500 meters, carotid chemoreceptors in your neck\nsense your blood’s low oxygen pressure. This triggers a response that increases \nthe rate and depth of your breathing to counteract the lack of oxygen. Your heart rate also increases and your heart contracts more tightly \nto pump additional blood with each beat, quickly moving oxygenated\nblood around your body. All these changes happen relatively fast,\nand if you were to keep ascending, your heart rate and breathing\nwould speed up accordingly. But if you stayed at this altitude\nfor several weeks, you could reap the benefits \nof some longer-term adaptations. Within the first few days \nabove 1,500 meters, the volume of plasma \nin your blood decreases, which increases the concentration\nof hemoglobin. Over the next two weeks, your hemoglobin\nlevels will continue to rise, allowing your blood to carry \neven more oxygen per milliliter. Paired with your high heart rate, this new hemoglobin-rich blood efficiently\ndistributes oxygen throughout your body. So much so that the volume of blood \nbeing pumped with each heartbeat can return to normal levels. Over this same time, your breathing \nalso increases even further in a process called \nventilatory acclimatization. After this several weeks \nof extended acclimatization, your body has made enough significant\nchanges to climb even higher. However, you’ll still have to spend\nadditional time acclimating along the way, often climbing back down to recover \nbefore ascending even higher. Because the summit of Everest\nisn't just high, it’s the highest place on Earth. And at altitudes above 3,500 meters, \nour bodies are under incredible stress. Arteries and veins in the brain\ndilate to speed up blood flow, But our smallest blood vessels,\ncalled capillaries, remain the same size. This increased pressure can cause\nblood vessels to leak, and fluid to build up in the brain. A similar issue can occur in the lungs, where low oxygen causes blood vessels \nto constrict, leading to more leaking vessels\nand fluid buildup. These two conditions— \nknown as HACE and HAPE, respectively— are incredibly rare, but can be life-threatening \nif not dealt with quickly.

        "text": "A close encounter with\na man-eating giant, a sorceress who turns men into pigs, a long-lost king taking back his throne. On their own, any of these make\ngreat stories, but each is just one episode\nin the \"Odyssey,\" a 12,000-line poem spanning years of\nAncient Greek history, myth, and legend. How do we make sense \nof such a massive text that comes from and tells of a world\nso far away? The fact that we can read the \"Odyssey\"\nat all is pretty incredible, as it was composed before the Greek\nalphabet appeared in the 8th century BCE. It was made for listeners \nrather than readers, and was performed by oral poets\ncalled rhapsodes. Tradition identifies its author\nas a blind man named Homer. But no one definitively knows whether\nhe was real or legendary. The earliest mentions of him occur\ncenturies after his era. And the poems attributed to him\nseem to have been changed and rearranged many times\nby multiple authors before finally being written down\nin their current form. In fact, the word rhapsode means\nstitching together, as these poets combined existing stories,\njokes, myths, and songs into a single narrative. To recite these massive epics live, rhapsodes employed a steady meter, along with mnemonic devices, like repetition of memorized passages\nor set pieces. These included descriptions of scenery\nand lists of characters, and helped the rhapsode keep\ntheir place in the narrative, just as the chorus or bridge of a song\nhelps us to remember the next verses. Because most of the tales were familiar\nto the audience, it was common to hear the sections\nof the poem out of order. At some point, the order \nbecame set in stone and the story was locked into place\nas the one we read today. But since the world has changed\na bit in the last several thousand years, it helps to have some background\nbefore jumping in. The \"Odyssey\" itself is a sequel to Homer's\nother famous epic, the \"Iliad,\" which tells the story of the Trojan War. If there's one major theme uniting\nboth poems, it's this: do not, under any circumstances,\nincur the wrath of the gods. The Greek Pantheon is a dangerous mix\nof divine power and human insecurity, prone to jealousy and grudges\nof epic proportions. And many of the problems faced by humans\nin the poems are caused by their hubris, or excessive pride in believing themselves\nsuperior to the gods. The desire to please the gods was so great that the Ancient Greeks traditionally\nwelcomed all strangers into their homes with generosity for fear that the strangers \nmight be gods in disguise. This ancient code of hospitality\nwas called xenia. It involved hosts providing their guests\nwith safety, food, and comfort, and the guests returning the favor\nwith courtesy and gifts if they had them. Xenia has a significant role \nin the \"Odyssey,\" where Odysseus in his wanderings\nis the perpetual guest, while in his absence, his clever wife\nPenelope plays non-stop host. The \"Odyssey\" recounts all \nof Odysseus's years of travel, but the narrative begins in medias res\nin the middle of things. Ten years after the Trojan War,\nwe find our hero trapped on an island, still far from his native Ithaca and\nthe family he hasn't seen for 20 years. Because he's angered the sea god Poseidon\nby blinding his son, a cyclops, Odysseus's passage home has been\nfraught with mishap after mishap. With trouble brewing at home\nand gods discussing his fate, Odysseus begins the account\nof those missing years to his hosts. One of the most fascinating things\nabout the \"Odyssey\" is the gap between how little we know\nabout its time period and the wealth of detail the text\nitself contains. Historians, linguists, and archeologists have spent centuries \nsearching for the ruins of Troy and identifying which islands\nOdysseus visited. Just like its hero, the 24-book epic\nhas made its own long journey through centuries of myth and history to tell us its incredible story today. "

His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had \nbeen marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit \nYaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck \ninto Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted\na giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside \nthe gourd, they dropped it. The gourd broke apart, releasing a deluge \nthat swept the brothers away, separating them from the \ncelestial lands forever. The waters from the gourd \nformed a new world. This realm was covered in seas, \nwhich didn’t exist in the gods’ world. The waters were full of fish \nand other creatures, and dotted with islands and caves. This world of seas was also cut off \ncompletely from the celestial realm, and the brothers wandered aimlessly, even more lost than they had been before. One day, three of the brothers \nstumbled upon a house. In the house lived an elder named \nBayamanacao, and he invited them in. When Deminan caught up slightly later, \nhe followed them into the house. Bayamanacao told the brothers \nhe was their grandfather and gave them a gift of special \ncassava bread. He revealed their family lineage to them: their mother had been the Earth Mother \nGoddess Itibi Cahubaba and had died when they were born. The brothers were grateful for his \nhospitality and insight into their past. But then Bayamanacao turned on Deminan, blowing tobacco spittle from his nose \nonto Deminan’s back. The spot where the spittle landed \nimmediately began to swell and sting. Soon Deminan was delirious and his back was so swollen his \nbrothers feared he would die. Not knowing what else to do, \nthey cut open the welt. A turtle emerged from the \nwound and swam away, alternating easily between sea \nand land as she went. When Deminan recovered from his delirium, he finally understood what the \ncurse of his disease meant: he was a caracaracol, \nable to communicate with the gods.

Historical figures are often controversial, but few were as deified or vilified in their lifetime as the seventh President of the United States. This is History vs. Andrew Jackson. \"Order, order, hm, uh, what were we...ah yes, Mr. Jackson! You stand accused of degrading the office of the presidency, causing financial collapse and wanton cruelty against American Indians. How do you plead?\" \"Now, Your Honor, I am not a big city lawyer, but I do know a few things. And I know that President Jackson was a self-made frontiersman, a great general, a real man of the people.\" \"Your Honor, this 'man of the people' was a gambler, a drunk, and a brawler. Why, I've heard it said that he would fight at the drop of the hat and then drop the hat himself. I ask you, was such a man fit for the most distinguished office in the nation? Can we forget the debacle of his inauguration? Who ever heard of inviting a drunken mob into the White House? It took ages to get the upholstery clean.\" \"That drunken mob, sir, was the American people, and they deserve to celebrate their victory.\" \"Order, order! Now, did this celebration have pie?\" \"Very well. Mr. Jackson, is it not the case that immediately upon assuming office you introduced the spoils system, replacing hundreds of perfectly good federal employees with incompetent party loyalists?\" \"Your Honor, the President did no such thing. He tried to institute rotation in office to avoid any profiteering or funny business. It was the rest of the party who insisted on giving posts to their lackeys.\" \"But Mr. Jackson complied, did he not?\" \"Now, uh, see here.\" \"Moving on. Mr. Jackson, did you not help to cause the financial Panic of 1837, and the ensuing economic depression with your obsessive war against the Bank of the United States? Was not vetoing its reauthorization, as you did in 1832, an act of irresponsible populace pandering that made no economic sense?\" \"Your Honor, the gentleman has quite the imagination. That bank was just a way for rich Yanks to get richer. And all that money panic was caused when British banks raised interest rates and cut lending. To blame it on the President is preposterous, I say.\" \"But if Mr. Jackson had not destroyed the National Bank, it would have been able to lend to farmers and businesses when other credit dried up, would it not?\" \"Hm, this is all highly speculative. Can we move on?\" \"Certainly, Your Honor. We now come to Mr. Jackson's most terrible offense: forcing entire tribes out of their native lands via the Indian Removal Act.\" \"I resent that accusation, sir. The U.S. of A. bought that land from the Indians fair and square.\" \"Do you call coercion and threats by a nation with a far more powerful army fair and square? Or signing a treaty for removing the Cherokee with a small group that didn't include their actual leaders? They didn't have time to properly supply themselves before the army came and forced them to march the Trail of Tears.\" \"Now, hold on a minute. This was all Van Buren's doing after President Jackson left office.\" \"But Mr. Jackson laid the groundwork and made sure the treaty was ratified. All President Van Buren had to do afterwards was enforce it.\" \"Look here, Your Honor. Our government's been purchasing Indian land since the beginning, and my client was negotiating these deals even before he was President. President Jackson truly believed it was best for the Indians to get compensated for their land and move out West, where there was plenty of space for them to keep living the way they were accustomed, rather than stick around and keep butting heads with the white settlers. Some of whom, I remind our court, wanted to exterminate them outright. It was a different time.\" \"And yet, even in this different time, there were many in Congress and even the Supreme Court who saw how wrong the Removal Act was and loudly opposed it, were there not?\" \"My client was under a great deal of pressure. I say, do you think it's easy governing such a huge country and keeping the Union together, when states are fixing to nullify federal laws? President Jackson barely got South Carolina to back down over those import tariffs, and then Georgia had to go discover gold and start grabbing up Cherokee land. It was either get the Indians to move or get in another fight with a state government.\" \"So, you admit that Mr. Jackson sacrified moral principles to achieve some political goals?\" \"I do declare, show me one leader who hasn't.\" As societies change and morals evolve, yesterday's hero may become tomorrow's villain, or vice versa. History may be past, but our understanding of it is always on trial. "

        "text": "For most of the year, the Gulf of Mexico\nis teeming with marine life, from tiny crustaceans \nto massive baleen whales. But every summer, disaster strikes. Around May, \nanimals begin to flee the area. And soon, creatures that can’t swim \nor can’t swim fast enough begin to suffocate and die off\nin massive numbers. From late spring to early autumn, thousands of square kilometers \nalong the coast become a marine dead zone— unable to support \nmost forms of aquatic life. This strange annual curse isn’t unique; dead zones like this one \nhave formed all over the world. But to explore what’s creating \nthese lethal conditions, we first need to understand \nhow a healthy marine ecosystem functions. In any body of water that receives \nsufficient sunlight, plant-like organisms such as algae \nand cyanobacteria thrive. Clouds of algae streak the surface \nof deep waters, and in shallower regions, large seaweeds \nand seagrass cover the ground. Not only do these organisms form \nthe foundation of local food chains, their photosynthesis provides the oxygen\nnecessary for aquatic animals to survive. Besides sunlight and C02, algae growth also depends on nutrients\nlike phosphorus and nitrogen. While such resources \nare typically in short supply, sometimes the surrounding watershed can \nflood coastal waters with these nutrients. For example, a large rainstorm \nmight wash nutrient-rich sediment from a forest into a lake. These additional resources lead \nto a massive increase in algae growth known as eutrophication. But rather than providing \nmore food and oxygen, this surge of growth \nhas deadly consequences. As more algae grows on the surface, \nit blocks sunlight to the plants below. These light-deprived plants \ndie off and decompose in a process which uses up the water’s \nalready depleted oxygen supply. Over time, this can reduce \nthe oxygen content to less than 2 milligrams \nof oxygen per liter, creating an uninhabitable dead zone. There are rare bodies of water \nthat rely on natural eutrophication. Regions like the Bay of Bengal \nare full of bottom-dwelling marine life that has adapted \nto low-oxygen conditions. But human activity has made eutrophication\na regular and widespread occurrence. Nutrient-rich waste from our sewage \nsystems and industrial processes often end up in lakes, estuaries \nand coastal waters. And the Gulf of Mexico is one \nof the largest dumping zones on earth for one particular pollutant: fertilizer. American agriculture relies \nheavily on nitrogen and phosphate-based fertilizers. 31 states, including America’s \ntop agricultural producers, are connected \nto the Mississippi River Basin, and all of their runoff \ndrains into the Gulf of Mexico. Farmers apply most of this fertilizer \nduring the spring planting season, so the nutrient flood \noccurs shortly after. In the Gulf, decomposing algae sinks into the band\nof cold saltwater near the seafloor. Since these dense lower waters don’t mix\nwith the warmer freshwater above, it can take four months \nfor tropical storms to fully circulate oxygenated water\nback into the gulf. This dead zone currently costs \nU.S. seafood and tourism industries as much as $82 million a year, and that cost will only increase \nas the dead zone gets bigger. On average the gulf dead zone \nis roughly 15,000 square kilometers, but in 2019 it grew \nto over 22,000 square kilometers— approximately the size of New Jersey. Human activity is similarly responsible \nfor growing dead zones around the world. So what can be done? In the short term, countries can set \ntighter regulations on industrial run-off, and ban the dumping of untreated \nsewage into ocean waters. On farms, we can plant buffer zones composed of trees and shrubs \nto absorb runoff. However, long term solutions will require\nradical changes to the way we grow food. Farmers are currently incentivized \nto use techniques that reduce the health of the soil and rely heavily \non nitrogen-rich fertilizers. But there would be less need \nfor these chemicals if we restore the soil’s natural nutrients by planting diverse crops that manage\nsoil erosion and fertility. Hopefully we can make \nthese fundamental changes soon. Because if we don’t, the future of our marine ecosystems \nmay be dead in the water. "

        "text": "The discovery of the structure of DNA was one of the most important scientific\nachievements in the last century, in human history, in fact. The now-famous double helix is almost\nsynonymous with Watson and Crick, two of the scientists who won\nthe Nobel Prize for figuring it out. But there's another name \nyou may know, too, Rosalind Franklin. You may have heard that her data supported\nWatson and Crick's brilliant idea, or that she was a plain-dressing,\nbelligerent scientist, which is how Watson actually described her\nin \"The Double Helix.\" But thanks to Franklin's biographers, who investigated her life \nand interviewed many people close to her, we now know that that account\nis far from true, and her scientific contributions\nhave been vastly underplayed. Let's hear the real story. Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born\nin London in 1920. She wanted to be a scientist ever\nsince she was a teenager, which wasn't a common or easy\ncareer path for girls at that time. But she excelled at science anyway. She won a scholarship to Cambridge\nto study chemistry, where she earned her Ph.D., and she later conducted research on\nthe structure of coal that led to better gas masks for \nthe British during World War II. In 1951, she joined King's College to use x-ray techniques to study\nthe structure of DNA, then one of the hottest topics in science. Franklin upgraded the x-ray lab\nand got to work shining high-energy x-rays \non tiny, wet crystals of DNA. But the acadmemic culture at the time\nwasn't very friendly to women, and Franklin was isolated \nfrom her colleagues. She clashed with Maurice Wilkins, a labmate who assumed Franklin\nhad been hired as his assistant. But Franklin kept working, and in 1952, she obtained Photo 51,\nthe most famous x-ray image of DNA. Just getting the image took 100 hours, the calculations necessary to analyze it\nwould take a year. Meanwhile, the American biologist\nJames Watson and the British physicist Francis Crick were also working \non finding DNA's structure. Without Franklin's knowledge, Wilkins took Photo 51\nand showed it to Watson and Crick. Instead of calculating the exact\nposition of every atom, they did a quick analysis \nof Franklin's data and used that to build \na few potential structures. Eventually, they arrived at the right one. DNA is made of two helicoidal strands, one opposite the other with bases\nin the center like rungs of a ladder. Watson and Crick published their model\nin April 1953. Meanwhile, \nFranklin had finished her calculations, come to the same conclusion, and submitted her own manuscript. The journal published \nthe manuscripts together, but put Franklin's last, making it look like her experiments just\nconfirmed Watson and Crick's breakthrough instead of inspiring it. But Franklin had already \nstopped working on DNA and died of cancer in 1958, never knowing that Watson and Crick\nhad seen her photographs. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won\nthe Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA. It's often said that Franklin would have\nbeen recognized by a Nobel Prize if only they could be \nawarded posthumously. And, in fact, it's possible \nshe could have won twice. Her work on the structure of viruses\nled to a Nobel for a colleague in 1982. It's time to tell the story of a brave\nwoman who fought sexism in science, and whose work revolutionized\nmedicine, biology, and agriculture. It's time to honor \nRosalind Elsie Franklin, the unsung mother of the double helix. "

But what ties these two characters \ntogether– and is it a force \neither one of them can control? The collision of different worlds\nis a common thread in Haruki Murakami’s work. His novels and short stories \noften forge fantastic connections between personal experience, supernatural possibilities, \nand Japanese history. Born in Kyoto in 1949, Murakami grew up \nduring the post-World War II American occupation of Japan. The shadow of war \nhung over his life as it does his fiction; \"Kafka on the Shore\" \nfeatures biological attacks, military ghosts and shady conspiracies. Murakami’s work blurs historical periods and draws \nfrom multiple cultural traditions. References to Western society \nand Japanese customs tumble over each other, from literature and fashion \nto food and ghost stories. He has a penchant \nfor musical references, too, especially in \"Kafka on the Shore.\" As the runaway Kafka \nwanders the streets of a strange city, Led Zeppelin and Prince keep him company. Soon, he takes refuge \nin an exquisite private library. While he spends his days \nporing over old books and contemplating a strange painting \nand the library’s mysterious owner, he also befriends the librarian– who introduces him \nto classical music like Schubert. This musical sensibility \nmakes Murakami’s work all the more hypnotic. He frequently bends the line \nbetween reality and a world of dreams, and is considered a master \nof magic lurking in the mundane. This is a key feature of magical realism. In contrast to fantasy, magic in this sort of writing \nrarely offers a way out of a problem. Instead, it becomes just one more thing\nthat complicates life. In \"Kafka on the Shore,\" characters are faced with \nendless otherworldly distractions, from a love sick ghost \nto a flute made from cat souls. These challenges offer no easy answers. Instead, they leave us \nmarveling at the resourcefulness of the human spirit \nto deal with the unexpected. While Kafka \noften seems suspended in strangeness, there’s a tenderness and integrity \nat the heart of his mission that keeps him moving forward. Gradually he comes \nto accept his inner confusion. In the end, \nhis experience echoes the reader’s: the deeper you go, the more you find. "

        "text": "Have you ever wondered what\nhappens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen, after you swallow it? Medicine that slides down\nyour throat can help treat a headache, a sore back, or a throbbing sprained ankle. But how does it get where it needs\nto go in the first place? The answer is that it hitches\na ride in your circulatory blood stream, cycling through your body in a race\nto do its job before it's snared by organs\nand molecules designed to neutralize and expel foreign substances. This process starts \nin your digestive system. Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet\nfor a sore ankle. Within minutes, the tablet starts\ndisintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach. The dissolved ibuprofen travels\ninto the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall\ninto a network of blood vessels. These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood,\nand anything in it, to the liver. The next step is to make \nit through the liver. As the blood and the drug molecules\nin it travel through liver blood vessels, enzymes attempt to react with \nthe ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them. The damaged ibuprofen molecules,\ncalled metabolites, may no longer be effective as painkillers. At this stage, most of the ibuprofen\nmakes it through the liver unscathed. It continues its journey out of the liver, through veins, into the body's circulatory system. Half an hour after you swallow the pill, some of the dose has already made it\ninto the circulatory blood stream. This blood loop travels through every\nlimb and organ, including the heart, brain, kidneys,\nand back through the liver. When ibuprofen molecules \nencounter a location where the body's pain \nresponse is in full swing, they bind to specific target molecules\nthat are a part of that reaction. Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the\nproduction of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals. As more drug molecules accumulate, the pain-cancelling affect increases, reaching a maximum within about\none or two hours. Then the body starts efficiently \neliminating ibuprofen, with the blood dose decreasing by half\nevery two hours on average. When the ibuprofen molecules detach\nfrom their targets, the systemic blood stream carries\nthem away again. Back in the liver, another small fraction\nof the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out\nby the kidneys in the urine. The loop from liver to body to kidneys\ncontinues at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute, with a little more of the drug neutralized\nand filtered out in each cycle. These basic steps are the same for\nany drug that you take orally, but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes\nit into your blood stream varies based on drug, person, and how it gets into the body. The dosing instructions \non medicine labels can help, but they're averages based on \na sample population that doesn't represent every consumer. And getting the dose right is important. If it's too low, \nthe medicine won't do its job. If it's too high, the drug \nand its metabolites can be toxic. That's true of any drug. One of the hardest groups of patients\nto get the right dosage for are children. That's because how they process medicine\nchanges quickly, as do their bodies. For instance, the level of liver enzymes\nthat neutralize medication highly fluctuates \nduring infancy and childhood. And that's just one \nof many complicating factors. Genetics, age, diet, disease, and even pregnancy influence the body's\nefficiency of processing medicine. Some day, routine DNA tests may be able\nto dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency\nand other factors, but in the meantime, your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor\nor pharmacist, and taking the recommended amounts\nwith the recommended timing.

        "text": "What if I told you there were trillions\nof tiny bacteria all around you? It's true. Microorganisms called bacteria\nwere some of the first life forms to appear on Earth. Though they consist of only a single cell, their total biomass is greater than\nthat of all plants and animals combined. And they live virtually everywhere: on the ground, in the water, on your kitchen table, on your skin, even inside you. Don't reach for the panic button just yet. Although you have 10 times\nmore bacterial cells inside you than your body has human cells, many of these bacteria\nare harmless or even beneficial, helping digestion and immunity. But there are a few bad apples\nthat can cause harmful infections, from minor inconveniences\nto deadly epidemics. Fortunately, there are amazing medicines\ndesigned to fight bacterial infections. Synthesized from chemicals or\noccurring naturally in things like mold, these antibiotics kill\nor neutralize bacteria by interrupting cell wall synthesis or interfering with vital processes\nlike protein synthesis, all while leaving human cells unharmed. The deployment of antibiotics\nover the course of the 20th century has rendered many previously\ndangerous diseases easily treatable. But today, more and more\nof our antibiotics are becoming less effective. Did something go wrong\nto make them stop working? The problem is not with the antibiotics\nbut the bacteria they were made to fight, and the reason lies in Darwin's theory\nof natural selection. Just like any other organisms, individual bacteria\ncan undergo random mutations. Many of these mutations\nare harmful or useless, but every now and then,\none comes along that gives its organism an edge in survival. And for a bacterium, a mutation making it resistant\nto a certain antibiotic gives quite the edge. As the non-resistant bacteria\nare killed off, which happens especially quickly\nin antibiotic-rich environments, like hospitals, there is more room and resources\nfor the resistant ones to thrive, passing along only the mutated genes\nthat help them do so. Reproduction\nisn't the only way to do this. Some can release their DNA upon death\nto be picked up by other bacteria, while others use a method\ncalled conjugation, connecting through pili\nto share their genes. Over time, the resistant\ngenes proliferate, creating entire strains\nof resistant super bacteria. So how much time do we have\nbefore these superbugs take over? Well, in some bacteria,\nit's already happened. For instance, some strands\nof staphylococcus aureus, which causes everything from\nskin infections to pneumonia and sepsis, have developed into MRSA, becoming resistant\nto beta-lactam antibiotics, like penicillin, methicillin,\nand oxacillin. Thanks to a gene that replaces the protein\nbeta-lactams normally target and bind to, MRSA can keep making\nits cell walls unimpeded. Other super bacteria, like salmonella, even sometimes produce enzymes\nlike beta-lactams that break down antibiotic attackers\nbefore they can do any damage, and E. coli, a diverse group of bacteria that contains strains that cause\ndiarrhea and kidney failure, can prevent the function of antibiotics, like quinolones, by actively\nbooting any invaders that manage to enter the cell. But there is good news. Scientists are working to stay\none step ahead of the bacteria, and although development\nof new antibiotics has slowed in recent years, the World Health Organization has made it\na priority to develop novel treatments. Other scientists are investigating\nalternate solutions, such as phage therapy\nor using vaccines to prevent infections. Most importantly, curbing the excessive\nand unnecessary use of antibiotics, such as for minor infections\nthat can resolve on their own, as well as changing medical practice\nto prevent hospital infections, can have a major impact by keeping more\nnon-resistant bacteria alive as competition for resistant strains. In the war against super bacteria,\ndeescalation may sometimes work better than an evolutionary arms race. "

        "text": "This is a tomato plant, and this is an aphid slowly killing\nthe tomato plant by sucking the juice out of its leaves. The tomato is putting up a fight\nusing both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds\nthat signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from \nmicroscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids,\ncaterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises,\nkoalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants\nto access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems,\nfruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole\nseries of internal and external defenses that make them a much less \nappealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full\nof lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's\ntough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by\na waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further\nwith painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles\ndiscourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants'\nleaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny\nhooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense\nchemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture\nof histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation\nwhen touched. For other plant species, the pain comes\nafter an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic\nneedle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside\nof animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy\ndesigned to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells\ndetect touch and shoot an electrical signal\nthrough the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release\ncharged particles. The buildup of charge draws\nwater out of these cells and they shrivel, \npulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less\nappealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system \nsprings into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system\nlike animals. Instead, every cell has the ability\nto detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize \nmolecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates \na battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making\ntheir way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls\nget stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section\nof the plant, those cells can self-destruct \nto quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects\nare also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans\nhave adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems\nbecause they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert\nother regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect\nthese signals, they ramp up production\nof defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also\nalerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit\nallies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten\nto twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps \nthat lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene\nof an attack, or fight off predators with teeth\nand claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal.

        "text": "In the coastal waters of the Bahamas, a young lemon shark is on the run\nfrom a surprising predator: an adult shark of her own species. Half of her 17 siblings have already\nbeen eaten by the older generation, and it looks as though \nshe’s about to join them. But just as the predator closes in, she disappears into a thicket\nof underwater roots, safe in the refuge of the mangrove forest. Forests don’t usually come to mind\nas a habitat for sharks. But various marine forests cover roughly \n4.2 million square kilometers of the planet, providing food and shelter\nfor 35% of the world’s sharks. Deadly tiger sharks\nblend into seagrass meadows before pouncing on sea cows \nand sea turtles. White sharks hunt down seals in forests\nof kelp towering 65 meters tall. And lemon sharks stalk\nforests of mangroves— the only trees on Earth \nthat live in the ocean. All these ecosystems have their quirks, but mangroves may be the most unique \nof all. Harboring life between their roots\nand among their crowns, mangroves function as an essential bridge\nbetween land and sea. And to survive between these worlds,\ndifferent mangrove species have evolved various adaptations that \nprotect them and their resident sharks. Taking root in the unstable ground \nof muddy coastal regions is difficult, so mangrove seedlings germinate \nattached to their mother plant. Once they've grown large enough\nto survive on their own, these partially developed plants begin \nto ride the current. Most take root nearby, \nwhile some travel for several months before landing in a different part \nof the world. Once they’ve settled down,\nmangroves deploy tall, skinny stilt roots, crutch-like prop roots \nor wavy buttress roots, to support themselves \nin their unsteady terrain. These newly established mangroves have \nto contend with two additional problems: seawater is high in dehydrating\nand potentially toxic salt, and the mud contains little to no oxygen. This combination would be\nlethal to most trees, but mangroves make the most \nof their marshy surroundings. Rather than being completely buried, mangrove roots \nare largely above the ground. This allows the microscopic pores on these\nroots to take in oxygen during low tide before closing to create \na waterproof seal during high tide. Many mangroves also grow snorkel roots, which can take in oxygen \nthrough the same mechanism, or directly produce it via photosynthesis. To stop salt from entering their system, some mangrove species use \nincredibly fine filters in their roots. Others concentrate salt \ninside special cellular compartments, bark or dying leaves, that then drop off. Some species can even excrete \nthe excess minerals through specially adapted salt glands. All these processes make mangroves\nmore than a little salty, but that doesn’t deter coastal life \nfrom living in their nooks and crannies. While birds nest among mangrove branches, fish lay eggs amidst \ntheir sprawling, complex root systems. Symbiotic sponges and sea squirts \nprotect their host trees from hungry woodboring crustaceans. Crabs, snails, and shrimp \neat algae, mussels, barnacles, and salty mangrove detritus. These animals in turn feed fish, which are devoured by shark pups \nroaming the roots— alongside occasional\nvegetarian meals of seagrass. But sharks aren’t just the beneficiaries\nof marine forests, they’re part of the glue \nthat holds them together. Sharks limit the abundance of animals which would otherwise overgraze \nthese essential plants. Just as marine forests provide shelter \nto vulnerable baby predators, those predators grow up\nto protect their forest homes. Unfortunately, both sides of this delicate\nbalance are under threat. Overfishing has decimated \nshark populations worldwide, and many marine forests are being polluted\nor cut down for coastal development. This destruction\nis especially dangerous because marine forests are one \nof the single most important ecosystems in mitigating climate change. Mangroves and seagrasses trap\ncarbon between their roots, and fast-growing kelps export vast\namounts of carbon to the deep ocean. Together, marine forests sequester around\n310 million tonnes of carbon every year, capturing 3% of our annual\nglobal carbon emissions. So, like the sharks that inhabit them, humans need to fight tooth and nail \nto protect these essential ecosystems. "

The largest and longest-lived\nof the 15 tuna species, the Atlantic bluefin has a unique set\nof adaptations that make it one of the most dominant \npredators in the ocean. It starts as a tiny hatchling in the \nGulf of Mexico or the Mediterranean Sea, no bigger than a human eyelash. Within its first year of life, It develops something known as \nregional endothermy— the ability to regulate\nits body temperature. An Atlantic bluefin gets oxygen \nfrom cold ocean water using its gills. This process cools its blood. Then, heat the tuna generates swimming \nand hunting warms the blood. In most fishes, this heat would be lost\nback out into the ocean through the gills. But in the Atlantic bluefin, a mechanism called countercurrent exchange\ntraps the heat. Cold blood on its way \nto the large swimming muscles passes close to warm blood \nleaving those muscles in a specialized network of blood vessels \nknown as a rete mirabile. Here the heat “jumps” to the cold blood\nand stays in the body. This makes bluefin one of the few \nwarm-blooded fishes, a huge advantage \nin the marine environment. Cold-blooded animals whose \nbody temperature depends entirely on the environment become\nsluggish in colder waters. But a bluefin’s ability to keep warm\nmeans it has sharper vision, can better process information,\nand can swim faster than its prey. It thrives in cold, deep, subarctic water. Thanks to their warm bloodedness, \ntheir powerful muscles, and their streamlined torpedo shape with fins that fold into grooves \nto reduce drag, bluefin tuna can reach speeds\nfew other animals can match. Their maximum speed of 40 miles per hour is faster than that of a great white shark\nor orca whale, and even at their comfortable \ncruising speed, they can cross the Atlantic\nin a couple months. All this swimming requires\na great deal of oxygen, but the bluefin is adapted\nfor this as well. The faster it swims, the more water\npasses over its gills, and the more oxygen it can absorb\nfrom that water. This need for a constant flow of water means the tuna must always remain \non the move. It also means bluefin cannot suck prey \ninto their mouths the way most other fishes do. Instead, they must chase down \ntheir prey with their mouths open. They eat smaller prey than most predators\ntheir size, including squid, crustaceans,\nand smaller fish species like mackerel. The bluefin’s temperature-regulating\nability doesn’t just make it a superior hunter— \nit gives it nearly unlimited range. As soon as they’re strong enough to swim\nagainst the current, Atlantic bluefin leave the warm waters \nof their spawning grounds and spend their lives hunting\nall over the Atlantic Ocean. Tunas from both the Gulf of Mexico \nand the Mediterranean Sea frequent the same feeding grounds and range from Brazil and Texas \nto Iceland and Senegal and beyond. But when the time comes\nto reproduce around age 10, they always return to their sea of origin. Here, groups of males and females release\nmillions of eggs and sperm into the water. They’ll migrate back and forth between \nfeeding and spawning grounds annually for the rest of their lives. Atlantic bluefin can live \nfor over 40 years, growing all the while. The largest specimens are tens of millions\nof times heavier than when they hatched. The same huge size that makes\nbluefin tuna indomitable in the ocean has made them vulnerable\nto one predator in particular: us. Humans have a long history\nof fishing Atlantic bluefin— it’s even stamped on ancient Greek coins. But in recent decades, \ndemand has skyrocketed as bluefin are hunted for sashimi, sushi, \nand tuna steaks. An individual fish can sell \nfor $10,000 or more, promoting overfishing and illegal fishing. But if recent conservation efforts are\nredoubled and quotas are better enforced, bluefin populations can begin to recover. "

Digging a hole under the city \nand putting a railroad in it seemed the stuff of dreams. Pub drinkers scoffed at the idea and a local minister accused the railway\ncompany of trying to break into hell. Most people simply thought the project, which cost more than\n100 million dollars in today’s money, would never work. But it did. On January 10, 1863, 30,000 people ventured underground \nto travel on the world’s first subway on a four-mile stretch of line in London. After three years of construction\nand a few setbacks, the Metropolitan Railway \nwas ready for business. The city’s officials were much relieved. They’d been desperate to find a way to reduce the terrible \ncongestion on the roads. London, at the time the world’s largest \nand most prosperous city, was in a permanent state of gridlock, with carts, costermongers, cows, and commuters jamming the roads. It’d been a Victorian visionary, \nCharles Pearson, who first thought of putting railways \nunder the ground. He’d lobbied for underground trains \nthroughout the 1840s, but opponents thought the idea\nwas impractical since the railroads at the time \nonly had short tunnels under hills. How could you get a railway \nthrough the center of a city? The answer was a simple system \ncalled \"cut and cover.\" Workers had to dig a huge trench, construct a tunnel out of brick archways, and then refill the hole \nover the newly built tunnel. Because this was disruptive and required the demolition \nof buildings above the tunnels, most of the line went\nunder existing roads. Of course, there were accidents. On one occasion, a heavy rainstorm \nflooded the nearby sewers and burst through the excavation, delaying the project by several months. But as soon as \nthe Metropolitan Railway opened, Londoners rushed in \nto ride the new trains. The Metropolitan quickly became \na vital part of London’s transport system. Additional lines were soon built, and new suburbs grew around the stations. Big department stores opened \nnext to the railroad, and the railway company \neven created attractions, like a 30-story Ferris wheel in Earls\nCourt to bring in tourists by train. Within 30 years, London’s subway system covered \n80 kilometers, with lines in the center of town\nrunning in tunnels, and suburban trains operating \non the surface, often on embankments. But London was still growing, and everyone wanted \nto be connected to the system. By the late 1880s, the city had become too dense with\nbuildings, sewers, and electric cables for the \"cut and cover\" technique, so a new system had to be devised. Using a machine \ncalled the Greathead Shield, a team of just 12 workers could \nbore through the earth, carving deep underground tunnels \nthrough the London clay. These new lines, called tubes,\nwere at varying depths, but usually about 25 meters deeper than \nthe \"cut and cover\" lines. This meant their construction \ndidn’t disturb the surface, and it was possible \nto dig under buildings. The first tube line, \nthe City and South London, opened in 1890 and proved so successful that half a dozen more lines \nwere built in the next 20 years. This clever new technology was even used \nto burrow several lines under London’s river, the Thames. By the early 20th century, Budapest, Berlin, Paris, and New York had all built subways of their own. And today, with more than 160 cities \nin 55 countries using underground rails \nto combat congestion, we can thank Charles Pearson\nand the Metropolitan Railway for getting us started on the right track.

        "text": "A mosquito lands on your arm, injects its chemicals into your skin, \nand begins to feed. You wouldn’t even know it was there,\nif not for the red lump that appears, accompanied by a telltale itch. It’s a nuisance, but that bump \nis an important signal that you’re protected \nby your immune system, your body’s major safeguard \nagainst infection, illness, and disease. This system is a vast network of cells, \ntissues, and organs that coordinate your body’s defenses \nagainst any threats to your health. Without it, you’d be exposed to billions \nof bacteria, viruses, and toxins that could make something as minor\nas a paper cut or a seasonal cold fatal. The immune system relies on millions \nof defensive white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, that originate in our bone marrow. These cells migrate into the bloodstream\nand the lymphatic system, a network of vessels which helps \nclear bodily toxins and waste. Our bodies are teeming with leukocytes: there are between 4,000 \nand 11,000 in every microliter of blood. As they move around, leukocytes \nwork like security personnel, constantly screening the blood, \ntissues, and organs for suspicious signs. This system mainly relies \non cues called antigens. These molecular traces on the surface \nof pathogens and other foreign substances betray the presence of invaders. As soon as the leukocytes detect them, it takes only minutes for the body’s \nprotective immune response to kick in. Threats to our bodies are hugely variable, so the immune response \nhas to be equally adaptable. That means relying on many \ndifferent types of leukocytes to tackle threats in different ways. Despite this diversity, we classify \nleukocytes in two main cellular groups, which coordinate a two-pronged attack. First, phagocytes trigger \nthe immune response by sending macrophages \nand dendritic cells into the blood. As these circulate, they destroy\nany foreign cells they encounter, simply by consuming them. That allows phagocytes to identify the antigen on the invaders \nthey just ingested and transmit this information \nto the second major cell group orchestrating the defense, the lymphocytes. A group of lymphocyte cells called T-cells\ngo in search of infected body cells and swiftly kill them off. Meanwhile, B-cells and helper T-cells use the information gathered \nfrom the unique antigens to start producing special proteins \ncalled antibodies. This is the pièce de résistance: Each antigen has a unique, matching \nantibody that can latch onto it like a lock and key, and destroy the invading cells. B-cells can produce millions of these, which then cycle through the body \nand attack the invaders until the worst of the\nthreat is neutralized. While all of this is going on, \nfamiliar symptoms, like high temperatures and swelling, are actually processes designed \nto aid the immune response. A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria\nand viruses to reproduce and spread because they’re temperature-sensitive. And when body cells are damaged, they release chemicals that make fluid\nleak into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. That also attracts phagocytes, which consume the invaders\nand the damaged cells. Usually, an immune response \nwill eradicate a threat within a few days. It won’t always stop you from getting ill,\nbut that’s not its purpose. Its actual job is to stop a threat from escalating to dangerous \nlevels inside your body. And through constant \nsurveillance over time, the immune system \nprovides another benefit: it helps us develop long-term immunity. When B- and T-cells identify antigens, they can use that information \nto recognize invaders in the future. So, when a threat revisits, the cells\ncan swiftly deploy the right antibodies to tackle it before it affects \nany more cells. That’s how you can develop immunity \nto certain diseases, like chickenpox. It doesn’t always work so well. Some people have autoimmune diseases, which trick the immune system into attacking the body’s own \nperfectly healthy cells. No one knows exactly what causes them, but these disorders sabotage \nthe immune system to varying degrees, and underlie problems like arthritis, Type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. For most individuals, however, a healthy immune system will successfully\nfight off an estimated 300 colds and innumerable other potential infections\nover the course of a lifetime. Without it, those threats would escalate \ninto something far more dangerous. So the next time you catch a cold \nor scratch a mosquito bite, think of the immune system. We owe it our lives. "

        "text": "Your favorite band is great\nat playing music, but not so great at being organized. They keep misplacing \ntheir instruments on tour, and it's driving their manager mad. On the day of the big concert, the band wakes up \nto find themselves tied up in a windowless, \nsoundproof practice room. Their manager explains what's happening. Outside, there are ten large boxes. Each contains one of your instruments, but don't be fooled by the pictures -\nthey've been randomly placed. I'm going to let you out one at a time. While you're outside, you can look\ninside any five boxes before security\ntakes you back to the tour bus. You can't touch the instruments or in any way communicate what you find\nto the others. No marking the boxes, shouting, nothing. If each one of you \ncan find your own instrument, then you can play tonight. Otherwise, the label is dropping you. You have three minutes to think about it\nbefore we start. The band is in despair. After all, each musician only has a 50%\nchance of finding their instrument by picking five random boxes. And the chances that all ten will succeed\nare even lower - just 1 in 1024. But suddenly, the drummer comes up\nwith a valid strategy that has a better than 35% chance\nof working. Can you figure out what it was? Pause the video on the next screen\nif you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Here's what the drummer said: Everyone first open the box\nwith the picture of your instrument. If your instrument is inside, you're done. Otherwise, look at whatever's in there, and then open the box \nwith that picture on it. Keep going that way until you find\nyour instrument. The bandmates are skeptical, but amazingly enough,\nthey all find what they need. And a few hours later, they're playing\nto thousands of adoring fans. So why did the drummer's strategy work? Each musician follows a linked sequence that starts with the box whose outside\nmatches their instrument and ends with the box \nactually containing it. Note that if they kept going,\nthat would lead them back to the start, so this is a loop. For example, if the boxes \nare arranged like so, the singer would open the first box\nto find the drums, go to the eighth box to find the bass, and find her microphone in the third box, which would point back to the first. This works much better \nthan random guessing because by starting with the box \nwith the picture of their instrument, each musician restricts their search to\nthe loop that contains their instrument, and there are decent odds, about 35%, that all of the loops \nwill be of length five or less. How do we calculate those odds? For the sake of simplicity, \nwe'll demonstrate with a simplified case, four instruments and no more than \ntwo guesses allowed for each musician. Let's start by finding \nthe odds of failure, the chance that someone will need\nto open three or four boxes before they find their instrument. There are six distinct four-box loops. One fun way to count them \nis to make a square, put an instrument at each corner, and draw the diagonals. See how many unique loops you can find, and keep in mind that these two \nare considered the same, they just start at different points. These two, however, are different. We can visualize the eight distinct\nthree-box loops using triangles. You'll find four possible triangles depending on which instrument \nyou leave out, and two distinct paths on each. So of the 24 possible \ncombinations of boxes, there are 14 that lead to faliure, and ten that result in success. That computational strategy works for any\neven number of musicians, but if you want a shortcut, it generalizes to a handy equation. Plug in ten musicians, \nand we get odds of about 35%. What if there were 1,000 musicians? 1,000,000? As n increases, \nthe odds approach about 30%. Not a guarantee, but with a bit of\nmusician's luck, it's far from hopeless. Hi everybody, if you liked this riddle,\ntry solving these two. "

        "text": "In 1996, 56 volunteers took part\nin a study to test a new painkiller called\nTrivaricaine. On each subject, one index finger\nwas covered in the new painkiller while the other remained untouched. Then, both were squeezed\nin painful clamps. The subjects reported that the treated\nfinger hurt less than the untreated one. This shouldn't be surprising, except Trivaricaine wasn't actually\na painkiller, just a fake concotion \nwith no pain-easing properties at all. What made the students so sure\nthis dummy drug had worked? The answer lies in the placebo effect, an unexplained phenomenon wherein drugs, treatments, and therapies\nthat aren't supposed to have an effect, and are often fake, miraculously make people feel better. Doctors have used the term placebo\nsince the 1700s when they realized the power of\nfake drugs to improve people's symptoms. These were administered when proper drugs\nweren't available, or if someone imagined they were ill. In fact, the word placebo\nmeans \"I shall please\" in Latin, hinting at a history of placating\ntroubled patients. Placebos had to mimic the real treatments\nin order to be convincing, so they took the form of sugar pills, water-filled injections, and even sham surgeries. Soon, doctors realized that duping people\nin this way had another use: in clinical trials. By the 1950s, researchers were using\nplacebos as a standard tool to test new treatments. To evaluate a new drug, for instance, half the patients in a trial might receive\nthe real pill. The other half would get a placebo\nthat looked the same. Since patients wouldn't know whether\nthey'd received the real thing or a dud, the results wouldn't be biased, researchers believed. Then, if the new drug showed a significant\nbenefit compared to the placebo, it was proved effective. Nowadays, it's less common to use placebos\nthis way because of ethical concerns. If it's possible to compare a new drug\nagainst an older version, or another existing drug, that's preferable to simply giving\nsomeone no treatment at all, especially if they have a serious ailment. In these cases, placebos are often used\nas a control to fine-tune the trial so that the effects of the new versus\nthe old or alternative drug can be precisely compared. But of course, we know the placebos\nexert their own influence, too. Thanks to the placebo effect, patients have experienced relief \nfrom a range of ailments, including heart problems, asthma, and severe pain, even though all they'd received\nwas a fake drug or sham surgery. We're still trying to understand how. Some believe that instead of being real, the placebo effect is merely confused\nwith other factors, like patients trying to please doctors\nby falsely reporting improvements. On the other hand, researchers think that if a person \nbelieves a fake treatment is real, their expectations of recovery actually\ndo trigger physiological factors that improve their symptoms. Placebos seem to be capable of causing\nmeasurable change in blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of pain-reducing\nchemicals, like endorphins. That explains why subjects in pain studies\noften say placebos ease their discomfort. Placebos may even reduce levels\nof stress hormones, like adrenaline, which can slow the harmful effects\nof an ailment. So shouldn't we celebrate\nthe placebo's bizarre benefits? Not necessarily. If somebody believes a fake treatment\nhas cured them, they may miss out on drugs\nor therapies that are proven to work. Plus, the positive effects \nmay fade over time, and often do. Placebos also cloud clinical results, making scientists even \nmore motivated to discover how they wield such power over us. Despite everything we know about\nthe human body, there are still some strange\nand enduring mysteries, like the placebo effect. So what other undiscovered marvels\nmight we contain? It's easy to investigate the world\naround us and forget that one of its most \nfascinating subjects lies right behind our eyes. "

He proposed that people are motivated \nby unconscious desires and repressed memories, and their problems can be addressed by making those motivations conscious \nthrough talk therapy. His influence towers above that of all \nother psychologists in the public eye. But was Sigmund Freud \nright about human nature? And were his methods scientific? Order, order. \nToday on the stand we have… Dad? Ahem, no, your honor. This is Doctor Sigmund Freud, one of the most innovative thinkers\nin the history of psychology. An egomaniac who propagated \npseudoscientific theories. Well, which is it? He tackled issues medicine \nrefused to address. Freud’s private practice treated women who suffered from what was called \nhysteria at the time, and their complaints hadn’t been taken\nseriously at all. From the women with depression \nhe treated initially to World War I veterans with PTSD, Freud’s talking cure worked, and the visibility he gave his patients \nforced the medical establishment to acknowledge their psychological \ndisorders were real. He certainly didn’t help all his patients. Freud was convinced\nthat our behavior is shaped by unconscious urges \nand repressed memories. He invented baseless unconscious \nor irrational drivers behind the behavior of trauma \nsurvivors— and caused real harm. How’s that? He misrepresented some of his most \nfamous case studies, claiming his treatment had cured patients \nwhen in fact they had gotten worse. Later therapists influenced \nby his theories coaxed their patients into \"recovering\" supposedly repressed memories \nof childhood abuse that never happened. Lives and families were torn apart. You can’t blame Freud for later\nmisapplications of his work— that would be projecting. Plenty of his ideas were harmful \nwithout any misapplication. He viewed homosexuality \nas a developmental glitch. He coined the term penis envy— meaning women are haunted for life\nby their lack of penises. Freud was a product of his era. Yes, some of the specifics were flawed, but he created a new space \nfor future scientists to explore, investigate, and build upon. Modern therapy techniques\nthat millions of people rely on came out of the work he started \nwith psychoanalysis. And today everyone knows \nthere’s an unconscious— that idea was popularized Freud. Psychologists today only believe \nin a “cognitive unconscious,” the fact that you aren’t aware \nof everything going on at a given moment. Freud took this idea way too far, \nascribing deep meaning to everything. He built his theories on scientific ideas\nthat were outdated even in his own time, not just by today’s standards— for example, he thought \nindividual psychology is derived from the biological inheritance\nof events in ancient history. And I mean ancient— \nlike the Ice Age or the killing of Moses. Freud and his closest allies actually \nbelieved these prehistorical traumas had ongoing impacts on human psychology. He thought that the phase \nof cold indifference to sexuality during pubescence was literally \nan echo of the Ice Age. With fantastical beliefs like these,\nhow can we take him seriously? Any renowned thinker from centuries past has ideas that seem fantastical \nby today’s standards, but we can’t discount \ntheir influence on this basis. Freud was an innovator \nlinking ideas across many fields. His concepts have become everyday terms that shape how we understand and talk \nabout our own experiences. The Oedipus complex? Ego and id? \nDefense mechanisms? Death wishes? All Freud. But Freud didn’t present himself as a \nsocial theorist— he insisted that his work was scientific. Are you saying he… repressed\ninconvenient facts? Freud’s theories were unfalsifiable. Wait, so you’re saying he was right? No, his ideas were framed so that \nthere’s no way to empirically verify them. Freud didn’t even necessarily believe \nin the psychoanalysis he was peddling. He was pessimistic \nabout the impact of therapy. What! I think I need to lie down! Many of Sigmund Freud’s ideas \ndon’t hold up to modern science, and his clinical practices don’t meet \ntoday’s ethical standards. At the same time, he sparked \na revolution in psychology and society, and created a vocabulary \nfor discussing emotion. Freud made his share of mistakes. But is a thinker responsible \nfor how subsequent generations put their ideas to use? Do they deserve the blame, \ncredit, or redemption when we put history on trial? "

The keepers who locked \nhis enclosure every night were baffled to find him outside\nthe next day hanging out with friends in a tree, or sunning on the roof. Only after installing cameras \ndid they realize Fu Manchu had been picking the lock with a metal wire that he kept hidden\nunder his cheek pouch. The keepers shouldn't have been\nsurprised at Fu Manchu's cunningness. Along with our other great ape cousins, the gorillas, chimps, and bonobos, they belong to our Hominidae\nfamily tree, which stretches back 14 million years. But it's not just their striking red hair that makes orangutans unique \namong our cousins. As the only great apes from Asia, orangutans have adapted to a life\nhigh in the rain forest canopies. Many of the skills they learn\nare transmitted through the special bond they have with their mothers, the most extended in the animal kingdom\nnext to humans. Orangutan mothers usually give birth\nto one baby at a time, waiting up to eight years before\nhaving another. This gives the young, who begin as fully dependent infants, plenty of time to learn how to climb and distinguish the hundreds of plants\nand fruits that make up their diet. Female orangutans even stay with\ntheir mothers into their teen years to learn child-rearing. As they grow up, orangutans also develop\na complex set of cooperative social skills by interacting with their peers\nand siblings. Much like ourselves, young orangutans involuntarily mimic\nthe facial expressions and emotions of their playmates, with behaviors that closely parallel\nhuman smiling and laughter. Once they finally venture out \non their own, orangutans continue to develop\ntheir resourcefulness, putting the skills they've learned \ninto practice. Adults build a new nest each night\nby carefully weaving twigs together, topping them with soft leaves,\npillows, and blankets. This process requires dexterity,\ncoordination, and an eye for design. Orangutans also use a variety of tools\nto make their lives in the jungle easier. They turn branches into fly swatters\nand back scratchers, construct umbrellas when it rains, make gloves from leafy pads, and even use leaves as bandages\nto dress their wounds. But orangutan intelligence goes far\nbeyond jungle survival. Research in controlled environments\nhas shown that orangutans are self-aware, being one of the few species to recognize\ntheir own reflections. They also display remarkable foresight,\nplanning, and cognition. In one experiment, researchers taught\nan orangutan to use a straw to extract his favorite fruit soup\nfrom a box. That orangutan was later given the choice\nbetween the straw or a grape that could be \neaten right away, and he chose the straw just in case\nhe was given another box of soup. In another experiment, orangutans figured\nout how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes\nby spitting water into them. While orangutans are able to pass\ncognitive tests with flying colors, there are certain problems that they\nneed our help to solve. Indonesia has the world's highest rate\nof deforestation, and millions of acres of rain forest \nare burned annually to support the logging \nand palm oil industries. Deforestation exposes the 30,000\norangutans remaining in the wild to poachers. They kill mothers so that baby orangutans\ncan be sold as exotic pets. But fortunately, the story often\ndoesn't end here. Orphans can be confiscated\nand given a second chance. At special forest schools, they recover\nfrom emotional trauma and continue to develop \nessential life skills. Against all odds, these orphans \ndemonstrate incredible resilience and readiness to learn. In Malay, the word orangutan translates\nliterally to \"the person of the forest,\" a reminder of our common lineage. And despite orangutans being some\nof the smartest animals on Earth, outsmarting their extinction requires\nthe creativity, empathy, and foresight that our species share. "

        "text": "Welcome to It Hurts! One of these creatures is thought \nto possess the world’s most painful insect sting. If you were to guess, would it be: the ant that forages \nin rainforest canopies? The bee that protects a hive\nof delectable honey? Or the wasp that paralyzes tarantulas? Let’s find out! Ant, bee, and wasp venoms contain \na variable cocktail of compounds designed to incite unsavory sensations \nand even compromise bodily functions. Entomologist Justin O. Schmidt’s \nsting pain index describes and ranks the pain \nof around 100 kinds of insect stings. One of our three competitors\nclaims the nastiest one. First, let’s consider \nthe Western honeybee’s sting, Schmidt says it’s like “a flaming \nmatch head has landed on your arm and is quenched first with lye \nand then sulfuric acid.” This discomfort is accomplished with venom that’s packed with a pain-causing \npeptide called “melittin” and flesh-softening enzymes\nthat disperse the venom. These enzymes may also cause \nallergic reactions and even lead to fluid buildup \nin the lungs. Because worker honeybees have barbed \nstingers that burrow into certain victims, they usually can't sting without leaving\npart of their bodies behind, which ultimately kills them. Since only the queen bee has \nthe ability to reproduce, a worker bee’s self-sacrifice helps \nensure that the colony— and their genes— will prevail. But before they go, they release an alarm pheromone\nthat activates a mass attack and often targets some of the most \nvulnerable sites on their victim’s body. The tarantula hawk wasp sting is, \nas Schmidt says, “blinding, fierce, shockingly electric ...\nA bolt out of the heavens. Lie down and scream.” The sensation might last just 5\nagonizing minutes for humans, but it leaves tarantulas— the wasp’s\npreferred target— permanently paralyzed. After the wasp stings a tarantula, \naiming for a crucial bundle of nerves, it lays an egg on the immobilized spider. Once hatched, the wasp’s larva spends\nits formative days in the bountiful environment \nof the tarantula’s body— devouring it alive. Aside from paralyzing the tarantula, the wasp’s sting doesn’t seem\nto do further harm. This functions to preserve the spider \nas fresh meat for the wasp’s offspring. The rainforest-dwelling bullet ant’s sting\nyields “pure, intense, brilliant pain. Like walking over a flaming bed \nof charcoal with a 3-inch nail embedded \nin your heel,” according to Schmidt. And this torture\noften lasts more than 12 hours. A neurotoxic peptide called poneratoxin that our bodies struggle to degrade \nis what makes the pain last so long. In addition to agony, poneratoxin can \ninduce trembling, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, \nand even an abnormal heartbeat. The bullet ant is, in fact, crowned \nwith the most painful insect sting. It's thought that they may have evolved\nsuch an excruciating defense because they forage in rainforest canopies\nloaded with predators looking for proteinaceous snacks. They can’t simply jump or fly away, so perhaps they’re better off with this\nreliable, rather off-putting weapon. The tarantula hawk wasp’s formidable sting clocks in as the second most painful \non the scale. And it’s likely the reason this wasp \nhas no known predators. Honeybee stings are in the middle \nof the pain scale. But when many sting simultaneously, what might’ve felt manageable at first\nbecomes all the more dangerous. In fact, insect stings helped enable\nthe evolution of complex colonies that would otherwise represent\nan easy feast to predators. Some stinging insects are, of course,\nmore aggressive than others, but most of the time, they only sting us \nwhen we provoke them. The truth hurts. "

        "text": "Imagine trying to use words \nto describe every scene in a film, every note in your favorite song, or every street in your town. Now imagine trying to do it using \nonly the numbers 1 and 0. Every time you use the Internet\nto watch a movie, listen to music, or check directions, that’s exactly what your device is doing, using the language of binary code. Computers use binary because \nit's a reliable way of storing data. For example, a computer's main\nmemory is made of transistors that switch between either high \nor low voltage levels, such as 5 volts and 0 volts. Voltages sometimes oscillate,\nbut since there are only two options, a value of 1 volt \nwould still be read as \"low.\" That reading is done by \nthe computer’s processor, which uses the transistors’ states \nto control other computer devices according to software instructions. The genius of this system \nis that a given binary sequence doesn't have a pre-determined meaning \non its own. Instead, each type of data\nis encoded in binary according to a separate \nset of rules. Let’s take numbers. In normal decimal notation,  each digit is multiplied by 10 raised \nto the value of its position, starting from zero on the right. So 84 in decimal form is 4x10⁰ + 8x10¹. Binary number notation works similarly, but with each position \nbased on 2 raised to some power. So 84 would be written as follows: Meanwhile, letters are interpreted \nbased on standard rules like UTF-8, which assigns each character to a specific\ngroup of 8-digit binary strings. In this case, 01010100 corresponds \nto the letter T. So, how can you know whether \na given instance of this sequence is supposed to mean T or 84? Well, you can’t from seeing \nthe string alone – just as you can’t tell what the sound\n\"da\" means from hearing it in isolation. You need context to tell whether you're\nhearing Russian, Spanish, or English. And you need similar context to tell whether you’re looking \nat binary numbers or binary text. Binary code is also used for \nfar more complex types of data. Each frame of this video, for instance, is made of hundreds \nof thousands of pixels. In color images, every pixel is represented \nby three binary sequences that correspond to the primary colors. Each sequence encodes a number that determines\nthe intensity of that particular color. Then, a video driver program transmits \nthis information to the millions of liquid crystals \nin your screen to make all the different hues \nyou see now. The sound in this video \nis also stored in binary, with the help of a technique \ncalled pulse code modulation. Continuous sound waves are digitized by taking \"snapshots\" of their \namplitudes every few milliseconds. These are recorded as numbers \nin the form of binary strings, with as many as 44,000\nfor every second of sound. When they’re read by \nyour computer’s audio software, the numbers determine how quickly \nthe coils in your speakers should vibrate to create sounds of different frequencies. All of this requires billions \nand billions of bits. But that amount can be reduced \nthrough clever compression formats. For example, if a picture has 30 adjacent \npixels of green space, they can be recorded as \"30 green\" instead\nof coding each pixel separately - a process known as run-length encoding. These compressed formats are themselves \nwritten in binary code. So is binary the end-all-be-all \nof computing? Not necessarily. There’s been research \ninto ternary computers, with circuits in three possible states, and even quantum computers, whose circuits can be\nin multiple states simultaneously. But so far, none of these has provided as much physical stability \nfor data storage and transmission. So for now, everything you see, hear, and read through your screen comes to you as the result \nof a simple \"true\" or \"false\" choice, made billions of times over. "

Find out as we put this disgraced\npresident's legacy on trial in History vs. Richard Nixon. \"Order, order. Now, who's the defendant today,\nsome kind of crook?\" \"Cough. No, your Honor. This is Richard Milhous Nixon,\nthe 37th president of the United States, who served from 1969 to 1974.\" \"Hold on. That's a weird number of years\nfor a president to serve.\" \"Well, you see, President Nixon\nresigned for the good of the nation and was pardoned by President Ford,\nwho took over after him.\" \"He resigned because he was about\nto be impeached, and he didn't want the full extent\nof his crimes exposed.\" \"And what were these crimes?\" \"Your Honor, the Watergate scandal\nwas one of the grossest abuses of presidential power in history. Nixon's men broke into the Democratic\nNational Committee headquarters to wiretap the offices\nand dig up dirt on opponents for the reelection campaign.\" \"Cough It was established that the President\ndid not order this burglary.\" \"But as soon as he learned of it,\nhe did everything to cover it up, while lying about it for months.\" \"Uh, yes, but it was for the good\nof the country. He did so much during his time in office\nand could have done so much more without a scandal jeopardizing\nhis accomplishments.\" \"Uh, accomplishments?\" \"Yes, your Honor. Did you know it was President Nixon who proposed the creation\nof the Environmental Protection Agency, and signed the National Environmental\nPolicy Act into law? Not to mention the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, expansion of the Clean Air Act.\" \"Sounds pretty progressive of him.\" \"Progressive? Hardly. Nixon's presidential campaign courted\nSouthern voters through fear and resentment\nof the civil rights movement.\" \"Speaking of civil rights, the prosecution may be surprised to learn\nthat he signed the Title IX amendment, banning gender-based discrimination\nin education, and ensured that desegregation of schools\noccurred peacefully, and he lowered the voting age to 18,\nso that students could vote.\" \"He didn't have much concern\nfor students after four were shot\nby the National Guard at Kent State. Instead, he called them bums\nfor protesting the Vietnam War, a war he had campaigned on ending.\" \"But he did end it.\" \"He ended it two years\nafter taking office. Meanwhile, his campaign had sabotaged\nthe previous president's peace talks, urging the South Vietnamese government\nto hold out for supposedly better terms, which, I might add, didn't materialize. So, he protracted the war for four years, in which 20,000 more U.S. troops,\nand over a million more Vietnamese, died for nothing.\" \"Hmm, a presidential candidate interfering\nin foreign negotiations -- isn't that treason?\" \"It is, your Honor, a clear violation\nof the Logan Act of 1799.\" \"Uh, I think we're forgetting\nPresident Nixon's many foreign policy achievements. It was he who normalized ties with China,\nforging economic ties that continue today.\" \"Are we so sure that's a good thing? And don't forget his support\nof the coup in Chile that replaced the democratically-elected\nPresident Allende with a brutal military dictator.\" \"It was part of the fight\nagainst communism.\" \"Weren't tyranny and violence the reasons\nwe opposed communism to begin with? Or was it just fear of the lower class\nrising up against the rich?\" \"President Nixon couldn't have predicted\nthe violence of Pinochet's regime, and being anti-communist didn't mean\nneglecting the poor. He proposed a guaranteed basic income\nfor all American families, still a radical concept today. And he even pushed for comprehensive\nhealthcare reform, just the kind that passed 40 years later.\" \"I'm still confused about\nthis burglary business. Was he a crook or not?\" \"Your Honor, President Nixon\nmay have violated a law or two, but what was the real harm compared\nto all he accomplished while in office?\" \"The harm was to democracy itself. The whole point of the ideals\nNixon claimed to promote abroad is that leaders are accountable\nto the people, and when they hold themselves\nabove the law for whatever reason, those ideals are undermined.\" \"And if you don't hold people accountable\nto the law, I'll be out of a job.\" Many politicians have compromised\nsome principles to achieve results, but law-breaking and cover-ups threaten\nthe very fabric the nation is built on. Those who do so may find\ntheir entire legacy tainted when history is put on trial. "

        "text": "We typically think of ballet \nas harmonious, graceful and polished– hardly features that would trigger a riot. But at the first performance \nof Igor Stravinsky’s \"The Rite of Spring,\" audience members were so outraged \nthat they drowned out the orchestra. Accounts of the event include \npeople hurling objects at the stage, challenging each other to fights, \nand getting arrested– all on what started \nas a sophisticated night at the ballet. First performed in May 1913 at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées \nin Paris, \"The Rite of Spring\" \nis set in prehistoric times. The narrative follows \nan ancient Pagan community worshipping the Earth \nand preparing for the sacrifice of a woman intended to bring about \nthe change of seasons. But the ballet is much more \nconcerned with the violent relationship between humans, nature, and culture than with character or plot. These themes manifest \nin a truly upsetting production which combines harsh music, \njerky dancing, and uncanny staging. It opens with dancers \nawakening to a solo bassoon, playing in an eerily high register. This gives way to discordant strings, \npunctured by unexpected pauses while the dancers twitch to the music. These frightening figures \nenact the ballet’s brutal premise, which set audiences on edge and shattered the conventions \nof classical music. In these ways and many more, \"The Rite of Spring\" \nchallenged the orchestral traditions of the 19th century. Composed on the cusp \nof both the first World War and the Russian revolution, \"The Rite of Spring\" seethes with urgency. This tension is reflected \nin various formal experiments, including innovative uses of syncopation, \nor irregular rhythm; atonality or the lack of a single key, and the presence \nof multiple time signatures. Alongside these \nstrikingly modern features, Stravinsky spliced in aspects \nof Russian folk music– a combination that deliberately disrupted the expectations of his sophisticated, \nurban audience. This wasn’t Stravinsky’s \nfirst use of folk music. Born in a small town \noutside of St. Petersburg in 1882, Stravinsky’s reputation was cemented \nwith the lush ballet \"The Firebird.\" Based on a Russian fairytale, this production \nwas steeped in Stravinsky’s fascination with folk culture. But he plotted a wilder project \nin \"The Rite of Spring,\" pushing folk and musical boundaries \nto draw out the rawness of pagan ritual. Stravinsky brought this reverie to life in collaboration \nwith artist Nicholas Roerich. Roerich was obsessed \nwith prehistoric times. He had published essays \nabout human sacrifice and worked on excavations \nof Slavic tombs in addition to set and costume design. For \"The Rite of Spring,\" \nhe drew from Russian medieval art and peasant garments to create costumes \nthat hung awkwardly on the dancers’ bodies. Roerich set them against vivid backdrops \nof primeval nature; full of jagged rocks, looming trees \nand nightmarish colors. Along with its dazzling sets \nand searing score, the original choreography \nfor \"The Rite of Spring\" was highly provocative. This was the doing \nof legendary dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, who developed dances \nto rethink “the roots of movement itself.” Although Stravinsky \nlater expressed frustration with Nijinsky’s demanding rehearsals and single-minded interpretations \nof the music, his choreography proved \nas pioneering as Stravinsky’s composition. He contorted traditional ballet– to both the awe and horror \nof his audience, many of whom expected \nthe refinement and romance of the genre. The dancing in \"The Rite of Spring\" \nis agitated and uneven, with performers cowering, writhing \nand leaping about as if possessed. Often, the dancers are not one \nwith the music but rather seem to struggle against it. Nijinsky instructed them \nto turn their toes inwards and land heavily after jumps,\noften off the beat. For the final, frenzied scene, a woman dances herself to death \nto loud bangs and jarring strings. The ballet ends abruptly on a harsh, \nhaunting chord. Today, \"The Rite of Spring\" remains as chilling \nas its controversial debut, but the shockwaves of the original work\ncontinue to resound and inspire. You can hear Stravinsky’s influence \nin modern jazz’s dueling rhythms, folky classical music, \nand even film scores for horror movies, which still illicit \na riotous audience response. "

If it lands heads, they should\ntell you “troll,” whether or not they actually support him. If it lands tails, they should tell \nyou their actual preference. Here’s what happens: you poll 200 voters, and 130 say \nthey’ll vote for the troll. For about 50%, or 100 of them,\nthe coin will have landed heads. So you can subtract 100 troll votes \noff his total, and know the troll’s real support \nis 30 to 70, and he’s very likely to lose. The election comes around,\nbut before the results can be certified a third party candidate swoops in \nand burns the treefellow to a crisp. The freshly signed and deeply flawed\nconstitution mandates that this challenger gets to take his victim’s place \nin a new election. The Dormor Polling Agency sends you back \nout on the streets with your trusty coin. Only this time no one is comfortable\nadmitting their preference: supporting the troll is still shameful, and nobody wants to express support of a\ndragon who murdered his way into the race. But your job is your job. \nHow do you conduct an accurate poll now? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 This time, instead of masking \njust one candidate preference, you need some way to disguise both. At the same time, you also need to leave \nspace for some portion of the people polled to express their true preference. But a coin toss only has two\npossible outcomes... right? Suppose you have everyone\nflip the coin twice— now there are four possible results. You can tell the people who flip heads\ntwice in a row to report support for the troll; those who get tails \ntwice in a row to report dragon; and those with any other combination\nto declare their true preference. The chances of getting either\ntwo heads or two tails in a row are 50% times 50%— \nor 25%. Subtracting that proportion \nof the total respondents from each candidate’s score should \ngive you something close to the real distribution. This time, 105 respondents announced \nthemselves in favor of the troll and 95 for the dragon. Out of the total, the coin will make 25% or 50 respond troll \nand another 50 respond dragon. Subtracting 50 from each result reveals\nthat voters seem to prefer the troll by a margin of about 55 to 45. It’s close, but as predicted,\nthe troll wins the election, and you live to poll another day. "

        "text": "It’s just after sunrise, \nand 16-year-old Mori Banshirô is already hard at work \npracticing drills with his long sword. Banshirô is an ambitious samurai \nin training, and today he must impress \nhis teachers more than ever. Today he’ll make his request \nto travel to the capital city of Edo for a year of martial \nand scholarly studies, and he needs their support, \nalong with his father’s. The year is 1800 in the castle town \nof Kôchi, capital of the Tosa domain in Japan. The daimyo rules the domain, and about \n1,500 samurai retainers serve him. For 200 years, \nJapan has been at peace, and the samurai, once primarily warriors, \nnow play a much wider range of roles— they are also government officials, scholars, teachers, and even masters \nof the tea ceremony or artists. To prepare for these \ndiverse responsibilities, young samurai like Banshirô \nstudy the “twin paths” of literary learning and the martial arts. At 15, he went through the rites \nof adulthood and received the daishô— a pair of swords. The long sword is for training \nand combat, while the short sword \nhas a sole, solemn purpose— to commit ritual suicide, or seppuku, if he dishonors himself, his family, \nor the daimyo. Banshirô idolizes the legendary samurai \nMiyamoto Musashi, a renowned swordsman \nwho lived 150 years earlier. But Banshirô doesn’t admire \nhis swordsmanship alone. Miyamoto Musashi was also \na master calligrapher and painter. That’s the real reason \nBanshirô wants to go to Edo— he secretly wants to be a painter, too. After finishing his practice at home, \nhe bids his father goodbye and walks to school. His father is preparing to accompany \nthe daimyo to the capital. The Tokugawa shogun, head of the Japanese \nmilitary government, requires all the regional rulers \nto alternate years between their castle town \nin the home domain and the capital city. The costly treks back and forth \nkeep the daimyo subordinate and prevent them from building up \ntheir own military forces to challenge the shogunate. The daimyo’s wife and children \nlive in the capital full time, where they serve as hostages \nto ensure his loyalty. But the practice \ndoesn’t just affect the daimyo— it determines much of the rhythm \nof life in Japan. Samurai must accompany the daimyo to Edo. This year it’s Banshirô’s father’s \nturn to go, and Banshirô is desperate to go with him; but given that he’s still in training, \nhe’ll need permission from both his father and the domain. At school, Banshirô’s first lesson \nis in swordfighting. Under his teacher’s stern eye, \nhe pairs up with his classmates and goes through the routines \nhe’s been practicing. At the end of the lesson, he reminds the \ninstructor of his request to go to Edo. The instructor cracks \nhis first smile of the day, and Banshirô feels confident \nhe will gain his support. Next, Banshirô practices archery, \nhorsemanship, and swimming before his academic courses \nin the afternoon. Courses cover Confucian philosophy, \nmorality, and history. When the instructor calls on him, he has \nthe response on the tip of his tongue, ensuring another supporter \nfor his campaign. By the end of the day, Banshirô \nfeels confident that his formal request will be approved, but the greatest \nchallenge is still ahead of him: convincing his father. His father believes the martial arts \nare more important than the literary arts, so Banshirô doesn’t mention \nhis artistic ambitions. Instead, he talks about renowned \nsword instructors he can train with, and teaching certifications he can earn \nto improve his professional prospects back in Kôchi. Then, he makes his final, \nstrongest argument: if he goes this time and succeeds, \nhis father can retire and send him instead in the future. It’s this last point \nthat finally sells him— Banshirô’s father agrees \nto take him on his tour of duty. In the bustle of the capital city, \nBanshirô will finally have the opportunity to pursue his secret ambition \nto become a painter. "

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You might have heard that light is a kind of wave and that the color of an object is related to the frequency of light waves it reflects. High-frequency light waves look violet, low-frequency light waves look red, and in-between frequencies look yellow, green, orange, and so on. You might call this idea physical color because it says that color is a physical property of light itself. It's not dependent on human perception. And, while this isn't wrong, it isn't quite the whole story either. For instance, you might have seen this picture before. As you can see, the region where the red and green lights overlap is yellow. When you think about it, this is pretty weird. Because light is a wave, two different frequencies shouldn't interact with each other at all, they should just co-exist like singers singing in harmony. So, in this yellow looking region, two different kinds of light waves are present: one with a red frequency, and one with a green frequency. There is no yellow light present at all. So, how come this region, where the red and green lights mix, looks yellow to us? To understand this, you have to understand a little bit about biology, in particular, about how humans see color. Light perception happens in a paper-thin layer of cells, called the retina, that covers the back of your eyeball. In the retina, there are two different types of light-detecting cells: rods and cones. The rods are used for seeing in low-light conditions, and there is only one kind of those. The cones, however, are a different story. There three kinds of cone cells that roughly correspond to the colors red, green, and blue. When you see a color, each cone sends its own distinct signal to your brain. For example, suppose that yellow light, that is real yellow light, with a yellow frequency, is shining on your eye. You don't have a cone specifically for detecting yellow, but yellow is kind of close to green and also kind of close to red, so both the red and green cones get activated, and each sends a signal to your brain saying so. Of course, there is another way to activate the red cones and the green cones simultaneously: if both red light and green light are present at the same time. The point is, your brain receives the same signal, regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies. That's why, for light, red plus green equals yellow. And, how come you can't detect colors when it's dark? Well, the rod cells in your retina take over in low-light conditions. You only have one kind of rod cell, and so there is one type of signal that can get sent to your brain: light or no light. Having only one kind of light detector doesn't leave any room for seeing color. There are infinitely many different physical colors, but, because we only have three kinds of cones, the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color by carefully adding together the right combination of just three colors: red, green, and blue. This property of human vision is really useful in the real world. For example, TV manufacturing. Instead of having to put infinitely many colors in your TV set to simulate the real world, TV manufacturers only have to put three: red, green, and blue, which is lucky for them, really. "

        "text": "The Tibetan high plateau lies \nabout 4500 meters above sea level, with only 60% of the oxygen found below. While visitors and recent settlers \nstruggle with altitude sickness, native Tibetans sprint up mountains. This ability comes not from training \nor practice, but from changes to a few genes \nthat allow their bodies to make the most of limited oxygen. These differences are apparent from birth— Tibetan babies have, on average, \nhigher birth weights, higher oxygen saturation, and are much likelier to survive than \nother babies born in this environment. These genetic changes are estimated \nto have evolved over the last 3,000 years or so, \nand are ongoing. That may sound like a long time, but would be the fastest an adaptation \nhas ever evolved in a human population. It’s clear that human evolution\nisn’t over— so what are other recent changes? And will our technological and scientific\ninnovations impact our evolution? In the past few thousand years, many populations have evolved genetic \nadaptations to their local environments. People in Siberia and the high arctic are \nuniquely adapted to survive extreme cold. They’re slower to develop frostbite, and can continue to use their hands \nin subzero temperatures much longer than most people. They’ve undergone selection \nfor a higher metabolic rate that increases heat production. Further south, the Bajau people \nof southeast Asia can dive 70 meters and stay underwater \nfor almost fifteen minutes. Over thousands of years living \nas nomadic hunters at sea, they have genetically-hardwired unusually \nlarge spleens that act as oxygen stores, enabling them to stay underwater \nfor longer— an adaptation similar \nto that of deep diving seals. Though it may seem pedestrian \nby comparison, the ability to drink milk \nis another such adaptation. All mammals can drink \ntheir mother’s milk as babies. After weaning they switch off the gene \nthat allows them to digest milk. But communities in sub-Saharan Africa, \nthe middle east and northwest Europe that used cows for milk have seen \na rapid increase in DNA variants that prevent the gene from switching off \nover the last 7 to 8000 years. At least in Europe, milk drinking may \nhave given people a source of calcium to aid in vitamin D production, \nas they moved north and sunlight, the usual source of vitamin D, \ndecreased. Though not always in obvious ways, all of these changes improve people’s \nchance of surviving to reproductive age— that’s what drives natural selection, the force behind all these \nevolutionary changes. Modern medicine removes \nmany of these selective pressures by keeping us alive when our genes, sometimes combined \nwith infectious diseases, would have killed us. Antibiotics, vaccines, clean water \nand good sanitation all make differences between our genes \nless important. Similarly, our ability to cure \nchildhood cancers, surgically extract inflamed appendixes, \nand deliver babies whose mothers have life-threatening \npregnancy-specific conditions, all tend to stop selection by allowing \nmore people to survive to a reproductive age. But even if every person on Earth \nhas access to modern medicine, it won’t spell the end of human evolution. That’s because there are other aspects \nof evolution besides natural selection. Modern medicine makes genetic variation that would have been subject \nto natural selection subject to what’s called \ngenetic drift instead. With genetic drift, genetic differences \nvary randomly within a population. On a genetic level, modern medicine \nmight actually increase variety, because harmful mutations don’t kill \npeople and thus aren’t eliminated. This variation doesn’t necessarily \ntranslate to observable, or phenotypic, differences among people, however. Researchers have also been investigating \nwhether genetic adaptations to a specific environment \ncould appear very quickly through epigenetic modification: \nchanges not to genes themselves, but to whether and when certain genes \nare expressed. These changes can happen \nduring a lifetime, and may even be passed to offspring— but so far researchers are conflicted \nover whether epigenetic modifications can really persist over many generations and lead to lasting changes \nin populations. There may also be other contributors \nto human evolution. Modern medicine and technology \nare very new, even compared to the quickest, \nmost recent changes by natural selection— so only time can tell how our present \nwill shape our future. "

        "text": "In 1970, marijuana was classified \nas a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal \nand had no recognized medical uses. For decades, this view persisted and set back research \non the drug's mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana’s therapeutic benefits \nare widely acknowledged, and some nations \nhave legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a growing recognition \nfor marijuana’s medical value doesn’t answer the question: is recreational marijuana use \nbad for your brain? Marijuana acts \non the body’s cannabinoid system, which has receptors \nall over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, \ncalled endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don’t totally understand \nthe cannabinoid system, but it has one feature \nthat provides a big clue to its function. Most neurotransmitters \ntravel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message. But endocannabinoids \ntravel in the opposite direction. When a message passes \nfrom the one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron \nreleases endocannabinoids. Those endocannabinoids \ntravel backward to influence the sending neuron— essentially giving it feedback \nfrom the receiving neuron. This leads scientists \nto believe that the endocannabinoid system serves primarily \nto modulate other kinds of signals— amplifying some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids \nslows down rates of neural signaling. That doesn’t necessarily mean it slows down behavior \nor perception, though. For example, \nslowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more intense. Marijuana contains \ntwo main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, \nand cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible\nfor marijuana’s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible \nfor the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling \nby binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors \nall over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids \nare released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity \ncoupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system\nindirectly affects many other systems, means that each person’s \nparticular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine \nhow they experience the drug. That’s true much more so with marijuana \nthan with other drugs that produce their effects \nthrough one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, \nvary considerably from person to person. And while we don’t know \nhow exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful effects, there are clear risk factors \nthat can increase peoples’ likelihood of experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age. In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors \nare more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25. The white matter \nis involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development \nof white matter tracts, and also affect the brain’s ability \nto grow new connections. This may damage long-term learning ability\nand problem solving. For now, it’s unclear \nhow severe this damage can be or whether it’s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher the younger someone is— much higher for a 15 year old \nthan a 22 year old, for instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations \nor paranoid delusions. Known as marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside \nwhen a person stops using marijuana. But in rare cases, \npsychosis doesn’t subside, instead unmasking \na persistent psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, \nlike schizophrenia, is the clearest, though not the only, \nrisk factor for this effect. Marijuana-induced psychosis \nis also more common among young adults, though it’s worth noting \nthat psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What’s unclear in these cases \nis whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared \nwithout marijuana use— whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point \nthat wouldn’t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction \nto marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana’s role \nvaries from person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive \nto marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more \nto achieve the same effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there’s no risk of fatal overdose \nfrom marijuana, and even heavy use \ndoesn’t lead to debilitating or life-threatening \nwithdrawal symptoms if use stops. There are more subtle forms \nof marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, \nirritability, and depressed mood, which pass \nwithin a few weeks of stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some risk factors \nare easy to identify, others aren’t well understood— which means there’s still some possibility\nof experiencing negative effects, even if you don’t have \nany of the known risk factors.

        "text": "How does the difference between point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 cause one to have red eyes after swimming? To answer this, we first need a way of dealing with rather small numbers, or in some cases extremely large numbers. This leads us\nto the concept of logarithms. Well, what are logarithms? Let's take the base number, b, and raise it to a power, p, like 2 to the 3rd power, and have it equal a number n. We get an exponential equation:\nb raised to the p power, equals n. In our example, that'd be 2 raised to the 3rd power, equals 8. The exponent p is said to be the logarithm of the number n. Most of the time this would be written: \"log, base b, of a number\nequals p, the power.\" This is starting to sound a bit confusing\nwith all the variables, so let's show this with an example. What is the value of log base 10 of 10,000? The same question could be asked\nusing exponents: \"10 raised to what power is 10,000?\" Well, 10 to the 4th is 10,000. So, log base 10 of 10,000 must equal 4. This example can also be completed \nvery simply on a scientific calculator. Log base 10 is used so frequently in the sciences that it has the honor of having\nits own button on most calculators. If the calculator will figure out\nlogs for me, why study them? Just a quick reminder: the log button only computes\nlogarithms of base 10. What if you want to go into\ncomputer science and need to understand base 2? So what is log base 2 of 64? In other words,\n2 raised to what power is 64? Well, use your fingers.\n2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. So log base 2 of 64 must equal 6. So what does this have to do\nwith my eyes turning red in some swimming pools and not others? Well, it leads us into an interesting use of logarithms in chemistry: finding the pH of water samples. pH tells us how acidic\nor basic a sample is, and can be calculated with the formula:  pH equals negative log base 10 of \nthe hydrogen ion concentration, or H plus. We can find the pH of water samples with hydrogen ion concentration of \npoint 0000000398 and point 00000000398 quickly on a calculator.

        "text": "You’re on an airplane \nwhen you feel a sudden jolt. Outside your window nothing \nseems to be happening, yet the plane continues to rattle \nyou and your fellow passengers as it passes through turbulent air\nin the atmosphere. Although it may not comfort \nyou to hear it, this phenomenon is one of the \nprevailing mysteries of physics. After more than a century \nof studying turbulence, we’ve only come up with a few \nanswers for how it works and affects the world around us. And yet, turbulence is ubiquitous, springing up in virtually any system \nthat has moving fluids. That includes the airflow \nin your respiratory tract. The blood moving through your arteries. And the coffee in your cup, \nas you stir it. Clouds are governed by turbulence, as are waves crashing along the shore \nand the gusts of plasma in our sun. Understanding precisely how this \nphenomenon works would have a bearing on so many \naspects of our lives. Here’s what we do know. Liquids and gases usually have \ntwo types of motion: a laminar flow, which is stable \nand smooth; and a turbulent flow, which is composed \nof seemingly unorganized swirls. Imagine an incense stick. The laminar flow of unruffled smoke \nat the base is steady and easy to predict. Closer to the top, however, the smoke accelerates, becomes unstable, and the pattern of movement changes\nto something chaotic. That’s turbulence in action, and turbulent flows have certain\ncharacteristics in common. Firstly, turbulence is always chaotic. That’s different from being random. Rather, this means that turbulence \nis very sensitive to disruptions. A little nudge one way or the other will eventually turn into \ncompletely different results. That makes it nearly impossible \nto predict what will happen, even with a lot of information \nabout the current state of a system. Another important characteristic of \nturbulence is the different scales of motion \nthat these flows display. Turbulent flows have many \ndifferently-sized whirls called eddies, which are like vortices of \ndifferent sizes and shapes. All those differently-sized eddies \ninteract with each other, breaking up to become smaller and smaller until all that movement is \ntransformed into heat, in a process called the “energy cascade.\" So that’s how we recognize turbulence– but why does it happen? In every flowing liquid or gas there \nare two opposing forces: inertia and viscosity. Inertia is the tendency of fluids \nto keep moving, which causes instability. Viscosity works against disruption, making the flow laminar instead. In thick fluids such as honey, viscosity almost always wins. Less viscous substances like water or air \nare more prone to inertia, which creates instabilities that \ndevelop into turbulence. We measure where a flow falls \non that spectrum with something called the Reynolds number, which is the ratio between a flow’s \ninertia and its viscosity. The higher the Reynolds number, the more likely it is that \nturbulence will occur. Honey being poured into a cup, \nfor example, has a Reynolds number of about 1. The same set up with water has a Reynolds \nnumber that’s closer to 10,000. The Reynolds number is useful for \nunderstanding simple scenarios, but it’s ineffective in many situations. For example, the motion of the atmosphere\nis significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the \nearth’s rotation. Or take relatively simple things \nlike the drag on buildings and cars. We can model those thanks to many \nexperiments and empirical evidence. But physicists want to be able to predict \nthem through physical laws and equations as well as we can model the orbits \nof planets or electromagnetic fields. Most scientists think that getting there \nwill rely on statistics and increased computing power. Extremely high-speed computer simulations \nof turbulent flows could help us identify patterns that could\nlead to a theory that organizes and unifies predictions\nacross different situations. Other scientists think that the phenomenon\nis so complex that such a full-fledged theory \nisn’t ever going to be possible. Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough, because a true understanding of turbulence\ncould have huge positive impacts. That would include more \nefficient wind farms; the ability to better prepare for \ncatastrophic weather events; or even the power to manipulate \nhurricanes away. And, of course, smoother rides \nfor millions of airline passengers. "

        "text": "In a study in the 1990s, participants recalled getting lost \nin a shopping mall as children. Some shared these memories\nin vivid detail— one even remembered that the old man\nwho rescued him was wearing a flannel shirt. But none of these people \nhad actually gotten lost in a mall. They produced these false memories when the psychologists conducting \nthe study told them they’d gotten lost, and although they might not remember\nthe incident, their parents had confirmed it. And it wasn’t just one or two people \nwho thought they remembered getting lost— a quarter of the participants did. These findings may sound unbelievable, but they actually reflect \na very common experience. Our memories are sometimes unreliable. And though we still don’t know precisely\nwhat causes this fallibility on a neurological level, research has highlighted some \nof the most common ways our memories diverge from what actually happened. The mall study highlights how we can\nincorporate information from outside sources, like other people or the news, into our personal recollections\nwithout realizing it. This kind of suggestibility is just \none influence on our memories. Take another study, in which researchers briefly showed \na random collection of photographs to a group of participants, including images of a university campus\nnone of them had ever visited. When shown the images three weeks later, a majority of participants said \nthat they had probably or definitely visited the campus in the past. The participants misattributed information\nfrom one context— an image they’d seen— onto another— a memory of something\nthey believed they actually experienced. In another experiment, people were shown\nan image of a magnifying glass, and then told to imagine a lollipop. They frequently recalled that they saw \nthe magnifying glass and the lollipop. They struggled to link the objects \nto the correct context— whether they actually saw them,\nor simply imagined them. Another study, where a psychologist \nquestioned over 2,000 people on their views about the legalization \nof marijuana, highlights yet another kind \nof influence on memory. Participants answered questions \nin 1973 and 1982. Those who said they had supported\nmarijuana legalization in 1973, but reported they were against it in 1982, were more likely to recall that they were \nactually against legalization in 1973— bringing their old views in line \nwith their current ones. Our current opinions,\nfeelings, and experiences can bias our memories \nof how we felt in the past. In another study, researchers gave two groups\nof participants background information on a historical war and asked them to rate\nthe likelihood that each side would win. They gave each group the same information, except that they only told one group\nwho had actually won the war— the other group didn’t know \nthe real world outcome. In theory, both groups’ answers \nshould be similar, because the likelihood\nof each side winning isn’t effected by who actually won— if there’s a 20% chance of thunderstorms,\nand a thunderstorm happens, the chance of thunderstorms\ndoesn’t retroactively go up to 100%. Still, the group that knew \nhow the war ended rated the winning side as more likely \nto win than the group who did not. All of these fallibilities of memory \ncan have real-world impacts. If police interrogations use leading\nquestions with eye witnesses or suspects, suggestibility could result in incorrect \nidentifications or unreliable confessions. Even in the absence of leading questions, misattribution can lead to inaccurate \neyewitness testimony. In a courtroom, if a judge rules a piece of evidence \ninadmissible and tells jurors to disregard it,\nthey may not be able to do so. In a medical setting, if a patient \nseeks a second opinion and the second physician is aware \nof the first one’s diagnosis, that knowledge may bias their conclusion. Our memories are not ironclad \nrepresentations of reality, but subjective perceptions. And there’s not necessarily\nanything wrong with that— the problems arise when we treat\nmemory as fact, rather than accepting\nthis fundamental truth about the nature of our recollections. "

        "text": "Satan, the beast crunching sinners’ bones\nin his subterranean lair. Lucifer, the fallen angel raging \nagainst the established order. Mephistopheles, the trickster striking \ndeals with unsuspecting humans. These three divergent devils are all based\non Satan of the Old Testament, an angelic member of God’s court \nwho torments Job in the Book of Job. But unlike any of these literary devils, the Satan of the Bible was \na relatively minor character, with scant information about his deeds \nor appearance. So how did he become the ultimate \nantagonist, with so many different forms? In the New Testament, \nSatan saw a little more action: tempting Jesus,\nusing demons to possess people, and finally appearing as a giant dragon \nwho is cast into hell. This last image particularly inspired\nmedieval artists and writers, who depicted a scaled, shaggy-furred\ncreature with overgrown toenails. In Michael Pacher’s painting \nof St. Augustine and the Devil, the devil appears as an upright lizard— with a second miniature face \nglinting on his rear and. The epitome of these monster Satans appeared in Italian poet \nDante Alighieri’s “Inferno.” Encased in the ninth circle of hell, Dante’s Satan is a three-headed,\nbat-winged behemoth who feasts on sinners. But he’s also an object of pity: powerless as the panicked beating \nof his wings only encases him further in ice. The poem’s protagonist escapes from hell\nby clambering over Satan’s body, and feels both disgust and sympathy\nfor the trapped beast— prompting the reader to consider\nthe pain of doing evil. By the Renaissance, the devil started\nto assume a more human form. Artists painted him as a man \nwith cloven hooves and curling horns inspired by Pan,\nthe Greek god of the wild. In his 1667 masterpiece “Paradise Lost,” English poet John Milton depicted\nthe devil as Lucifer, an angel who started a rebellion \non the grounds that God is too powerful. Kicked out of heaven, \nthis charismatic rebel becomes Satan, and declares that he’d rather rule in hell\nthan serve in heaven. Milton’s take inspired numerous depictions\nof Lucifer as an ambiguous figure, rather than a purely evil one. Milton’s Lucifer later became an iconic\ncharacter for the Romantics of the 1800s, who saw him as a hero who defied higher\npower in pursuit of essential truths, with tragic consequences. Meanwhile, in the German legend \nof Doctor Faust, which dates to the 16th century, we get a look at what happens \nwhen the devil comes to Earth. Faust, a dissatisfied scholar, pledges his soul to the devil\nin exchange for bottomless pleasure. With the help \nof the devil’s messenger Mephistopheles, Faust quickly seizes \nwomen, power, and money— only to fall into the eternal fires \nof hell. Later versions of the story show\nMephistopheles in different lights. In Christopher Marlowe's account, a cynical Doctor Faustus is happy \nto strike a deal with Mephistopheles. In Johann Wolfgang van Goethe’s version, Mephistopheles tricks Faust\ninto a grisly deal. Today, a Faustian bargain refers \nto a trade that sacrifices integrity for short-term gains. In stagings of Goethe’s play, Mephistopheles appeared \nin red tights and cape. This version of the devil was often\nplayed as a charming trickster— one that eventually paraded \nthrough comic books, advertising, and film in his red suit. These three takes on the devil \nare just the tip of the iceberg: the devil continues to stalk \nthe public imagination to this day, tempting artists of all kinds \nto render him according to new and fantastical visions.

        "text": "In 1942, a mother-daughter duo Katherine Cook Briggs\nand Isabel Briggs Myers developed a questionnaire that classified\npeople’s personalities into 16 types. Called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,\nor MBTI, it would go on to become one of the world’s \nmost widely-used personality tests. Today, personality testing \nis a multi-billion dollar industry used by individuals, schools,\nand companies. But none of these tests, including \nthe MBTI, the Big Five, the DiSC assessment, \nthe Process Communication Model, and the Enneagram, actually reveal truths about personality. In fact, it’s up for debate \nwhether personality is a stable, measurable feature \nof an individual at all. Part of the problem is the way the tests\nare constructed. Each is based on a different set \nof metrics to define personality: the Myers-Briggs, for instance, focuses on features like introversion \nand extroversion to classify people into\npersonality \"types,\" while the Big Five scores participants\non five different traits. Most are self-reported, meaning the results are based on questions\nparticipants answer about themselves. So it’s easy to lie, but even with \nthe best intentions, objective self-evaluation is tricky. Take this question from the Big Five: How would you rate the accuracy\nof the statement \"I am always prepared\"? There’s a clear favorable answer here,\nwhich makes it difficult to be objective. People subconsciously aim to please: when asked to agree or disagree,\nwe show a bias toward answering however we believe \nthe person or institution asking the question wants us to answer. Here’s another question— what do you value more, \njustice or fairness? What about harmony or forgiveness? You may well value both sides \nof each pair, but the MBTI would force \nyou to choose one. And while it’s tempting to assume \nthe results of that forced choice must somehow reveal a true preference,\nthey don’t: When faced with the same forced choice\nquestion multiple times, the same person will sometimes\nchange their answer. Given these design flaws, it’s no surprise\nthat test results can be inconsistent. One study found that nearly half of people\nwho take the Myers-Briggs a second time only five weeks after the first\nget assigned a different type. And other studies on the Myers-Briggs have\nfound that people with very similar scores end up being placed \nin different categories, suggesting that the strict divisions\nbetween personality types don’t reflect real-life nuances. Complicating matters further, the definitions of personality traits \nare constantly shifting. The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who popularized the terms\nintrovert and extrovert, defined an introvert as someone who sticks\nto their principles regardless of situation, and an extrovert as someone who molds\ntheir self according to circumstance. Introversion later came to mean shyness,\nwhile an extrovert was someone outgoing. Today, an introvert is someone who finds\nalone time restorative, an extrovert draws energy \nfrom social interaction, and an ambivert falls somewhere\nbetween these two extremes. The notion of an innate, \nunchanging personality forms the basis of all these tests. But research increasingly suggests that\npersonality shifts during key periods— like our school years,\nor when we start working. Though certain features \nof a person’s behavior may remain relatively stable over time, others are malleable, moulded by our\nupbringing, life experiences, and age. All of this matters more or less depending\non how a personality test is used. Though anyone using them should take\nthe results with a grain of salt, there isn’t much harm in individual use— and users may even learn some \nnew terms and concepts in the process. But the use of personality tests extends\nfar beyond self discovery. Schools use them to advise students\nwhat to study and what jobs to pursue. Companies use them decide who to hire\nand for what positions. Yet the results don’t predict how a person\nwill perform in a specific role. So by using personality tests this way, institutions can deprive people \nof opportunities they’d excel at, or discourage them from considering \ncertain paths. "

As the Roman Empire \nflourished further south, Scandinavians had small settlements, \nno central government, and no coinage. Yet by the 11th century, the Vikings \nhad spread far from Scandinavia, gaining control of trade routes \nthroughout Europe, conquering kingdoms as far as Africa, and even building outposts \nin North America. The secret to their success \nwas their ships. The formidable Viking longship had its origins \nin the humble dugout canoe, or log boat. For millennia, the inhabitants of Scandinavia \nhad used these canoes for transportation. Dense forests and tall mountains \nmade overland travel difficult, but long coastlines \nand numerous rivers, lakes, and fjords provided a viable alternative. The first canoes were simply hollowed out \nlogs rowed with paddles. Over time, they added planks \nto the log boat base using the clinker, \nor \"lapstrake,\" technique, meaning the planks overlapped and were fastened to each other \nalong their edges. As the Roman Empire expanded north, some Scandinavians \nserved in their new neighbors’ armies— and brought home \nRoman maritime technology. The Mediterranean cultures \nat the heart of the Roman Empire had large warships \nthat controlled the sea, and cargo ships that transported goods \nalong the waterways. These ships were powered by sail and oars and relied on a strong skeleton \nof internal timbers fastened to the outer planks \nwith copper, iron, and wood nails. At first, Scandinavians \nincorporated this new technology by replacing their loose paddles \nwith anchored oars. This change \nhugely improved the crew’s efficiency, but also required stronger ships. So boat builders began to use iron nails \nfor fasteners rather than sewing. They abandoned \nthe log boat base for a keel plank, and the boats became higher \nand more seaworthy. But these early ships retained the concept\nof the original log boat: their strength \ndepended on the outer shell of wood, not internal frames and beams. They were built as shells— \nthin-walled but strong, and much lighter than the Roman ships. Competing chieftains quickly refined \nthe new ships to be even more efficient. The lighter the boat, \nthe more versatile it would be and the less investment of resources \nit would require— an essential advantage \nin a decentralized culture without large supplies of people. These ships still had no sails— \nsails were costly, and for now the rowed ships \ncould meet their needs. That changed \nafter the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century. Western Europe \ntook a heavy economic blow, leveling the playing field a bit \nfor the Scandinavians. As the region revived, new and vigorous trade routes \nextended into and through Scandinavia. The wealth that flowed along these routes helped create a new, more prosperous \nand powerful class of Scandinavians, whose members \ncompeted constantly with each other over trade routes and territory. By the 8th century, \na sailing ship began to make sense: it could go further, faster, \nin search of newly available plunder. With the addition of sails, the already light and speedy ships \nbecame nearly unbeatable. The Viking ship was born. Viking longships could soon carry \nas many as 100 Vikings to battle. Fleets of them \ncould land on open beaches, penetrate deep into river systems, \nand be moved over land if need be. When not at war, the vessels were used to transport goods \nand make trade journeys. There were smaller versions \nfor fishing and local excursions, and larger adaptations \nfor open sea voyages capable of carrying \ntens of tons of cargo. Thanks to their inventiveness \nin the face of difficult terrain and weak economies, \nthe Vikings sailed west, settled the North Atlantic \nand explored the North American coast centuries before any other Europeans \nwould set foot there.

        "text": "Over the course of our lifetimes, our bodies undergo a series \nof extraordinary metamorphoses: we grow, experience puberty, and many of us reproduce. Behind the scenes, the endocrine system works \nconstantly to orchestrate these changes. Alongside growth and sexual maturity, this system regulates everything \nfrom your sleep to the rhythm of your beating heart, exerting its influence over each \nand every one of your cells. The endocrine system relies \non interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and trillions of cell receptors. Firstly, there are several\nhormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body. Each is surrounded by \na network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients \nto manufacture dozens of hormones. Those hormones are then\npumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream. From there, each hormone needs \nto locate a set of target cells in order to bring about a specific change. To find its targets, \nit’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside \nor on the cell’s surface. Those receptors recognise\nspecific hormones as they waft by, and bind to them. When this happens, that hormone-receptor combination \ntriggers a range of effects that either increase or decrease \nspecific processes inside the cell to change the way that cell behaves. By exposing millions of cells at a time to hormones\nin carefully-regulated quantities, the endocrine system drives \nlarge-scale changes across the body. Take, for instance, the thyroid \nand the two hormones it produces, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones travel to most \nof the body’s cells, where they influence how quickly \nthose cells use energy and how rapidly they work. In turn, that regulates everything \nfrom breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion. Hormones also have some of their most\nvisible—and familiar—effects during puberty. In men, puberty begins when \nthe testes start secreting testosterone. That triggers the gradual development \nof the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice to deepen and height to increase. In women, estrogen secreted from the\novaries signals the start of adulthood. It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the womb’s lining, preparing the body \nfor menstruation or pregnancy. An enduring misconception around \nthe endocrine system is that there are exclusively male \nand female hormones. In fact, men and women \nhave estrogen and testosterone, just in different amounts. Both hormones play a role \nin pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones\nthat ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child. Such periods of hormonal change are also\nassociated with fluctuations in mood. That’s because hormones can influence the production of certain chemicals \nin the brain, like serotonin. When chemical levels shift,\nthey may cause changes in mood, as well. But that’s not to say that hormones \nhave unlimited power over us. They’re frequently viewed as the main \ndrivers of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects,\nespecially during puberty. But research shows that our behavior \nis collectively shaped by a variety of influences, including the brain \nand its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors. The primary function \nof the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes, \nnot control us. Sometimes disease, stress, and even diet can disrupt \nthat regulatory function, however, altering the quantity of hormones \nthat glands secrete or changing the way that cells respond. Diabetes is one of the most \ncommon hormonal disorders, occurring when the pancreas \nsecretes too little insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar levels. And hypo- and hyperthyroidism occur when the thyroid gland makes\ntoo little or too much thyroid hormone. When there’s too little thyroid hormone,\nthat results in a slowed heart rate, fatigue, and depression, and when there’s too much \nthyroid hormone, weight loss, sleeplessness, and irritability. But most of the time, the endocrine system manages to keep \nour bodies in a state of balance. And through its constant regulation, it drives the changes that ultimately\nhelp us become who we are. "

        "text": "In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng presented the Han court with \nhis latest invention. This large vase, he claimed, could tell them whenever an earthquake \noccurred in their kingdom– including the direction \nthey should send aid. The court was somewhat skeptical, especially when the device triggered \non a seemingly quiet afternoon. But when messengers came \nfor help days later, their doubts turned to gratitude. Today, we no longer rely on pots to \nidentify seismic events, but earthquakes still offer a unique\nchallenge to those trying to track them. So why are earthquakes so \nhard to anticipate, and how could we get better \nat predicting them? To answer that, we need to understand some theories \nbehind how earthquakes occur. Earth’s crust is made from several vast, \njagged slabs of rock called tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten\nlayer of Earth’s mantle. This causes the plates to \nspread very slowly, at anywhere from 1 to 20 \ncentimeters per year. But these tiny movements are powerful \nenough to cause deep cracks in the\ninteracting plates. And in unstable zones, the intensifying pressure may \nultimately trigger an earthquake. It’s hard enough to monitor these \nminiscule movements, but the factors that turn shifts into \nseismic events are far more varied. Different fault lines juxtapose \ndifferent rocks– some of which are stronger–or weaker–\nunder pressure. Diverse rocks also react differently to\nfriction and high temperatures. Some partially melt, and can release\nlubricating fluids made of superheated minerals that reduce fault line friction. But some are left dry, prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure. And all these faults are subject to \nvarying gravitational forces, as well as the currents of hot rocks\nmoving throughout Earth’s mantle. So which of these hidden variables \nshould we be analyzing, and how do they fit into our \ngrowing prediction toolkit? Because some of these forces occur \nat largely constant rates, the behavior of the plates \nis somewhat cyclical. Today, many of our most reliable clues \ncome from long-term forecasting, related to when and where earthquakes \nhave previously occurred. At the scale of millennia, this allows us to make predictions \nabout when highly active faults, like the San Andreas, are overdue for a massive earthquake. But due to the many variables involved, this method can only predict \nvery loose timeframes. To predict more imminent events, researchers have investigated the \nvibrations Earth elicits before a quake. Geologists have long used seismometers to track and map these tiny shifts\nin the earth’s crust. And today, most smartphones are \nalso capable of recording primary seismic waves. With a network of phones around the globe, scientists could potentially \ncrowdsource a rich, detailed warning system that alerts \npeople to incoming quakes. Unfortunately, phones might not be able\nto provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols. But such detailed readings \nwould still be useful for prediction tools like NASA’s \nQuakesim software, which can use a rigorous blend of \ngeological data to identify regions at risk. However, recent studies indicate the most telling signs of a quake might be\ninvisible to all these sensors. In 2011, just before an earthquake struck \nthe east coast of Japan, nearby researchers recorded surprisingly \nhigh concentrations of the radioactive isotope pair: \nradon and thoron. As stress builds up in the crust right \nbefore an earthquake, microfractures allow these gases \nto escape to the surface. These scientists think that if we built \na vast network of radon-thoron detectors in earthquake-prone areas, it could become a promising \nwarning system– potentially predicting quakes \na week in advance. Of course, none of these technologies \nwould be as helpful as simply looking deep inside \nthe earth itself. With a deeper view we might be able to track and predict large-scale \ngeological changes in real time, possibly saving tens of thousands \nof lives a year. But for now, these technologies can help us prepare \nand respond quickly to areas in need– without waiting for directions \nfrom a vase. "

She barely survived \nand was unable to reproduce. Could the next year bring\na change in luck? It's autumn and fat raindrops finally\ncome spilling from the sky. Within days, the platypus finds a river\nand begins to hunt. Her webbed feet propel her along and her waterproof coat\ntraps heat close to her body. Underwater, she senses her surroundings\nwith her duck-like bill, which is fitted with about 40,000\nelectroreceptors. This allows her to detect the minuscule\nelectrical signals coming from a glass shrimp’s \nnerves and muscles. She makes it a quick meal. And once she clambers back \non land to construct a burrow, she waddles in a lizard-like posture, her limbs moving horizontally \nto her spine. The platypus has many quirks. As a monotreme, she's part of the most\nancient lineage of mammals alive today. Consequently, she has a curious mix of\nmammalian, avian, and reptilian features, which is reflected in her genome. For instance, mammals usually have one\npair of chromosomes that determine sex. But the platypus has five, \nwhich more closely resemble a bird’s. Let's hope she gets to put them to use. She regains her strength and, \nas winter turns to spring, it’s time to mate. However, she can’t raise her young here. The surrounding land has\nbegun to be deforested, causing the riverbank to erode. Instead, she journeys upstream and settles in a clear, deep pool \nsheltered by a river red gum tree. Suddenly, a rustle flushes birds \nfrom the undergrowth and a fox appears. These predators have threatened platypuses ever since they were introduced \nto Australia by white settlers in 1855. The fox doesn’t see her this time,\nbut the platypus will need to stay alert. Two males also occupy this area and, \nsoon enough, they begin competing for her affections. Each has spurs on its hind legs containing\na potent snake-like venom. One male fights the other off \nand courts the female over several weeks, swimming alongside her, \nand occasionally biting her tail. Eventually, she reciprocates, and they swim around in circles \nbefore doing the deed. The male platypus has a penis\nwith eccentric features like two heads and spines \nthat aid and fertilization. Over the following week,\nthe female constructs an extensive burrow furnished with a cozy nest. She plugs up the tunnels leading in, making them appear as dead ends \nto potential predators. Then, much like a reptile or bird,\nshe lays eggs from her cloaca, a single opening that's used for both\nreproduction and excretion. She incubates her eggs, and as \nthe river red gum tree blooms, her offspring hatch. Like other mammals, she feeds them milk. But unlike other mammals, \nshe has no nipples. Instead, her milk oozes \nfrom mammary glands onto her belly, where her babies slurp it up. This pooled milk invites bacteria, but the platypus also produces \npotent antibacterial proteins, ensuring her newborns are safe. She continues nursing them\nfor four months— hunting, evading the fox, \nand repairing her burrow all the while. By the time her young are ready to make\ntheir debut, the summer is waning. One evening, after the female platypus\nreturns from hunting, she finds that one nestling has\nalready struck off on its own. A few days later, the other\nalso leaves the borough. Soon, her young are living\ncompletely independently. And eventually they’ll leave this part \nof the river to make homes of their own. "

        "text": "Just a minute ago, this oil helped make a delicious meal possible. But now, it's just some nasty goop. What should we do with it? Well, the easiest thing would be to pour it down the drain; that makes it seem like it's gone, but it's not really gone. Instead, it's collecting bits of food and other random stuff, producing monstrous, greasy blockages that clog not only your own drain but entire sewage systems, causing flooding and pollution. Many places have laws for proper disposal of grease, but we can go one step further. Instead of just throwing it away safely, we can turn it into something useful. And if you're wondering what anyone could possibly want with a bunch of digusting, used cooking oil, the answer is: biodiesel. You've probably heard of diesel engines. They power farming and construction equipment, trucks, buses, ships, trains, backup generators, and even some cars. Most of the fuel that feeds these engines is refined from petroleum, which comes from long-dead dinosaurs and other ancient fossils. But diesel fuel can also be derived from more recently-dead organisms, like plants and animals. And this type of fuel is what we call biodiesel. Biodiesel is a biodegradable energy source, made from plant oils or animal fats, that can usually be burned in regular diesel engines. You guessed it, it's the 'bio' version of diesel. It's cleaner than normal diesel, so there has been a push to generate it from crops like soybeans. Now, growing plants for fuel, instead of food, comes with its own problems. But fortunately, we already have some oils and fats right here. Preparing your used cooking grease for recycling is easy. First, let it cool down to room temperature. Then, transfer it to a clean container. You can use any old bottles you have lying around, like milk jugs, as long as they're completely empty, rinsed, and dried. Use a funnel to avoid spills and a sieve to filter out any small food particles. You can even add bacon grease and other animal fats or the excess oil from canned food, like tuna or sardines, just make sure it's really oil and not brine. So, what happens now that your oil is safely contained? Well, many cities have recycling services that will pick up large amounts of grease from restaurants and other establishments. But there are locations where individuals can drop off their containers, as well. All of this grease will end up at a processing plant, where it can be converted to useable biodiesel. How does this conversion work? Well, all these oils and fats you donated are made up of triglycerides, a glycerol molecule connected to three fatty acid chains. To convert fats to fuel, they react with an alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, which produces long-chain esters and glycerol. To compare, here are some molecules of regular diesel fuel. Now, here are the molecules we created by breaking apart the triglycerides. Glycerol is the odd man out, so it's removed at the end of the process. But look at these esters! If you squint, their structures look pretty similar to those of the long-chain hydrocarbons in regular diesel. And diesel engines, with a few small modifications, can also be made to squint and burn these esters like regular diesel fuel. Et voila! Biodiesel. Now, you might be wondering whether all this hassle over recycling used cooking oil is even worth it. After all, how much energy can it possibly generate? Well, if all the grease that New Yorkers throw away in one day were converted to jet fuel, it would be enough to power several hundred flights from New York to Los Angeles. And let's not forget that using waste oil instead of burning more fossil fuels will limit our negative effects on the environment. Recycling used cooking grease turns goop into good. By contributing a little bit, individuals and businesses can help create an alternative, stable source of diesel oil, while protecting the environment and keeping our cities cleaner. And that's pretty slick. "

        "text": "Every time you breathe in, \nair travels down the trachea, through a series of channels\ncalled bronchi, and finally reaches little clusters\nof air sacs called alveoli. There are some 600 million alveoli\nin the lungs, adding up to a surface area \nof roughly 75 square meters— the size of a tennis court. These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,\nfacilitate a crucial exchange: allowing oxygen from the air \nwe breathe into the bloodstream and clearing out carbon dioxide. Pneumonia wreaks havoc \non this exchange. Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli\nthat causes them to fill with fluid. There are many different kinds \nof pathogens that can cause pneumonia. The most common ones \nare viruses or bacteria. These microscopic invaders enter the body\nvia droplets either in the air we breathe, or when we touch our eyes, noses, or mouths after touching \na contaminated surface. Then, they face the respiratory tract’s\nfirst line defense: the mucociliary escalator. The mucociliary escalator consists of\nmucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs called cilia that carry the mucus toward\nthe mouth, where it can be coughed out. But some of these invaders \nmay get past the mucociliary escalator into the lungs,\nwhere they meet the alveoli. Because alveoli serve \nas critical exchange points between the blood and air \nfrom the outside world, they have their own specialized types\nof white blood cells, or macrophages, which defend against foreign organisms\nby enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,\nthe macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional\nwhite blood cells in the alveoli to help. As these immune cells fight the pathogens,\nthey generate inflammation— and fluid as a by-product \nof the inflammation. When this fluid builds up, it makes gas exchange inside \nthe alveoli much more difficult. As the level of carbon dioxide \nin the bloodstream begins to rise, the body breathes more quickly to try\nto clear it out and get more oxygen in. This rapid breathing is one of the most\ncommon symptoms of pneumonia. The body also tries to force the fluid out\nof the alveoli through coughing. Determining the cause of pneumonia \ncan be difficult, but once it is established, \ndoctors can prescribe antibiotics, which may include either antibacterial\nor antiviral treatments. Treatment with antibiotics helps \nthe body get the infection under control. As the pathogen is cleared out, the body gradually expels or absorbs\nfluid and dead cells. The worst symptoms typically fade out\nin about a week, though full recovery may take \nas long as a month. Otherwise healthy adults can often\nmanage pneumonia at home. But for some groups, pneumonia \ncan be a lot more severe, requiring hospitalization and oxygen,\nartificial ventilation, or other supportive measures \nwhile the body fights the infection. Smoking damages the cilia, making them less able to clear even\nthe normal amount of mucus and secretions, let alone the increased volume \nassociated with pneumonia. Genetic and autoimmune disorders can make someone more susceptible\nto pathogens that can cause pneumonia. Young children and the elderly \nalso have impaired clearance and weaker immune systems. And if someone has viral pneumonia, their risk of bacterial respiratory\ninfection is higher. Many of the deaths from pneumonia \nare due to lack of access to healthcare. But sometimes, even with appropriate care, the body enters a sustained fight against\nthe infection it can’t maintain, activating inflammatory pathways\nthroughout the body, not just in the lungs. This is actually a protective mechanism, but after too long in this state organs\nstart shutting down, causing shock and sometimes death. So how can we prevent pneumonia? Eating well and getting enough sleep\nand exercise helps your body fight off infections. Vaccines can protect against common \npneumonia-causing pathogens, while washing your hands regularly helps\nprevent the spread of these pathogens— and protect those most vulnerable\nto severe pneumonia.

        "text": "Imagine if half the people\nin your neighborhood, your city, or even your whole country were wiped out. It might sound like something out of \nan apocalyptic horror film, but it actually happened \nin the 14th century during a disease outbreak\nknown as the Black Death. Spreading from China through Asia,\nthe Middle East, Africa and Europe, the devastating epidemic destroyed \nas much as 1/5 of the world's population, killing nearly 50% of Europeans\nin just four years. One of the most fascinating\nand puzzling things abut the Black Death is that the illness itself\nwas not a new phenomenon but one that has affected\nhumans for centuries. DNA analysis of bone\nand tooth samples from this period, as well as an earlier epidemic known as\nthe Plague of Justinian in 541 CE, has revealed that both were caused\nby Yersinia pestis, the same bacterium that causes\nbubonic plague today. What this means is that the same disease\ncaused by the same pathogen can behave and spread \nvery differently throughout history. Even before the use of antibiotics,\nthe deadliest oubreaks in modern times, such as the ones that occurred\nin early 20th century India, killed no more than 3% of the population. Modern instances of plague\nalso tend to remain localized, or travel slowly,\nas they are spread by rodent fleas. But the medieval Black Death,\nwhich spread like wildfire, was most likely communicated directly\nfrom one person to another. And because genetic comparisons of ancient\nto modern strains of Yersinia pestis have not revealed any significantly\nfunctional genetic differences, the key to why the earlier outbreak\nwas so much deadlier must lie not in the parasite but the host. For about 300 years during\nthe High Middle Ages, a warmer climate\nand agricultural improvements had led to explosive population growth\nthroughout Europe. But with so many new mouths to feed, the end of this warm period spelled disaster. High fertility rates\ncombined with reduced harvest, meant the land could no longer \nsupport its population, while the abundant supply\nof labor kept wages low. As a result, most Europeans\nin the early 14th century experienced a steady decline\nin living standards, marked by famine, poverty and poor health,\nleaving them vulnerable to infection. And indeed, the skeletal remains\nof Black Death victims found in London show telltale signs of \nmalnutrition and prior illness. The destruction caused by the Black Death\nchanged humanity in two important ways. On a societal level,\nthe rapid loss of population led to important changes in\nEurope's economic conditions. With more food to go around, as well as more land and better pay\nfor the surviving farmers and workers, people began to eat better and live longer\nas studies of London cemeteries have shown. Higher living standards also brought\nan increase in social mobility, weakening feudalism,\nand eventually leading to political reforms. But the plague also had an important\nbiological impact. The sudden death of so many of\nthe most frail and vulnerable people left behind a population with\na significantly different gene pool, including genes that may have helped\nsurvivors resist the disease. And because such mutations \noften confer immunities to multiple pathogens \nthat work in similar ways, research to discover the genetic\nconsequences of the Black Death has the potential to be hugely beneficial. Today, the threat of an epidemic \non the scale of the Black Death has been largely eliminated \nthanks to antibiotics. But the bubonic plague continues to kill a\nfew thousand people worldwide every year, and the recent emergence of a \ndrug-resistant strain threatens the return of darker times. Learning more about the causes and effects\nof the Black Death is important, not just for understanding how\nour world has been shaped by the past. It may also help save us from \na similar nightmare in the future. "

        "text": "Communicating underwater is challenging. Light and odors don't travel well,\nso it's hard for animals to see or smell. But sound moves about four times\nfaster in water than in air, so in this dark environment, marine mammals often rely\non vocalization to communicate. That's why a chorus of sounds fills\nthe ocean. Clicks, pulses, whistles, groans, boings, cries, and trills, to name a few. But the most famous parts of this\nunderwater symphony are the evocative melodies, or songs,\ncomposed by the world's largest mammals, whales. Whale songs are one of the most\nsophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. Only a few species are known to sing. Blue, fin, bowhead minke whales, and of course humpback whales. These are all baleen whales which use hairy baleen plates\ninstead of teeth to trap their prey. Meanwhile, toothed whales do use\necholocation, and they and other species\nof baleen whales make social sounds, such as \ncries and whistles, to communicate. But those vocalizations \nlack the complexity of songs. So how do they do it? Land mammals like us generate sound\nby moving air over our vocal cords when we exhale,\ncausing them to vibrate. Baleen whales have a U-shaped fold\nof tissue between their lungs and their large inflatable organs\ncalled laryngeal sacs. We don't know this for sure because it's essentially impossible\nto observe the internal organs of a living, singing whale, but we think that when a whale sings, muscular contractions in the throat\nand chest move air from the lungs across\nthe U-fold and into the laryngeal sacs, causing the U-fold to vibrate. The resulting sound resonates in the sacs\nlike a choir singing in a cathedral making songs loud enough to propagate\nup to thousands of kilometers away. Whales don't have to exhale to sing. Instead, the air is recycled \nback into the lungs, creating sound once more. One reason whale songs are so fascinating\nis their pattern. Units, like moans, cries, and chirps\nare arranged in phrases. Repeated phrases \nare assembled into themes. Multiple themes repeated in a predictable\npattern create a song. This hierarchical structure \nis a kind of grammar. Whale songs are extremely variable\nin duration, and whales can repeat them over and over. In one recorded session,\na humpback whale sang for 22 hours. And why do they do it? We don't yet know the exact purpose,\nbut we can speculate. Given that the singers are males and \nthey mostly sing during the mating season, songs might be used to attract females. Or perhaps they're territorial,\nused to deter other males. Whales return to the same feeding\nand breeding grounds annually, and each discrete population has\na different song. Songs evolve over time as units\nor phrases are added, changed, or dropped. And when males from different populations\nare feeding within earshot, phrases are often exchanged, maybe because new songs make them more\nattractive to breeding females. This is one of the fastest examples\nof cultural transmission, where learned behaviors are passed\nbetween unrelated individuals of the same species. We can eavesdrop on these songs\nusing underwater microphones called hydrophones. These help us track species when sightings\nor genetic samples are rare. For example, scientists have been able\nto differentiate the elusive blue whale's populations\nworldwide based on their songs. But the oceans are getting noisier\nas a result of human activity. Boating, military sonar, underwater construction, and seismic surveys for oil\nare occurring more often which may interfere \nwith whale's communication. Some whales will avoid key feeding\nor breeding grounds if human noise is too loud. And humpback whales have been observed\nto reduce their singing in response to noise 200 kilometers away. Limiting human activity\nalong migratory routes and in other critical habitats, and reducing noise pollution\nthroughout the ocean would help ensure \nwhales continued survival. If the whales can keep singing\nand we can keep listening, maybe one day we'll truly understand\nwhat they're saying. "

        "text": "Death and taxes are famously inevitable,\nbut what about decomposition? As anyone who's seen a mummy knows, ancient Egyptians went to a lot of trouble\nto evade decomposition. So, how successful were they? Living cells constantly renew themselves. Specialized enzymes \ndecompose old structures, and the raw materials \nare used to build new ones. But what happens when someone dies? Their dead cells are no longer\nable to renew themselves, but the enzymes \nkeep breaking everything down. So anyone looking to preserve a body needed to get ahead of those enzymes\nbefore the tissues began to rot. Neurons die quickly, so brains were a lost cause\nto Ancient Egyptian mummifiers, which is why, according \nto Greek historian Herodotus, they started the process\nby hammering a spike into the skull, mashing up the brain, \nflushing it out the nose and pouring tree resins into the skull\nto prevent further decomposition. Brains may decay first,\nbut decaying guts are much worse. The liver, stomach and intestines\ncontain digestive enzymes and bacteria, which, upon death, start eating\nthe corpse from the inside. So the priests removed the lungs\nand abdominal organs first. It was difficult to remove the lungs\nwithout damaging the heart, but because the heart was believed\nto be the seat of the soul, they treated it with special care. They placed the visceral organs in jars filled with a naturally occurring salt\ncalled natron. Like any salt, natron can prevent decay \nby killing bacteria and preventing the body's natural\ndigestive enzymes from working. But natron isn't just any salt. It's mainly a mixture \nof two alkaline salts, soda ash and baking soda. Alkaline salts are especially\ndeadly to bacteria. And they can turn fatty membranes\ninto a hard, soapy substance, thereby maintaining \nthe corpse's structure. After dealing with the internal organs, the priest stuffed the body cavity\nwith sacks of more natron and washed it clean to disinfect the skin. Then, the corpse was set in a bed\nof still more natron for about 35 days \nto preserve its outer flesh. By the time of its removal, the alkaline salts \nhad sucked the fluid from the body and formed hard brown clumps. The corpse wasn't putrid, but it didn't exactly smell good, either. So, priests poured tree resin over\nthe body to seal it, massaged it with a waxy mixture\nthat included cedar oil, and then wrapped it in linen. Finally, they placed the mummy\nin a series of nested coffins and sometimes even a stone sarcophagus. So how successful were \nthe ancient Egyptians at evading decay? On one hand, mummies are definitely not\nintact human bodies. Their brains have been mashed up\nand flushed out, their organs have been removed\nand salted like salami, and about half of their remaining\nbody mass has been drained away. Still, what remains \nis amazingly well-preserved. Even after thousands of years, scientists can perform autopsies \non mummies to determine their causes of death, and possibly even isolate DNA samples. This has given us new information. For example, it seems that air pollution\nwas a serious problem in ancient Egypt, probably because of indoor fires \nused to bake bread. Cardiovascular disease was also common,\nas was tuberculosis. So ancient Egyptians were somewhat\nsuccessful at evading decay. Still, like death, taxes are inevitable. When some mummies were transported,\nthey were taxed as salted fish. "

        "text": "These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces\nof music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s \nSymphony Number Five premiered in 1808, \non a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part\nof a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily\nassembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,\nthe symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece \nto “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists\nthroughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues\nto move listeners today. So what exactly makes \nBeethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven\nalready had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively\nfor religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first\nfreelance composers. He made his living \ncomposing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions\nto an adoring public. This career choice gave him the \nflexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions \ninto music. At the time, most composers worked\nwithin the Classical style, which offered limited options \nfor a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most \nof his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps \nof role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he\nexperimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was\nknown for its expressive melodies, extended forms \nand surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth\nuses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea \nis explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores \na simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the \nbuilding block for most of the movement: three short notes, \nfollowed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would \nlater call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests\nthe figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed\nthe motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create\na gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates\nforward movement, while the prolonged fourth note \nsignals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts\nand rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens \nof variations, playing out across different \ninstruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed\naround the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more \ninstruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition \nis a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation \non display. This was the first major orchestral\ncomposition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs \na high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range \nthan most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics\nfurther heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has\na clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor \nand ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease\nto majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability \nto inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony \nwhile battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard \nin the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even\nafter he became completely deaf, producing innovative music\nuntil his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif \nhas continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol \nfor suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V \nin Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code \nfor victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can\nbe found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through\nmusical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners \nthrough a dark world, then guides them into the light. "

Misconceptions about everything \nfrom symptoms to treatment, make it difficult to navigate \nan eating disorder or support someone you love as they do so. So let’s walk through what is— \nand isn’t— true about eating disorders. First, what is an eating disorder? Eating disorders are a range \nof psychiatric conditions characterized by these main patterns \nof behavior: restricting food intake, bingeing, or\nrapidly consuming large amounts of food, and purging or eliminating calories through vomiting, laxatives, excessive \nexercise, and other harmful means. An eating disorder can involve any one \nor any combination of these behaviors. For example, people living with anorexia usually restrict the amount \nof food they eat, while bulimia nervosa \nis an eating disorder characterized by recurrent binges\nand purges. Importantly, these behaviors determine \nwhether someone has an eating disorder. You can’t tell whether someone has\nan eating disorder from their weight alone. People who weigh what medical\nprofessionals might consider a healthy range \ncan have eating disorders, including severe ones that damage \ntheir long-term health in invisible ways, including osteoporosis, anemia, \nheart damage, and kidney damage. Just as we can’t tell whether someone\nhas an eating disorder based on their weight alone, we can’t get rid of these disorders \nsimply by eating differently. That’s because eating disorders are,\nat their core, psychiatric illnesses. From what we understand, they involve a disruption\nto someone’s self-perception. Most people who experience them \nare severely critical of themselves and report many self-perceived flaws. They may use eating to try to regain \nsome control over an internal sense of chaos. We still don’t know exactly \nwhat causes eating disorders. There likely isn’t a single cause,\nbut a combination of genetic and environmental \nrisk factors that contribute. Sometimes, other mental illnesses—\nlike depression or anxiety— can cause symptoms of eating disorders. In addition, \ncertain psychological factors, such as perfectionism \nand body image dissatisfaction, are risk factors for eating disorders. Several social factors contribute, too, including internalized weight stigma,\nexposure to bullying, racial and ethnic assimilation, \nand limited social networks. Although there is a common misconception\nthat only women experience eating disorders, people of all genders can be affected. As these disorders intimately affect\nthe development of one’s identity and self-esteem, people are particularly vulnerable\nto developing them during adolescence. Although these are among the most \nchallenging psychiatric disorders to treat, effective therapies \nand interventions exist, and many people who receive treatment\nmake a full recovery. Treatment has a higher chance of success\nthe earlier it starts after someone develops \ndisordered eating behaviors. But unfortunately, less than half\nof people with an eating disorder will seek and receive treatment. Because of the complex effects\nof eating disorders on both the body and the mind, treatment usually includes a combination\nof nutritional counseling and monitoring, psychotherapy, and in some cases,\nmedications. Evidence-based psychotherapies exist \nas treatments for most eating disorders, including cognitive-behavioral therapy\nand family-based therapy. These are talk-therapies\nthat help people gain the skills to deal with underlying psychological \nproblems that drive eating disorder symptoms. Because not all patients will respond \nto these treatments, researchers are also investigating\ntreatments outside of psychotherapy, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Proper treatment can reduce the chances \nof dying from a severe eating disorder. Eating disorders can provoke \na powerful sense of powerlessness, but education for individuals,\nfamilies, and communities helps erode the stigma\nand improve access to treatment. "

Here she is, drawing a picture of herself in the atrium of her father's enormous house. Her name is Domitia, and she is just 5 years old. She has an older brother who is fourteen, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, named after her dad. Girls don't get these long names that boys have. What is worse is that Dad insists on calling all his daughters Domitia. \"Domitia!\" His call to Domitia drawing on the column, Domitia III. She has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old. And then there's Domitia I, who is ten. There would have been a Domitia IV, but mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago. Confused? The Romans were too. They could work out ancestry through the male line with the nice, tripartite names such as Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. But they got in a real mess over which Domitia was married to whom and was either the great aunt or the great stepmother and so on to whom when they came to write it down. Domitia III is not just drawing on the pillar, she's also watching the action. You see, it's early, in the time of day when all her dad's clients and friends come to see him at home to pay their respects. Lucius Popidius Secundus, a 17 year old, he wants to marry Domitia II within the next five to seven years, has come as well. He seems to be wooing not his future wife, but her dad. Poor Lucius, he does not know that Domitia's dad thinks he and his family are wealthy but still scumbags from the Subura. Afterall, it is the part of Rome full of barbers and prostitutes. Suddenly, all the men are leaving with Dad. It's the second hour and time for him to be in court with a sturdy audience of clients to applaud his rhetoric and hiss at his opponent. The house is now quieter. The men won't return for seven hours, not until dinner time. But what happens in the house for those seven hours? What do Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia do all day? Not an easy question! Everything written down by the Romans that we have today was written by men. This makes constructing the lives of women difficult. However, we can't have a history of just Roman men, so here it goes. We can begin in the atrium. There is a massive loom, on which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga. Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked with spinning the wool that will be used to weave this mighty garment, 30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape. Romans loved the idea that their wives work wool. We know that because it's written on the gravestones of so many Roman women. Unlike women in Greece, Roman women go out the house and move about the city. They go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men or to separate baths that are for women only. Some do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s: nude bathing with men present. Where they have no place is where the men are: in the Forum, in the Law Court, or in the Senate House. Their place in public is in the porticos with gardens, with sculpture, and with pathways for walking in. When Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia want to leave the house to go somewhere, like the Portico of Livia, they must get ready. Domitia II and Domitia III are ready, but Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married in two years to darling Philatus, isn't ready. She's not slow, she just has more to do. Being betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal: engagement rings and all the gifts Pilatus has given her - jewels, earrings, necklaces, and the pendants. She may even wear her myrtle crown. All this bling shouts, \"I'm getting married to that 19 year old who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!\" While as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls that mirror the image of their sister decked out to be married. One day, these dolls will be dedicated to the household gods on the day of their wedding. Okay, we're ready. The girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves. They also have a chaperone with them and will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia. Carried high on the shoulders of these slaves, the girls look out through the curtains to see the crowded streets below them. They traverse the city, pass the Coliseum, but then turn off to climb up the hill to the Porticus of Livia. It was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus, on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio. He wasn't such a great guy. He once tried to feed a slave to the eels in his fish pond for simply dropping a dish. Luckily, the emperor was at the dinner and tamed his temper. The litters are placed on the ground and the girls get out and arm in arm, two by two, they ascend the steps into the enclosed garden with many columns. Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column. Domitia II joins her but seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column. She spots a drawing of gladiators and tries to imagine seeing them fighting, something she will never be permitted to do, except from the very rear of the Coliseum. From there, she will have a good view of the 50,000 spectators but will see little by way of blood and gore. If she really wanted a decent view, she could become a vestal virgin and would sit right down the front. But a career tending the sacred flame of Vesta is not to everybody's taste. Domitia I has met another ten year old also decked out in the insignia of betrothal. Home time. When they get there after the eighth hour, something is up. A smashed dish lies on the floor. All the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium and await the arrival of their master. Dad is going to go mad. He will not hit his children, but like many other Romans, he believes that slaves have to be punished. The whip lies ready for his arrival. No one knows who smashed the dish, but Dad will call the undertaker to torture it out of them, if he must. The doorkeeper opens the front door to the house. A hush comes over the anxious slaves. In walks not their master but, instead, a pregnant teenager. It is the master's eldest daughter, age 15, who is already a veteran of marriage and child birth. Guess what her name is. There is a five to ten percent chance she won't survive giving birth to her child, but, for now, she has come to dinner with her family. As a teenage mother, she has proved that she is a successful wife by bringing children and descendants for her husband, who will carry on his name in the future. The family head off to the dining room and are served dinner. It would seem Dad has had an invite to dinner elsewhere. With dinner concluded, the girls crossed the atrium to bid farewell to their older sister who is carried home in a litter, escorted by some of Dad's bodyguards. Returning to the house, the girls cross the atrium. The slaves, young and old, male and female, await the return of their owner. When he returns, he may exact vengeance, ensuring his power over the slaves is maintained through violence and terror, to which any slave could be subjected. But, for the girls, they head upstairs for the night, ready for bed. "

        "text": "When it was ratified in 1789, the U.S. Constitution didn't just\ninstitute a government by the people. It provided a way for the people to alter\nthe constitution itself. And yet, of the nearly 11,000 amendments\nproposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. So what is it that makes the Constitution\nso hard to change? In short, its creators. The founders of the United States\nwere trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies, which needed assurance that their \nagreements couldn't be easily undone. So here's what they decided. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive \na two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress, or a request from two-thirds \nof state legislatures to call a national convention, and that's just the first step. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified\nby three-quarters of all states. To do this, each state can either have\nits legislature vote on the amendment, or it can hold a separate \nratification convention with delegates elected by voters. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, \nthe American Constitution is quite static. Most other democracies pass amendments\nevery couple of years. The U.S., on the other hand, \nhasn't passed one since 1992. At this point, you may wonder how any\namendments managed to pass at all. The first ten, \nknown as the Bill of Rights, includes some of America's \nmost well-known freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, and the right to a fair trial. These were passed all at once to resolve some conflicts from \nthe original Constitutional Convention. Years later, the Thirteenth Amendment,\nwhich abolished slavery, as well as the Fourteenth \nand Fifteenth Amendments, only passed after a bloody civil war. Ratifying amendments \nhas also become harder as the country has grown larger\nand more diverse. The first ever proposed amendment, a formula to assign \ncongressional representatives, was on the verge of ratification\nin the 1790s. However, as more and more states\njoined the union, the number needed to reach \nthe three-quarter mark increased as well, leaving it unratified to this day. Today, there are many \nsuggested amendments, including outlawing \nthe burning of the flag, limiting congressional terms, or even repealing the Second Amendment. While many enjoy strong support,\ntheir likelihood of passing is slim. Americans today are the most politically\npolarized since the Civil War, making it nearly impossible to reach\na broad consensus. In fact, the late Supreme Court Justice\nAntonin Scalia once calculated that due to America's\nrepresentative system of government, it could take as little as 2% of the total\npopulation to block an amendment. Of course, the simplest solution would be\nto make the Constitution easier to amend by lowering the thresholds required\nfor proposal and ratification. That, however, would require \nits own amendment. Instead, historical progress has mainly\ncome from the U.S. Supreme Court, which has expanded its interpretation\nof existing constitutional laws to keep up with the times. Considering that Supreme Court justices\nare unelected and serve for life once appointed, this is far from \nthe most democratic option. Interestingly, the founders themselves\nmay have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote \nthat laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed\nor repealed since every political process \nis full of obstacles that distort the will of the people. Although he believed that the basic principles \nof the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs\nto the living, and not to the dead. "

        "text": "During a long day spent roaming the forest\nin search of edible grains and herbs, the weary divine farmer Shennong\naccidentally poisoned himself 72 times. But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor \nof agriculture, highlights tea's importance \nto ancient China. Archaeological evidence suggests tea\nwas first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built\nthe Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's grown \naround the world today, yet it was originally consumed\nvery differently. It was eaten as a vegetable\nor cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food\nto drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination\nof heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste\nout of the leafy green. After hundreds of years of variations\nto the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage \ncalled muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct\nChinese tea culture emerged. Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures\nin the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art\nyou might see in coffee shops today. In the 9th century \nduring the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first\ntea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed\ntheir own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation \nof the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century \nduring the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor \nshifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes\nto loose leaf tea. At that point, China still held a\nvirtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea one of three \nessential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk. This gave China a great deal of power\nand economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world. That spread began in earnest\naround the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe\nin large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza,\na Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with\nthe English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the\nmidst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew,\ninterest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times\nthe price of coffee and the plant was still \nonly grown in China. The tea trade was so lucrative that the world's fastest sailboat, \nthe clipper ship, was born out of intense competition\nbetween Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea\nback to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid\nfor all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea \nfor another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem\nwithin China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official \nordered his men to destroy massive \nBritish shipments of opium as a statement against \nBritain's influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War\nbetween the two nations. Fighting raged up and down \nthe Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded\nthe port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China's global standing\nfor over a century. The British East India company also\nwanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned \nbotanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China \nin a covert operation. He disguised himself \nand took a perilous journey through China's mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees \nand experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. From there, \nthe plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth\nas an everyday commodity. Today, tea is the second most consumed\nbeverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways\nof preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.

        "text": "On a small island in the middle\nof the Irish Sea, fortresses preside over the rugged shores. This unlikely location\nwas the birthplace of a medieval empire that lasted 200 years,\nruled by a dynasty of sea kings. The first of these kings\nwas Godred Crovan, a notorious warlord descended \nfrom Irish and Viking rulers. Starting in 1079, \nGodred consolidated power over the Isle of Man and the Hebrides, a collection of islands\noff the west coast of Scotland. He seized control of important \nsea routes between the British Isles, Scandinavia, and the North Atlantic. A turbulent period followed\nGodred’s death, characterised by invasions\nfrom Norway and Ireland, and intense feuding between princes. But his descendants held on to power, building coastal fortresses,\nroving the seaways, throwing themselves into epic battles, and consolidating control \nover an impressive maritime kingdom. The inhabitants of this kingdom had\nboth Gaelic and Norse roots, and many probably spoke both languages. Those on the Isle of Man were\nknown as the Manx people, while those in the Hebrides were known\nas Islanders or People of the Isles. Though we still don’t know \nfor sure how many there were, we do know this relatively small group\nhad an outsize impact on the region. Perched on cliffs with sweeping views \nand safe harbors, seaside fortresses helped the kings\ncontrol shipping, commerce, and resources. The empire commanded vast fleets\nof Viking-style long ships, which they used for trading, raiding,\nand plundering the seas. Observing this prowess, \nmany neighboring rulers sought their aid. The brothers Rognvald and Olaf \neach solved neighbors’ maritime woes: King Rognvald supplied\nmilitary assistance to the Scottish king, and King Olaf’s forces \nserved as a Coast Guard at the English King Henry III’s request—\nfor a hefty fee. The sea kings also sparred \nwith their powerful neighbors, but they had a particularly bitter rivalry\nwith another dynasty in their own isles: a line of rulers in the Hebrides. In the 1150s, a chieftain of this line,\nSomerled, defeated the Manx King, \nhis brother-in-law, in a naval battle and formed a rival Kingdom of the Isles,\nfracturing the old kingdom. This began a century-long rivalry\nbetween Somerled’s line, who ruled the southern \nand central Hebrides, and the Manx Kings, who ruled \nthe Isle of Man and northern Hebrides, to control the seaways. Family feuds often blossomed\ninto bitter civil wars. In 1223, King Rognvald sent \na letter to his son commanding him to murder \nhis uncle Olaf. When Olaf discovered the plot, he launched\na vicious attack on his nephew, blinding and mutilating him. After Rognvald’s death \nseveral years later, people realized the letter ordering \nthe attack might have been forged. The Manx kings attempted to resolve \ndisagreements at Tynwald, an open-air parliament \ncentered on a mound, where assemblies ruled on matters \nof justice and other issues. Such sites were commonly used\nin the Viking world for resolving anything from local disputes\nto matters involving kings. These meetings didn’t always go smoothly— sometimes violence erupted, and in 1237, two rival factions squabbled \nto the point of breaking up the assembly at Tynwald. The four-tiered mound at Tynwald \nsurvives to this day, and the modern Manx parliament\nstill holds an annual meeting there. In 1248, King Harald of Man\ndied in a shipwreck and was succeeded by his brother. Weeks into the new king’s reign, \na rebel knight assassinated him. His brother Magnus died in 1265 \nat Castle Rushen— without an heir. According to one scribe, his death marked \nthe day that “kings ceased to reign in Man.” Scotland annexed Man and the Isles \nthe next year, in 1266. We know about the exploits of the \nsea kings primarily from a chronicle written by Christian scribes living \non the Isle of Man, and from the praise poems composed \nto celebrate the kings’ victories. Today, although the sea kings\nare long gone, their presence remains etched\nonto the landscape. "

If it wasn't blinking, then you've had\nthe distinct pleasure of seeing one of mankind's greatest \ncollaborative feats with your own eyes: The International Space Station. Roughly the size of six-bedroom house,\nand weighing more than 320 cars, the International Space Station \nis so large that no single rocket could have \nlifted it into orbit. Instead, it was assembled piece by piece while hurtling through space\nat 28,000 kilometers per hour, lapping the Earth once every 90 minutes. It all started when sixteen nations signed the Space Station \nIntergovernmental Agreement, laying out each partner's \nexpected contributions to the ISS, from modules and maintenance\nto sharing information and finances. At an estimated 100 billion U.S. dollars, the Space Station would be\nthe most expensive object ever built. The whole world watched as a Russian rocket launched \nthe first module of the ISS into the sky. Zarya, meaning sunrise, \nwas equipped with two solar panels and a propulsion system \nthat had the important task of keeping the young station \nfrom crashing into the Earth by staying a safe 400 kilometers away. The U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour\nfollowed two weeks later carrying Unity, a node module to which\nother modules could be connected, and an international \nsix-person assembly crew. Then came Zvezda, which brought\ncommunications and living accommodations. Ever since the International \nSpace Station's first tenants arrived, it's been continually occupied with more than 200 visitors spending \nan average of six months on board. Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti \nholds the record for the longest single space flight\nby a woman at 199 days on the ISS. 2001 saw the arrival of Destiny,\nthe first of four research modules, where astronauts spend\napproximately 36 hours a week conducting extraordinary experiments\nin microgravity. Their schedules are packed with exercise, two hours a day to fend off \nmuscle atrophy, station maintenance and repair, and connecting with family \nor awe-inspired minds around the world. But they still find time for fun,\nwith regular movie nights and even shooting \nthe first music video in space. Destiny also controls the seven-jointed\nrobotic Canadarm2. Capable of moving \nmore than 100,000 kilograms, it's perfect for unloading \nnew arrivals from shuttles. 2001 was a busy year for the Space Station\nwith the addition of Quest, the main airlock for strolls outside, and Pirs, a pier for Russian \nspacecrafts to dock including the ever-ready \nemergency escape vehicle, Soyuz. Then, on February 1st, 2003, after delivering \nresearch modules to the ISS, the space shuttle\nColumbia exploded during reentry tragically killing \nthe seven-member crew on board. After a four-year hiatus, work quickly\npicked up pace with the addition of more hubs, \nairlocks, docks, and an observation cupola for stunning\n360-degree views of our world and beyond. Other critical components included \nplatforms and trusses to support radiators that direct all the heat generated\nby the station's electronics into space and solar panels that are efficient enough\nto power 55 homes. It took ten years and over 30 missions, but finally, the International \nSpace Station was complete, coinciding with the U.S. Space \nShuttle Program's retirement. The Space Station continues to serve\nas an incredible model for international collaboration. This year, two people \nbegan a one-year stay on the ISS, allowing scientists to study the long-term\nphysical and psychological effects of being in space, which would prove useful for increasingly\nambitious space travel, like trips to Mars. Over its lifetime, we've learned \nan immense amount scientifically, but also about \nour capacity to work together and accomplish truly remarkable acts. "

The Peloponnesian War is being fought between the city-states of Athens and\nSparta, as well as their allies. The Athenians can’t match the formidable \nSpartan army on land. So they’ve abandoned the countryside and moved inside the walls surrounding \ntheir city and port, now provisioned by a superior fleet \nand extensive maritime empire. The cramped conditions have taken a toll and a recent plague wiped out \na third of the population. But city life goes on. Archias and Dexileia live \nin the center of Athens. As a painter of high-class pottery, Archias is relatively well-off and takes \ngreat interest in the city’s affairs. Dexileia, on the other hand, can't\nparticipate in politics or own property. The couple are grateful to the gods that \nthree of their four children, a son and two daughters, have survived past infancy. Many parents see daughters as a liability since they require dowries \nto find husbands. But Archias is confident that his wealth will allow him to make good matches\nfor them without going bankrupt. Like many Athenians, \nthe family owns slaves. Originally from Thrace,\nthey were captured in war. Thratta does most of the housework \nand helps raise the children. Philon is a paidagôgos, who supervises the son’s education, \nteaching him reading and writing. Archias is up early because there’s \na meeting of the Ekklêsia, the assembly of citizens, taking place at dawn. Before setting out, he burns incense and pours a libation at the small shrine \nin the courtyard on behalf of his entire household. Dexileia will remain at home all day, \nteaching her daughters domestic skills. Later, she’ll retire to the inner \ncourtyard for some fresh air. When Archias arrives at the agora, the civic and commercial heart \nof the city, he finds the square swarming \nwith his fellow citizens, native-born adult males who \nhave completed military training. Attached to the central monument is \na noticeboard with the meeting’s agenda. Today, there’s only one item \nof discussion: what to do with the people of Mytilene, a city on the island of Lesbos where a revolt against Athenian rule \nhas just been put down. The meeting takes place on a hill west \nof the acropolis known as the Pnyx. The word means “tightly packed,\" and the crowd of 5,000 citizens \nmakes it clear why. The heralds purify the hill by sprinkling \nits boundary with pig’s blood and call for order. As everyone sits on benches \nfacing the platform, the presiding officer opens the meeting \nwith the words: “Tis agoreuein bouleutai?” “Who wishes to address the assembly?” One by one, citizens speak, some advising \nmercy, others bent on vengeance. A motion is proposed to execute \nall the Mytileneans and enslave their women and children because they betrayed their Athenian \nallies during a time of war. A majority raises their right hands \nin favor. Once the meeting’s over, Archias heads \nback to the agora to buy food and wine. Hundreds have gathered there \nto discuss the results, many unhappy with the decision. When Archias returns home, \nhe tells Dexileia about the debate. She thinks that killing the innocent \nas well as the guilty is harsh and counterproductive, and tells him as much. Around dusk, Archias goes to \na friend’s house for a symposium. The nine men drink wine and\ndiscuss the meeting well into the night. Archias shares his wife’s opinion urging \nmercy, and his friends eventually agree. Before dawn, something \nunprecedented happens. Heralds circulate throughout Athens announcing the council \nhas called another meeting. The second debate is equally heated, but a new resolution, \nto execute only the leaders of the revolt, narrowly passes. Yet there’s a problem – a ship with orders to carry out \nthe first resolution was dispatched the previous day. And so another ship quickly sets sail \nto countermand the order – a race of democracy against time. "

        "text": "It can strike without warning,\nat any moment. You may be walking across a soft carpet\nand reaching for the door knob when suddenly...zap! To understand static electricity, we first need to know a bit\nabout the nature of matter. All matter is made up of atoms that consist of three \ntypes of smaller particles: negatively charged electrons, positively charged protons, and neutral neutrons. Normally, the electrons and protons\nin an atom balance out, which is why most matter you come across\nis electrically neutral. But electrons are tiny \nand almost insignificant in mass, and rubbing or friction can give\nloosely bound electrons enough energy to leave their atoms\nand attach to others, migrating between different surfaces. When this happens, the first object is left \nwith more protons than electrons and becomes positively charged, while the one with more electrons\naccumulates a negative charge. This situation is called\na charge imbalance, or net charge separation. But nature tends towards balance, so when one of these newly charged bodies\ncomes into contact with another material, the mobile electrons \nwill take the first chance they get to go where they're most needed, either jumping off the negatively\ncharged object, or jumping onto \nthe positively charged one in an attempt to restore \nthe neutral charge equilibrium. And this quick movement of electrons,\ncalled static discharge, is what we recognize as that sudden spark. This process doesn't happen \nwith just any objects. Otherwise you'd be getting \nzapped all the time. Conductors like metals and salt water tend to have loosely \nbound outer electrons, which can easily flow between molecules. On the other hand, insulators \nlike plastics, rubber and glass have tightly bound electrons\nthat won't readily jump to other atoms. Static build-up is most likely to occur when one of the materials involved\nis an insulator. When you walk across a rug, electrons from your body\nwill rub off onto it, while the rug's insulating wool\nwill resist losing its own electrons. Although your body and the rug\ntogether are still electrically neutral, there is now a charge polarization\nbetween the two. And when you reach to touch the door knob, zap! The metal door knob's loosely \nbound electrons hop to your hand to replace the electrons \nyour body has lost. When it happens in your bedroom,\nit's a minor nuisance. But in the great outdoors, static electricity can be a terrifying,\ndestructive force of nature. In certain conditions,\ncharge separation will occur in clouds. We don't know exactly how this happens. It may have to do with the circulation\nof water droplets and ice particles within them. Regardless, the charge \nimbalance is neutralized by being released towards another body, such as a building, the Earth, or another cloud in a giant spark\nthat we know as lightning. And just as your fingers can be zapped\nover and over in the same spot, you better believe that lightning \ncan strike the same place more than once. "

        "text": "Escaping slavery; risking everything to save her family; leading a military raid; championing the cause \nof women’s suffrage; these are just a handful \nof the accomplishments of one of America’s most\ncourageous heroes. Harriet Tubman was born Araminta Ross\nin Dorchester County, Maryland, in the early 1820s. Born into chattel slavery, Araminta, \nor Minty, was the fifth of nine children. Two of Minty’s older sisters \nwere sold to a chain gang. Even as a small child, Minty was hired out to different owners, who subjected her to whippings \nand punishment. Young Minty’s life changed forever \non an errand to a neighborhood store. There, an overseer threw a two-pound \nweight at a fugitive enslaved person, missed, and struck Minty instead. Her injury caused her \nto experience sleeping spells, which we know of today as narcolepsy, for the rest of her life. Minty’s owner tried to sell her, but there were no buyers for an enslaved \nperson who fell into sleeping spells. She was instead put to work \nwith her father, Ben Ross, who taught her how to lumber. Lumbering increased \nMinty’s physical strength and put her in touch with free black \nsailors who shipped the wood to the North. From them, Minty learned about \nthe secret communications that occurred along trade routes, information that would prove \ninvaluable later in her life. In this mixed atmosphere of free \nand enslaved blacks working side by side, Minty met John Tubman, \na free black man she married in 1844. After marriage, she renamed herself \nHarriet, after her mother. Harriet Tubman’s owner died in 1849. When his widow planned to sell \noff her enslaved human beings, Harriet feared she would be sold away \nfrom everyone she loved. She had heard of \nan “underground railroad,\" a secret network of safe houses, boat captains, and wagon drivers willing to harbor fugitive enslaved people\non their way north. So Tubman fled with two of her brothers, \nBen and Harry. They eventually turned back, \nfearing they were lost. But in one of her sleeping spells, Harriet dreamed \nthat she could fly like a bird. Looking down below, \nshe saw the path to liberation. And in the autumn of 1849, \nshe set out on her own, following the North Star to Pennsylvania, \nand to freedom. Tubman returned to the South \n13 times to free her niece, brothers, parents, and many others. She earned the nickname Black Moses and worked diligently \nwith fellow abolitionists to help enslaved people escape, first to the North, and later to Canada. Harriet Tubman worked \nas a Union army nurse, scout, and spy during the Civil War. In 1863, she became the first woman \nin United States history to plan and lead a military raid, liberating nearly \n700 enslaved persons in South Carolina. After the war, the 13th Amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution legally abolished slavery, while the 14th expanded citizenship and the 15th gave voting rights \nto formerly enslaved black men. But she was undaunted, and she persisted. She raised funds \nfor formerly enslaved persons and helped build schools \nand a hospital on their behalf. In 1888, Tubman became more active\nin the fight for women’s right to vote. In 1896, she appeared \nat the founding convention of the National Association \nof Colored Women in Washington D.C. and later at a woman’s suffrage \nmeeting in Rochester, New York. There she told the audience: “I was a conductor \non the Underground Railroad, and I can say what many others cannot. I never ran my train off the track, \nand I never lost a passenger.” As her fame grew, various friends and allies \nhelped her in the fight to collect a veteran’s pension \nfor her service in the Union Army. In 1899, she was finally \ngranted $20 a month. In a fitting twist of fate, the United States \nTreasury announced in 2016 that Tubman’s image will appear \non a redesigned twenty dollar bill. Harriet Tubman died on March 10, 1913. Even on her deathbed at age 91, she kept the freedom \nof her people in mind. Her final words were: \"I go away to prepare a place for you.” "

        "text": "In 1165, copies of a strange letter began \nto circulate throughout Western Europe. It spoke of a fantastical realm, containing the Tower of Babel \nand the Fountain of Youth— all ruled over by the letter’s \nmysterious author: Prester John. Today, we know that this extraordinary\nking never existed. But the legend of this mythical kingdom \nand its powerful ruler would impact the decisions of European\nleaders for the next 400 years. Prester John’s myth would propel \nthe age of exploration, inspire intercontinental diplomacy, \nand indirectly begin a civil war. When Prester John’s letter appeared, \nEurope was embroiled in the Crusades. In this series of religious wars, Europeans campaigned to seize what \nthey regarded as the Christian Holy Land. The Church vilified any faith \noutside of Christianity, including that of the Jewish and Muslim \ncommunities populating the region. Crusaders were eager to find Christian\nkingdoms to serve as allies in their war. And they were particularly interested\nin rumors of a powerful Christian king who had defeated an enormous \nMuslim army in the Far East. In fact, it was a Mongol horde including\nconverted Christian tribes that had routed the army. But news of this victory \ntraveled unreliably. Merchants and emissaries filled \ngaps in the story with epic poems and Biblical fragments. By the time the story reached Europe, the Mongol horde had been replaced\nwith a great Christian army, commanded by a king who shared \nthe Crusader’s vision of marching on Jerusalem. And when a letter allegedly written by \nthis so-called “Prester John” appeared, European rulers were thrilled. While the letter’s actual author \nremains unknown, its stereotypes about the East \nand alignment with European goals indicate it was a Western forgery. But despite the letter’s obvious origins \nas European propaganda, the appeal of Prester John’s myth \nwas too great for the Crusaders to ignore. Before long, European mapmakers were guessing \nthe location of his mythical kingdom. In the 13th and 14th centuries, \nEuropean missionaries went East, along the newly revived Silk Road. They weren’t searching for \nthe letter’s author, who would have been over a century old; \nbut rather, for his descendants. The title of Prester John \nwas briefly identified with several Central Asian rulers, but it soon became clear that the Mongols\nwere largely non-Christian. And as their Empire began to decline, Europeans began pursuing alternate routes \nto the Far East, and new clues to Prester John’s location. At the same time these explorers \nwent south, Ethiopian pilgrims began traveling north. In Rome, these visitors \nquickly attracted the interest of European scholars and cartographers. Since Ethiopia had been converted \nto Christianity in the 4th century, the stories of their African homeland \nfit perfectly into Prester John’s legend. Portuguese explorers scoured Africa \nfor the kingdom, until a mix of confusion and diplomacy \nfinally turned myth into reality. The Ethiopians graciously received \ntheir European guests, who were eager to do business \nwith the ruler they believed to be Prester John. Though the Ethiopians were initially \nconfused by the Portuguese’s unusual name for their Emperor, they were savvy enough to recognize \nthe diplomatic capital it afforded them. The Ethiopian diplomats played the part \nof Prester John’s subjects, and the Portuguese triumphantly announced\nan alliance with the fabled sovereign— over 350 years after the European \nletter had begun the search. But this long-awaited partnership \nwas quickly tested. A decade later, the Sultanate of Adal, a regional power supported \nby the Ottoman Empire, invaded Ethiopia. The Portuguese sent troops that helped \nEthiopians win this conflict. But by this time, it was clear that Ethiopia was not \nthe powerful ally Europe had hoped. Worse still, the increasingly intolerant \nRoman Catholic Church now deemed the Ethiopian sect \nof Christianity heretical. Their subsequent attempts to convert \nthe people they once revered as ideal Christians would eventually spark a civil war, and in the 1630s, \nEthiopia cut ties with Europe. Over the next two centuries, the legend of Prester John \nslowly faded into oblivion— ending the reign of a king who made \nhistory despite having never existed. "

        "text": "After the California Gold Rush of 1848, white settlers streamed west\nto strike it rich. In addition to precious metals, \nthey unearthed another treasure: dinosaur bones. Two wealthy scientists in particular— Othniel Charles Marsh \nand Edward Drinker Cope— competed to uncover these\nprehistoric monsters. Marsh and Cope were first to describe\niconic creatures like Brontosaurus, Triceratops, \nand Stegosaurus. But they also showcased the destructive\nwhirlwind of profiteering and ambition that fueled American science\nduring the late 1800s. Their rivalry, one of the most notorious\nscientific feuds in history, became known as the Bone Wars. Marsh was ill-tempered and had \na knack for debunking falsehoods. One woman said that getting to know him\nwas “like running against a pitchfork.” Cope, on the other hand, was charismatic\nand given to bold theorizing. But he was also sarcastic\nand temperamental. By his own admission, he wasn’t “constructed for getting along comfortably\nwith the general run of people.” When Marsh and Cope first met in 1864,\nthey were friendly, and each named a new species \nin the other’s honor. But their relationship soon soured. In 1868, Cope took Marsh to a quarry\nnear his home in New Jersey where one of the most complete dinosaur\nskeletons to date had recently been discovered. Sensing an opportunity, \nMarsh paid the mine operators to send him the most interesting \nnew finds. Outraged, Cope accused Marsh of bribery. That same year, Cope showed Marsh\nhis reconstruction of a new marine reptile called Elasmosaurus. Marsh immediately noticed \nthat something was wrong: Cope had mistaken the creature’s\nlong neck for its tail. When Cope's mentor sided with Marsh,\nCope was mortified. He tried to buy and destroy every copy \nof the article containing his blunder, but to no avail. Their mutual resentment blossomed. After the transcontinental railroad\nwas completed the following year, Cope and Marsh began scouring \nthe American West for fossils. They found riches the likes \nof which neither had dreamed. Relying on the help of Native American \nguides, Marsh made some especially\nsignificant discoveries, like ancient birds with teeth\nthat are still celebrated as a missing link between dinosaurs\nand modern birds. Cope made important discoveries, too, but Marsh successfully invalidated \nmany of them, showing them to be redundant \nwith other known species. Enraged, Cope tried to secure priority \nfor new findings by announcing them via telegram. He even purchased a respected journal so future publications could\nbe rushed into print. But Marsh used his personal fortune\nto gain the upper hand, hiring a small army of fossil hunters\nto out-compete his rival. In 1878, Marsh bought an especially\npromising quarry in Como Bluff, Wyoming, from two frontier collectors. It yielded tons of fossils, including the near-complete skeleton \nof a gigantic dinosaur that Marsh named Brontosaurus. Over the next 10 years, his men shipped \nhim more than 480 boxes of dinosaur bones from Como alone. Marsh named dozens of new species. But his assistants could be ruthless \nin their quest to further Marsh’s scientific ambitions. They sometimes destroyed fossils \njust to prevent them from falling into Cope’s hands. Desperate to catch up with Marsh, Cope invested his dwindling fortune\ninto silver mining. The gamble failed, \nand he was left nearly destitute. While Cope contemplated selling \nhis precious collection, Marsh was named lead paleontologist \nfor the US Geological Survey. This well-funded branch of the government \noften sponsored Westward expeditions, giving Marsh even more resources\nto vanquish his rival. The Bone Wars spilled into public view \nwhen Cope had a tabloid newspaper publish an article accusing Marsh \nof plagiarism, fraud, and corruption. Marsh fired back and the two further \ntarnished each other’s reputations. Neither ever relented. When Cope died, he donated\nhis skull to science, hoping to prove that his brain was\nlarger than that of his enemy. Marsh never accepted the challenge. Although Marsh named more species \nthan Cope, both men greatly expanded \nour understanding of evolution. But their egotistical one-upmanship\nreminds us that, in spite of its ideals, science is a personal enterprise\nconducted by individual— and at times deeply flawed— \nhuman beings. "

        "text": "A canvas drenched in sunset hues,\ncolors radiating like flame. At first glance, this painting may appear \nto be an impossible, abstract image. But a closer look reveals \nthe tender stems, lush petals and velvety texture \nof a Canna Lily. This metamorphosis of natural subjects\ninto abstract geometry is commonplace in the work \nof Georgia O’Keeffe— the revolutionary American painter \nand sculptor. But the magic behind \nthis transformation remains just as elusive as the artist herself. Born in Wisconsin in 1887, O’Keeffe spent\nher childhood plucking wildflowers and arranging fruits to paint. At seventeen, she moved to Chicago \nto study at the prestigious Art Institute. Her teachers trained her \nto faithfully reproduce reality in the conventions of European masters. Although she enjoyed the solitude \nand precision of this work, O’Keeffe felt little \npersonal connection to it. After moving to New York, she was \nincreasingly drawn to the clean lines, striking composition and vivid colors \nof Japanese art. O’Keeffe soon found a teacher \nwhose lessons inspired her to put those interests into practice. Unlike her previous teachers, Arthur Wesley Dow urged his students\nto focus on more abstract representations of light, shape, and color. These lessons manifested in O’Keeffe’s\nfirst series of abstract drawings. Rendered in charcoal, they present \na series of undulating lines, bold shading and billowing clouds. These drawings defy easy classification— suggesting, but never quite matching,\nany specific natural reference. Earlier European painters \nin the Cubist tradition had employed rigid geometry\nto abstract external subjects. But here, O’Keeffe employed \nthe shapes and rhythms of nature to capture her internal feelings. Experiments like these \nwould soon become a cornerstone of an artistic movement \ncalled American Modernism. Although no single style defines \nModernist painting, its proponents shared a desire \nto challenge the realist traditions that dominated art education. Beginning in the late 1910’s, \nModernist painting often used geometric shapes \nand bold colors to probe the American psyche. O’Keeffe threw herself \ninto these experiments — but she was reluctant \nto share her new work. However, when a friend sent her charcoals\nto the art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, he became entranced. In 1916, he arranged \nfor a grand exhibition in New York. This marked the beginning of O’Keeffe’s\ncareer as a popular artist— and a relationship that would lead \nto marriage in 1924. Marriage didn’t diminish O’Keeffe’s\ntaste for solitude. She travelled widely to teach, and often retreated to paint \nfor months at a time. Whether she was exploring \nthe craggy canyons of Texas, the quiet forests of South Carolina, \nor the sun-bleached desert of New Mexico, her creative process was based on \nritual and close observation. She paid meticulous attention \nto small details, and spent hours mixing paints \nto create exactly the right colors. When she found the perfect hue,\nshe’d record it in her ever-growing collection\nof handmade color cards. O’Keeffe also experimented \nwith perspective to celebrate objects that were often overlooked. In \"Rams Head with Hollyhock,\" she places a weathered skull \nand a delicate flower high above the hills below. This massive skull overshadows \nthe landscape, casting both the skeleton \nand the mountains in a new, eerie light. The public was captivated by her \nunique perspective and secretive behavior. She was particularly praised \nfor her massive flower paintings, ranging from fiery poppies \nto ghostly calla lillies. Stieglitz and other critics of the time \nwere infatuated by Freudian psychology, and were quick to link these paintings\nto female genitalia. But O’Keeffe dismissed \nsuch interpretations. She resented the male gaze \nthat dominated the art world, and demanded her work be respected for its emotional evocation \nof the natural world. Eventually, O’Keeffe settled down \nin New Mexico, near one of her favorite artist retreats. In her 70’s, her eyesight began to fail, but she continued to mine the landscape’s\nmysteries in new, tactile mediums. O’Keeffe kept creating \nuntil her death at 98, and is remembered as \nthe “Mother of American Modernism.” Decades on, her work retains \nits wild energy— and O’Keeffe her personal mystique. "

        "text": "Corn currently accounts for more than \none tenth of our global crop production. The United States alone has enough \ncornfields to cover Germany. But while other crops we grow \ncome in a range of varieties, over 99% of cultivated corn is the \nexact same type: Yellow Dent #2. This means that humans grow \nmore Yellow Dent #2 than any other plant on the planet. So how did this single variety \nof this single plant become the biggest success story \nin agricultural history? Nearly 9,000 years ago, corn, \nalso called maize, was first domesticated from teosinte, \na grass native to Mesoamerica. Teosinte’s rock-hard seeds \nwere barely edible, but its fibrous husk could be turned \ninto a versatile material. Over the next 4,700 years, farmers bred \nthe plant into a staple crop, with larger cobs and edible kernels. As maize spread throughout the Americas, \nit took on an important role, with multiple indigenous societies \nrevering a “Corn Mother” as the goddess who created agriculture. When Europeans first arrived in America, \nthey shunned the strange plant. Many even believed it was the source of \nphysical and cultural differences between them and the Mesoamericans. However, their attempts to cultivate European crops\nin American soil quickly failed, and the settlers were forced \nto expand their diet. Finding the crop to their taste, \nmaize soon crossed the Atlantic, where its ability to grow in diverse \nclimates made it a popular grain in many European countries. But the newly established United States \nwas still the corn capital of the world. In the early 1800’s, different regions \nacross the country produced strains of varying \nsize and taste. In the 1850’s, however, these unique varieties proved difficult \nfor train operators to package, and for traders to sell. Trade boards in rail hubs like Chicago \nencouraged corn farmers to breed one standardized crop. This dream would finally be \nrealized at 1893’s World’s Fair, where James Reid’s yellow dent corn \nwon the Blue Ribbon. Over the next 50 years, yellow dent \ncorn swept the nation. Following the technological \ndevelopments of World War II, mechanized harvesters became \nwidely available. This meant a batch of corn that previously\ntook a full day to harvest by hand could now be collected in just 5 minutes. Another wartime technology, the chemical \nexplosive ammonium nitrate, also found new life on the farm. With this new synthetic fertilizer, farmers could plant dense fields \nof corn year after year, without the need to rotate their crops \nand restore nitrogen to the soil. While these advances made corn an \nattractive crop to American farmers, US agricultural policy limited the \namount farmers could grow to ensure high sale prices. But in 1972, President Richard Nixon \nremoved these limitations while negotiating massive grain \nsales to the Soviet Union. With this new trade deal \nand WWII technology, corn production exploded into \na global phenomenon. These mountains of maize inspired \nnumerous corn concoctions. Cornstarch could be used as a thickening \nagent for everything from gasoline to glue or processed into a low-cost sweetener \nknown as High-Fructose Corn Syrup. Maize quickly became one of the \ncheapest animal feeds worldwide. This allowed for inexpensive \nmeat production, which in turn increased the demand \nfor meat and corn feed. Today, humans eat only 40% of \nall cultivated corn, while the remaining 60% supports consumer \ngood industries worldwide. Yet the spread of this wonder-crop \nhas come at a price. Global water sources are polluted by \nexcess ammonium nitrate from cornfields. Corn accounts for a large portion of \nagriculture-related carbon emissions, partly due to the increased meat \nproduction it enables. The use of high fructose corn syrup may \nbe a contributor to diabetes and obesity. And the rise of monoculture farming has left our food supply dangerously \nvulnerable to pests and pathogens— a single virus could infect the world’s \nsupply of this ubiquitous crop. Corn has gone from a bushy grass to an essential element of the \nworld’s industries. But only time will tell if it has led us \ninto a maze of unsustainability. "

        "text": "On December 12, 1904, \nChief Lontulu laid 110 twigs in front of a foreign commission. Every twig represented a person \nin his village who died because of King Leopold’s horrific regime\nin the Congo— all in the name of rubber. Chief Lontulu separated the twigs \ninto four piles: tribal nobles, men, women, and children— then proceeded\nto name the dead of one-by-one. His testimony joined hundreds of others\nto help bring an end to one of the greatest atrocities \nin history. Beginning in the late 1800s, European countries participated in the\nso-called “Scramble for Africa.” They colonized 90% of the continent, exploiting African resources \nand enriching their countries. Belgium had recently become\nan independent kingdom. Its ruler, Leopold II, \nwanted to acquire what he called “a slice of this magnificent \nAfrican cake.” Meanwhile, he read colonial explorer \nHenry Morton Stanley’s reports about traveling through Africa. Stanley emphasized \nthe Congo basin’s majesty. So, in 1879, Leopold contracted him\nto return to the Congo. There, Stanley deceived leaders \ninto signing some 450 treaties allowing for land use. Leopold persuaded the US and European\npowers to grant him ownership of the Congo, pledging to protect free trade \nin the region. And on May 29, 1885, a territory more than\n80 times the size of Belgium and home to 20 million people was declared\nhis own private colony— by no one it actually belonged to. Leopold lost no time consolidating power \nin what he called the Congo Free State. He claimed land, raised an army, and forced many Congolese men\nto complete unpaid labor. Things got even worse when, in 1887, a Scottish inventor redeveloped\nthe pneumatic tire, creating a massive international\nmarket for rubber. The Congo had one of the world’s\nlargest supplies. Leopold seized the opportunity, requiring villages to meet \never-greater rubber quotas. Congolese men had to harvest\nthe material from wild vines. As supplies drained, they walked for days\nto gather enough. Leopold’s army entered villages and held \nwomen and children hostage until the impossible quota was met. Soldiers sexually violated women \nand deprived children of food and water. Congolese people rebelled— they refused to cooperate, \nfought Leopold’s soldiers, hid in the forests, \nand destroyed rubber vines. Leopold’s army responded to resistance \nor failure to meet quotas with unflinching torture and executions. Because guns and ammunition\nwere expensive, officers ordered soldiers to prove they \nused their bullets in the line of duty by removing a hand from anyone \nthey killed. However, many soldiers hunted \nusing their guns. To avoid harsh penalties and account \nfor lost bullets, they cut off living people’s hands. They also used this practice\nas punishment. If rubber quotas weren’t met, soldiers would sever people’s hands\nand bring them to their commanders instead of rubber. The regime dramatically upended\ndaily life and agriculture, causing widespread starvation and disease. Meanwhile, King Leopold built monuments \nand private estates with the wealth he extracted. Soon, people brought international\nattention to the horrific abuses of Leopold’s Congo Free State. In 1890, American journalist \nGeorge Washington Williams accused King Leopold of “deceit, fraud, \nrobberies, arson, murder, slave-raiding,\nand [a] general policy of cruelty.” In 1903, Diplomat Roger Casement \nwrote a report that corroborated the nature and scale of the atrocities. It was published the following year. In response, Leopold appointed his own \ncommission to investigate the accusations. They heard numerous witness statements \nin the Congo— Chief Lontulu’s included. The report only confirmed the worst. Facing pressure, Leopold relinquished \ncontrol of the Congo to the Belgian government in 1908. But this did not mean justice. The Belgian state awarded Leopold\n50 million francs “in testimony for his great sacrifice \nin favor of the Congo.” He died the following year. Crowds booed his funeral procession. For more than 50 years following,\nthe Congo remained a Belgian colony, until declaring independence in 1960. That year, the Congo elected its first\nprime minister, Patrice Lumumba. But months later, he was unseated \nin a US and Belgium backed coup. In early 1961, Lumumba was assassinated \nunder Belgian supervision. The coup launched the country \ninto a decades-long dictatorship. Around 10 million Congolese people \nare thought to have died during Leopold’s occupation and looting \nof the Congo. Despite this devastation, calls \nfor reparations have gone unanswered. To this day, throughout Belgium can be \nfound the monuments King Leopold built on a foundation of inconceivable cruelty. "

Luckily, it has an option many don’t: as a walking catfish, it can dance \nits way out of the water and onto bigger and better things. However, it faces many challenges \non its terrestrial journey: it’s now in danger of suffocating, \ndrying up, suffering physical damage \nfrom rough terrain, and being hunted by land predators. We think of fish \nas completely aquatic animals. But the walking catfish is just one \nof hundreds of fish species that are actually amphibious, meaning that they possess adaptations \nthat enable them to survive on land. Fish amphibiousness is a spectrum. At one end are species \nlike the mosquitofish that’ll only move on land when forced. And at the other end \nare species like mudskippers that nonchalantly hop around mudflats \nfor days at a time. But why do fish make the exodus \nfrom water to land? And how do they cope \nwith this drastic transition? If temperatures get too high \nfor the mangrove rivulus in the shallow tropical pools \nit inhabits, it’ll flip itself onto a bank \nand cool off in the shade. During the dry period, it can survive for two months \nout of the water by staying in moist environments. Meanwhile, the eel catfish \nmakes its onshore voyage to satisfy its hearty craving for beetles. And for others, the terrestrial draw \nis more ritualistic. Every year under the cover of night, masses of California grunion flop \ntheir way onto sandy beaches, where females deposit thousands of eggs \ninto the sand before re-entering the ocean. Underwater, fish breathe with gills, which are feathery organs \npacked with blood vessels that absorb dissolved oxygen \nfrom the water. But in the open air, their gills collapse \nand are rendered useless, so amphibious fishes need \nother ways to breathe. The armored catfish’s stomach \nis packed with blood vessels, so it can gulp down air \nand breathe through its stomach lining. And lungfish, being related \nto the ancestors of all tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates, \nare equipped with true lungs. They’ll actually drown \nif they’re kept underwater too long. Fish have thin, permeable skin \nthat allows for essential compounds to diffuse into and out of their bodies \nwhile they’re underwater. But this works against them on land \nas their bodily moisture diffuses into the air. To dodge dehydration, mudskippers \nroll in the mud like puppies. But the lungfish takes the cake: the rivers it inhabits disappear \nduring dry seasons, so it buries itself in the earth\nand coats its body in a mucus cocoon. It can survive like this for years \nuntil being resuscitated by the next big rainstorm. Amphibious fishes use powerful fins \nto move on land and clever tools to navigate as they go. The Nopoli rock-climbing goby, \nno bigger than a few centimeters, scales hundred-meter-tall \nHawaiian waterfalls, inching its way up by alternately \nattaching the suction cups on its mouth and pelvic fins. To find water while on land, \nthe mummichog, like most amphibious fishes, \nis on the lookout for reflective surfaces. Other species, like mosquitofish, exercise their inner ear to determine \nwhere they’re oriented on a slope, relying on the probability that they’ll \nfind water by moving downhill. Our walking catfish, meanwhile, uses the taste buds that coat \nits body for navigation. These taste buds are concentrated \nin its whiskers, which whip through the air, sensing compounds that signal \nthe proximity and quality of nearby water— and prey. The walking catfish will shimmy towards \nattractive volatile amino acids while steering clear of foul waters \nemanating hydrogen sulfide. While amphibious fishes face a multitude \nof new challenges upon leaving the water, they’ve evolved ingenious ways \nto overcome them. They’re resilient in the face \nof droughts and floods and have access to new prey \nas well as a plan B if they need to escape competitive, \npolluted, or unhealthy environments. While being a “fish out of water” \nis generally regarded as a bad thing, for these species, \nit offers an undisputed edge. "

        "text": "Before the sun never \nset on the British Empire, before Genghis Khan swept the steppe, before Rome extended its influence\nto encircle the Mediterranean Sea, there was ancient Assyria. Considered by historians \nto be the first true empire, Assyria’s innovations laid the groundwork \nfor every superpower that’s followed. At its height, in the 7th century BCE, the Assyrian Empire stretched \nacross modern Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and parts of Turkey, Iran, and Egypt. Its wonders included a vast library \nand large botanical and zoological park. But the story of Assyria’s rise \nto dominance began many centuries earlier, in the Late Bronze Age, \nin a city called Ashur. Ashur was a tin and textiles \ntrading center located along the Tigris River \nin northern Iraq. It shared its name with a god thought \nto be an embodiment of the city and later of the entire empire. For the administration-minded Assyrians,\npolitics and religion were closely linked. Around 1300 BCE, a high priest named\nAshur-uballit I took the title of king and initiated a tradition \nof military campaigns, effectively transforming Assyria\nfrom a city-state to a territorial state. This meant that a single \nadministrative entity oversaw many places, cultures, \nand peoples. For the next 150 years,\nAssyria extended its reach and thrived. In the 12th century BCE, a mysterious catastrophe \nthat still bewilders archaeologists caused the Assyrians \nto lose much of their territory. A few hundred years later, however, Assyrian kings began \na new round of conquests. This time, they honed \ntheir administrative system into an empire \nthat would last generations. Assyrians were military innovators \nand merciless conquerors. During their conquests, they used siege tactics and cruel \npunishments for those who opposed them, including impalement and flaying. The growth of their empire \nwas due, in part, to their strategy \nof deporting local populations, then shifting them around the\nempire to fulfill different needs. This broke peoples’ bonds \nwith their homelands and severed loyalties among local groups. Once the Assyrians conquered an area, they built cities connected \nby well-maintained royal roads. Often, when a new king came to power,\nhe would build a new capital. With each move, new palaces and temples \nwere erected and lavishly decorated. Although kings claimed absolute power, we know that an extensive system \nof courtiers, provincial officials, and scholars influenced affairs. At least one woman, Sammuramat, \nruled the kingdom. Assyrian rulers celebrated \ntheir military excursions by having representations \nof their exploits carved into the walls \nof their newly built palaces. But despite the picture of a ruthless \nwar state projected by these records, the Assyrian kings were also interested \nin the cultural traditions of the region, especially those of Babylonia, \na separate state to the south. Babylonia had been \na cultural leader for millennia, stretching back \nto the beginning of writing at the end of the 4th millennium BCE. Assyria saw itself as the inheritor \nand protector of this tradition. Assyrian rulers supported scholars in specialties ranging \nfrom medicine to magic, and the capital cities, like Ninevah, were home to elaborate parks and gardens that housed plants \nand animals from around the empire. One of Assyria’s final rulers, \nAshurbanipal, sent scholars throughout Babylonia to\ngather up and copy ancient literary works. Ashurbanipal’s library took the form \nof clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform in the languages \nof Akkadian and Sumerian. The library was lost during the final sack\nof Ninevah in 612 BCE. But thanks to a 19th century \narchaeological excavation, many masterpieces of ancient literature, including the Epic of Gilgamesh \nand the Babylonian Creation Epic, survive today. After centuries of rule, the Assyrian Empire fell to \nthe Babylonians and Medes between 612 and 609 BCE. Yet the innovations that the Assyrians \npioneered live on. Their emphasis on constant innovation, efficient administration, and excellent infrastructure set the standard for every empire\nthat’s followed them in the region and across the globe. "

Within the 584 day cycle, Venus is visible\nin the evening sky for 250 days, then disappears for 8 days before \nreappearing as the Morning Star. The ancient Maya ascribed particular \nsignificance to this point in this cycle: the first time Venus appears before \nsunrise after being invisible. On this day, Chak Ek’ rose again from the \nunderworld, wielding a spearthrower and darts. To bring discord to the world, he decided to attack his brother \nand his brother’s allies. His first target was K’awiil, god of \nsustenance and lightning. Rising in the late rainy season, Chak Ek’ \naimed his spear and struck K’awiil, causing damage to the food and a \nperiod of chaos in the social order until K’awiil was reborn. 584 days after attacking K’awiil, Chak Ek’ turned his attention back to his \nbrother, the Sun. Each night, the Sun took the form of \njaguar and journeyed through the underworld. Chak Ek’ speared the jaguar sun as it rose\nat dawn towards the end of the dry season. The Sun was wounded, plunging the \nworld into a period of chaos and warfare. Chak Ek’s third victim \nwas the god of maize, who provided sustenance for all humankind. Chak Ek’ speared him at the \ntime of the harvest. He was buried in the underworld, \nand maize—the staple of life— was no longer available \nto Earth’s inhabitants. But the maize god emerged after three \nmonths in the place of new beginnings– the eastern cave known as Seven Water \nPlace– bringing food once again to earth. When the turtle Ak Na'ak rose in the sky \nto mark the summer solstice, Chak Ek’ claimed his fourth victim. With the death of this good omen, \nthe Sun, the food supply, and the people were buried within the earth, and the \nforces of chaos reigned. But out of the chaos rose a new order\nestablished by Hun Ajaw, one of the hero twins known to all for having vanquished \nthe lords of the underworld. A new race of humans was created, \nmade from maize. This state of balance was not to last, \nhowever. Chak Ek’s fifth and final victim was a \nmysterious stranger from the west, and his death \nin the heart of the dry season shook the order established by Hun Ajaw. The gods, the lords, and the maize were \nburied in the underworld. But this victory for Chak Ek’ would also \nprove temporary. The two brothers, Venus and the Sun, \nwere caught in an endless cycle as they battled for supremacy, re-enacting\nthe same five struggles, while the world alternated between order\nand chaos with the rising of the Morning Star.

        "text": "Between you and the rest of the world \nlies an interface that makes up 16% of your physical weight. This is your skin, the largest organ \nin your body: laid out flat, it would cover close to \n1.7 square meters of ground. Its purpose may seem obvious—\nto keep our insides in. But a look beyond the surface reveals that it plays a surprising \nnumber of roles in our lives. First, the basics. Skin is the foundation \nof the integumentary system, which also incorporates your hair, \nnails, and specialized glands and nerves. Made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, skin’s thickness varies \nfrom 0.5 millimeters at its thinnest and up to four millimeters \nat its thickest. It also carries out three key functions: protecting, regulating, and sensing the world beyond its limits. On a daily basis, its huge surface \nprocesses hundreds, if not thousands, of physical sensations, relying mostly on large, \npressure-sensitive skin components called Merkel cells. In your fingertips alone, there are 750 Merkel cells \nper each square-centimeter of skin, coupled with over 2,500 receptors\nthat give you your sense of touch. This surface is also the body’s first \nmajor line of defense. Without it, you’d be a soggy mass \nof tissue and fluids, fatally exposed to the elements. Skin effectively seals off your insides and also absorbs pressure and shock with flexible collagen \nthat makes up most of its dermal layer. The epidermis is made up mainly \nof skin cells called keratinocytes that are completely replaced \nevery four weeks. As new cells form at the base of the\nepidermis, older ones are pushed up. When these cells move upwards, they’re filled with a hardened protein \ncalled keratin. Once they reach the surface, they form a tightly-overlapping, \nwaterproof layer that’s difficult for invading \nmicrobes to breach. Any harmful microbes that make it \ninto the epidermis will encounter Langerhans cells. This group of protective skin cells \ndetects invaders and communicates their presence \nto resident immune system T-cells, which react by launching \nan immune response. A crucial feature of this immune defense is the several thousand \nspecies of microorganisms that inhabit the planes, folds, and crevices of your skin. These microbes, \nwhich include bacteria and fungi, thrive in the sebum, an oily substance that’s secreted \nonto the skin’s surface by sebaceous glands nestled\ninside the dermis. These skin microbes keep the immune system\nin a state of constant surveillance, ensuring that it’s ready to react \nif the body really is at risk. Beyond this protective role, your skin is also a sensory organ that\nhelps regulate your body’s temperature, two roles that are closely interlinked. Nerves detect whether your skin \nis warm or cold and communicate that\ninformation to your brain. In return, the brain instructs\nlocalized blood vessels to either expand if the body is too warm, releasing heat from \nthe blood through the skin, or to constrict if the body is cold,\nwhich retains heat. At any given time, up to 25% of the body's\nblood is circulating through the dermis, making this process extremely efficient. Under warm conditions, the skin’s sweat glands will secrete sweat\nvia ducts onto the surface, transferring heat out of the body. Hair can also be stimulated\nto conserve or release body warmth. The average human \nhas 5 million hair follicles embedded everywhere on the body except the palms of your hands \nand soles of your feet. Ninety to 150,000 of those \nare on your scalp, where they help shield\nthe large surface area of your head from physical damage and sunburn. When you're cold, tiny muscles \ncalled arrector pilli cause hair to stand upright\nacross the body. That’s the phenomenon known as goosebumps\nand it traps body heat close to your skin. Skin’s vast surface isn’t just a shield; it also enables us to interact \nand connect with the world. Its multifunctional layer cools us down\nand keeps us warm. The integumentary system \nmay be many things, but it’s certainly more than skin deep. "

        "text": "Reaching heights of over 100 meters, Californian sequoias tower over Earth’s \nother estimated 60,000 tree species. Growing in the misty Sierra Nevada \nmountains, their massive trunks support the \ntallest known trees in the world. But even these behemoths seem \nto have their limits. No sequoia on record has been able \nto grow taller than 130 meters – and many researchers say these \ntrees won’t beat that cap even if they live for thousands of \nyears to come. So what exactly is stopping these trees \nfrom growing taller, forever? It all comes down to sap. In order for trees to grow, they need to bring sugars obtained \nfrom photosynthesis and nutrients brought in through the root \nsystem to wherever growth is happening. And just like blood circulates in \nthe human body, trees are designed to circulate two kinds \nof sap throughout their bodies – carrying all the substances a \ntree’s cells need to live. The first is phloem sap. Containing the sugars generated in \nleaves during photosynthesis, phloem sap is thick, like honey, and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue \nto distribute sugar throughout the tree. By the end of its journey, the phloem sap has thinned \ninto a watery substance, pooling at the base of the tree. Right beside the phloem is the tree’s \nother tissue type: the xylem. This tissue is packed with nutrients and \nions like calcium, potassium, and iron, which the tree has absorbed \nthrough its roots. Here at the tree’s base, there are more of these particles in \none tissue than the other, so the water from the phloem sap is \nabsorbed into the xylem to correct the balance. This process, called osmotic movement, creates nutrient-rich xylem sap, which will then travel up the trunk to \nspread those nutrients through the tree. But this journey faces a formidable \nobstacle: gravity. To accomplish this herculean task, \nthe xylem relies on three forces: transpiration, capillary action, \nand root pressure. As part of photosynthesis, leaves open \nand close pores called stomata. These openings allow oxygen and carbon \ndioxide in and out of the leaf, but they also create an opening through \nwhich water evaporates. This evaporation, called transpiration, creates negative pressure in the xylem, \npulling watery xylem sap up the tree. This pull is aided by a fundamental \nproperty of water called capillary action. In narrow tubes, the attraction between water molecules and the adhesive forces between the water \nand its environment can beat out gravity. This capillary motion is in full effect \nin xylem filaments thinner than human hair. And where these two forces pull the sap, the osmotic movement at the tree’s \nbase creates root pressure, pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk. Together these forces launch sap \nto dizzying heights, distributing nutrients, and growing new \nleaves to photosynthesize – far above the tree’s roots. But despite these sophisticated systems, every centimeter is a fight \nagainst gravity. As trees grow taller and taller, the supply of these vital fluids \nbegins to dwindle. At a certain height, trees can no longer afford the lost water \nthat evaporates during photosynthesis. And without the photosynthesis needed \nto support additional growth, the tree instead turns its resources \ntowards existing branches. This model, known as the “hydraulic \nlimitation hypothesis,” is currently our best explanation for why \ntrees have limited heights, even in perfect growing conditions. And using this model alongside \ngrowth rates and known needs for nutrients \nand photosynthesis, researchers have been able to propose \nheight limits for specific species. So far these limits have held up – even the world’s tallest tree still falls \nabout fifteen meters below the cap. Researchers are still investigating the \npossible explanations for this limit, and there may not be one universal \nreason why trees stop growing. But until we learn more, the height of trees is yet another\nway that gravity, literally, shapes life on Earth. "

        "text": "Language is endlessly variable. Each of us can come up with \nan infinite number of sentences in our native language, and we’re able to do so from an early age— almost as soon as we start \nto communicate in sentences. How is this possible? In the early 1950s, Noam Chomsky \nproposed a theory based on the observation that the key \nto this versatility seems to be grammar: the familiar grammatical structure \nof an unfamiliar sentence points us toward its meaning. He suggested that there are \ngrammatical rules that apply to all languages,\nand that the rules are innate— the human brain is hardwired to process\nlanguage according to these rules. He labelled this faculty \nuniversal grammar, and it launched lines of inquiry \nthat shaped both the field of linguistics and the emerging field \nof cognitive science for decades to come. Chomsky and other researchers \nset out to investigate the two main components \nof universal grammar: first, whether there are, in fact, \ngrammar rules that are universal to all languages, and, second, whether these rules \nare hardwired in the brain. In attempts to establish \nthe universal rules of grammar, Chomsky developed an analytical tool\nknown as generative syntax, which represents the order of words \nin a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees that show what structures are possible. Based on this tree, we could suggest \na grammar rule that adverbs must occur in verb phrases. But with more data, \nit quickly becomes clear that adverbs can appear \noutside of verb phrases. This simplified example illustrates \na major problem: it takes a lot of data \nfrom each individual language to establish the rules for that language, before we can even begin to determine which rules all languages \nmight have in common. When Chomsky proposed universal grammar, many languages lacked the volume \nof recorded samples necessary to analyze them \nusing generative syntax. Even with lots of data, mapping the structure of a language\nis incredibly complex. After 50 years of analysis, we still\nhaven’t completely figured out English. As more linguist data \nwas gathered and analyzed, it became clear that languages \naround the world differ widely, challenging the theory that there were \nuniversal grammar rules. In the 1980s, Chomsky revised his theory in an attempt to accommodate \nthis variation. According to his new hypothesis \nof principles and parameters, all languages shared certain \ngrammatical principles, but could vary in their parameters, \nor the application of these principles. For example, a principle is \n“every sentence must have a subject,\" but the parameter of whether the subject\nmust be explicitly stated could vary between languages. The hypothesis of principles \nand parameters still didn’t answer the question of which\ngrammatical principles are universal. In the early 2000s, Chomsky suggested \nthat there’s just one shared principle, called recursion, which means structures\ncan be nested inside each other. Take this sentence, which embeds a sentence within a sentence \nwithin a sentence. Or this sentence, which embeds \na noun phrase in a noun phrase in a noun phrase. Recursion was a good candidate \nfor a universal grammar rule because it can take many forms. However, in 2005 linguists \npublished findings on an Amazonian language called Piraha, which doesn’t appear to have \nany recursive structures. So what about the other part \nof Chomsky’s theory, that our language faculty is innate? When he first proposed universal grammar, the idea that there was a genetically \ndetermined aspect of language acquisition had a profound, revolutionary impact. It challenged the dominant paradigm, \ncalled behaviorism. Behaviorists argued that all animal \nand human behaviors, including language, were acquired from the outside \nby the mind, which starts out as a blank slate. Today, scientists agree that behaviorism \nwas wrong, and there is underlying, \ngenetically encoded biological machinery for language learning. Many think the same biology \nresponsible for language is also responsible for other \naspects of cognition. So they disagree with Chomsky’s idea that there is a specific, isolated,\ninnate language faculty in the brain. The theory of universal grammar\nprompted the documentation and study of many languages \nthat hadn’t been studied before. It also caused an old idea to be \nreevaluated and eventually overthrown to make room for our growing \nunderstanding of the human brain. "

        "text": "A 13,000 mile dragon of earth and stone winds its way through\nthe countryside of China with a history almost as long\nand serpentine as the structure. The Great Wall began as multiple walls\nof rammed earth built by individual feudal states\nduring the Chunqiu period to protect against nomadic raiders\nnorth of China and each other. When Emperor Qin Shi Huang\nunified the states in 221 BCE, the Tibetan Plateau and Pacific Ocean\nbecame natural barriers, but the mountains in the north\nremained vulnerable to Mongol, Turkish, and Xiongnu invasions. To defend against them, the Emperor expanded the small walls\nbuilt by his predecessors, connecting some and fortifying others. As the structures grew\nfrom Lintao in the west to Liaodong in the east, they collectively became known\nas The Long Wall. To accomplish this task, the Emperor enlisted soldiers\nand commoners, not always voluntarily. Of the hundreds of thousands of builders\nrecorded during the Qin Dynasty, many were forcibly conscripted peasants and others were criminals\nserving out sentences. Under the Han Dynasty,\nthe wall grew longer still, reaching 3700 miles, and spanning from Dunhuang\nto the Bohai Sea. Forced labor continued\nunder the Han Emperor Han-Wudi , and the walls reputation grew\ninto a notorious place of suffering. Poems and legends of the time\ntold of laborers buried in nearby mass graves, or even within the wall itself. And while no human remains\nhave been found inside, grave pits do indicate\nthat many workers died from accidents, hunger and exhaustion. The wall was formidable\nbut not invincible. Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan\nmanaged to surmount the wall during the Mongol invasion\nof the 13th Century. After the Ming dynasty\ngained control in 1368, they began to refortify\nand further consolidate the wall using bricks and stones from local kilns. Averaging 23 feet high and 21 feet wide, the walls 5500 miles\nwere punctuated by watchtowers. When raiders were sighted, fire and smoke signals traveled\nbetween towers until reinforcements arrived. Small openings along the wall\nlet archers fire on invaders, while larger ones were used\nto drop stones and more. But even this new and improved wall\nwas not enough. In 1644, northern Manchu clans\noverthrew the Ming to establish the Qing dynasty, incorporating Mongolia as well, Thus, for the second time, China was ruled by the very people\nthe wall had tried to keep out. With the empire's borders\nnow extending beyond the Great Wall, the fortifications lost their purpose. And without regular reinforcement,\nthe wall fell into disrepair, rammed earth eroded, while brick and stone were plundered\nfor building materials. But its job wasn't finished. During World War II, China used sections for defense\nagainst Japanese invasion, and some parts are still rumored\nto be used for military training. But the Wall's main purpose\ntoday is cultural. As one of the largest man-made\nstructures on Earth, it was granted UNESCO\nWorld Heritage Status in 1987. Originally built to keep\npeople out of China, the Great Wall now welcomes\nmillions of visitors each year. In fact, the influx of tourists\nhas caused the wall to deteriorate, leading the Chinese government\nto launch preservation initiatives. It's also often acclaimed as the only\nman-made structure visible from space. Unfortunately, that's not at all true. In low Earth orbit,\nall sorts of structures, like bridges, highways\nand airports are visible, and the Great Wall\nis only barely discernible. From the moon, it doesn't stand a chance. But regardless, it's the Earth\nwe should be studying it from because new sections\nare still discovered every few years, branching off from the main body and expanding this remarkable\nmonument to human achievement.

These oily films are hundreds of times\nthinner than a strand of spider silk, yet strong enough to protect\nthe delicate contents of life: the cell's watery cytoplasm, \ngenetic material, organelles, and all the molecules it needs to survive. How does the membrane work,\nand where does that strength come from? First of all, it's tempting to think of a\ncell membrane like the tight skin of a balloon, but it's actually something \nmuch more complex. In reality, it's constantly in flux, shifting components back and forth\nto help the cell take in food, remove waste, let specific molecules in and out, communicate with other cells, gather information about the environment, and repair itself. The cell membrane gets this resilience,\nflexibility, and functionality by combining a variety \nof floating components in what biologists call a fluid mosaic. The primary component of the fluid mosaic is a simple molecule \ncalled a phospholipid. A phospholipid has a polar, \nelectrically-charged head, which attracts water, and a non-polar tail, which repels it. They pair up tail-to-tail\nin a two layer sheet just five to ten nanometers thick\nthat extends all around the cell. The heads point in towards the cytoplasm and out towards the watery fluid \nexternal to the cell with the lipid tails \nsandwiched in between. This bilayer, which at body temperature\nhas the consistency of vegetable oil, is studded with other types of molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and cholesterol. Cholesterol keeps the membrane \nat the right fluidity. It also helps regulate communication\nbetween cells. Sometimes, cells talk to each other by releasing and capturing \nchemicals and proteins. The release of proteins is easy, but the capture of them \nis more complicated. That happens through a process called\nendocytosis in which sections of the membrane\nengulf substances and transport them into the cell\nas vesicles. Once the contents have been released, the vesicles are recycled and returned\nto the cell membrane. The most complex components\nof the fluid mosaic are proteins. One of their key jobs is to make sure that the right molecules \nget in and out of the cell. Non-polar molecules, like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and certain vitamins can cross the phospholipid \nbilayer easily. But polar and charged molecules can't\nmake it through the fatty inner layer. Transmembrane proteins stretch\nacross the bilayer to create channels that allow specific molecules through,\nlike sodium and potassium ions. Peripheral proteins floating\nin the inner face of the bilayer help anchor the membrane to the cell's\ninterior scaffolding. Other proteins in cell membranes\ncan help fuse two different bilayers. That can work to our benefit,\nlike when a sperm fertilizes an egg, but also harm us,\nas it does when a virus enters a cell. And some proteins move within\nthe fluid mosaic, coming together to form complexes\nthat carry out specific jobs. For instance, one complex might\nactivate cells in our immune system, then move apart when the job is done. Cell membranes are also the site\nof an ongoing war between us and all the things\nthat want to infect us. In fact, some of the most toxic\nsubstances we know of are membrane-breaching proteins\nmade by infectious bacteria. These pore-forming toxins poke\ngiant holes in our cell membranes, causing a cell's contents to leak out. Scientists are working on developing\nways to defend against them, like using a nano-sponge \nthat saves our cells by soaking up \nthe membrane-damaging toxins. The fluid mosaic is what makes \nall the functions of life possible. Without a cell membrane,\nthere could be no cells, and without cells,\nthere would be no bacteria, no parasites, no fungi, no animals, and no us. "

        "text": "As dawn breaks in the Babylonian city \nof Sippar, Beltani receives an urgent visit\nfrom her brother. It’s 1762 B.C.E., \nduring the reign of King Hammurabi. Beltani is a naditu —\na priestess and businesswoman, promised to the temple at birth. At puberty, she changed her name and gained her elevated naditu status \nin a ceremony where a priest examined the entrails \nof a sacrificed animal for omens. The naditu are an esteemed group drawn\nfrom Babylonia’s most affluent families. Though the rules are different for naditu\nin each city, in Sippar they are celibate\nand never marry. They live inside the gagum, \na walled area inside the temple complex, but are free to come and go,\nand receive visitors. Beltani owns barley fields and a tavern. Her brother manages these businesses while she fulfils her duties\nas a priestess. This morning, he makes \na troubling accusation: her tavern keeper has been diluting\nwine with water. If true, this means she’s been undermining\nthe business Beltani relies on to sustain her in old age. But the consequences would be even higher\nfor the tavern keeper: the punishment of diluting wine\nis death by drowning. The temple court is meeting\nthis afternoon. Beltani has just a few short hours to find out whether there’s any truth \nto these allegations. But she can’t go to the tavern\nto investigate. Taverns are off limits for priestesses,\neven priestesses who own them. She could be burned to death for entering. So she sends for the tavern keeper \nto meet her at the temple of Shamash, the patron god of Sippar. The temple is a stepped pyramid \ncalled a ziggurat, in the heart of the city \nand visible from twenty miles away. It symbolically connects heaven and earth and is viewed as the literal home\nof the god Shamash, who gave humanity the code of laws and is the judge \nof the Babylonian pantheon. Beltani leaves an offering of bread \nand sesame oil in a private room. She never enters the inner chamber \nof the temple where the god lives, a place so holy only high priestesses\nand kings visit. Outside, worshippers play music \nand leave gifts, which are later collected and used to feed\ntemple workers, including the naditu. The tavern keeper is waiting\nwith grim news. She says Beltani’s brother has been\naltering the weights used to measure payments\nto cheat customers. When the tavern keeper confronted him, he falsely accused her\nof watering down the wine. If true, Beltani’s brother \nis the dishonest one — and altering weights is another crime \npunishable by death. Beltani is running out of time\nto get to the bottom of this. Though she can’t go to the tavern, she can check on the barley fields \nher brother manages to see if he’s been honest there. In the granary, she sees much more grain \nthan he reported to her. He’s been cheating her out of her share. Like all naditu in Sippar, Beltani inherited the same portion \nof her father’s property as her brother. These were rare circumstances\nfor women in a time and place where property passed through men. Still, their families didn’t always honor\ntheir rights. Although naditu traditionally\nwent into business with male relatives, the law stated they can choose\nsomeone else if their brothers or uncles\nweren’t up to the task. With the evidence she needs, \nshe hurries to court. A judge presides over the temple court\nalong with two naditu — the overseer of the gagum and a scribe. Beltani asks to remove her brother \nas her business manager, citing the granary as evidence \nthat he is mismanaging her properties. The judge grants her request. The scribe records the new contract \nin cuneiform into a wet clay tablet, and the matter is settled. She's protected her income \nand spared her brother’s life by withholding the true extent \nof his crimes. Perhaps it is time to adopt\na younger priestess: someone to take care of her in old age\nand inherit her property, who might do a better job of helping\nwith her business. "

        "text": "His reign marked the beginning \nof one of history’s greatest empires and the end of one of its first republics. Was Rome’s first emperor a visionary leader who guaranteed \nhis civilization’s place in history or a tyrant who destroyed its core values? Find out in History versus Augustus. Order, order. The defendant today is Gaius Octavius? Gaius Julius Caesar/Augustus... Do we have the wrong guy? No, your Honor. Gaius Octavius, born in 63 BCE, \nwas the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar. He became Gaius Julius Caesar upon being named his great-uncle’s \nadoptive son and heir. And he gained the title Augustus in 27 BCE when the Senate granted \nhim additional honors. You mean when he established \nsole authority and became emperor of Rome. Is that bad? Didn’t every place have some king \nor emperor back then? Actually, your Honor, the Roman people had overthrown \ntheir kings centuries before to establish a republic, a government meant to serve the people,\nnot the privilege of a ruling family. And it was Octavius \nwho destroyed this tradition. Octavius was a model public servant. At 16, he was elected \nto the College of Pontiffs that supervised religious worship. He fought for Rome in Hispania \nalongside his great-uncle Caesar and took up the responsibility \nof avenging Caesar’s death when the corrupt oligarchs in the Senate\nbetrayed and murdered him. Caesar had been a power-hungry tyrant \nwho tried to make himself a king while consorting with \nhis Egyptian queen Cleopatra. After his death, Octavius joined his general Mark Antony in starting a civil war \nthat tore Rome apart, then stabbed his ally in the back \nto increase his own power. Antony was a fool. He waged a disastrous campaign in Parthia and plotted to turn Roman territories into personal kingdoms \nfor himself and Cleopatra. Isn’t that what Caesar \nhad been accused of? Well... So Octavius destroyed Antony \nfor trying to become a king and then became one himself? That’s right. You can see the megalomania even in \nhis adopted title – \"The Illustrious One.\" That was a religious honorific. And Augustus didn’t seek power \nfor his own sake. As winner of the civil war \nand commander of the most troops, it was his duty to restore \nlaw and order to Rome so that other factions \ndidn’t continue fighting. He didn’t restore the law -\nhe made it subordinate to him! Not true. Augustus worked to restore \nthe Senate’s prestige, improved food security \nfor the lower classes, and relinquished control of \nthe army when he resigned his consul post. Mere optics. He used his military influence \nand personal wealth to stack the Senate in his favor, while retaining the powers of a tribune and the right to celebrate \nmilitary triumphs. He kept control of provinces \nwith the most legions. And if that wasn’t enough, he assumed the consul position \ntwice more to promote his grandchildren. He was clearly trying \nto establish a dynasty. But what did he do with all that power? Glad you asked, your Honor. Augustus’s accomplishments \nwere almost too many to name. He established consistent \ntaxation for all provinces, ending private exploitation \nby local tax officials. He personally financed a network of roads\nand employed couriers so news and troops could travel\neasily throughout the realm. And it was under Augustus that many of Rome’s famous \npublic buildings were constructed. The writers of the time were nearly \nunanimous in praising his rule. Did the writers have any other choice? Augustus exiled plenty of people \non vague charges, including Ovid, \none of Rome’s greatest poets. And you forgot to mention the intrusive \nlaws regarding citizens’ personal lives – punishing adultery, restricting marriage \nbetween social classes, even penalties for remaining unmarried. He was trying to improve the citizenry\nand instill discipline. And he succeeded. His legacy speaks for itself: 40 years of internal stability, a professional army that expanded \nRome’s frontiers in all directions, and a government still remembered \nas a model of civic virtue. His legacy was an empire that would go on to wage endless \nconquest until it collapsed, and a tradition of military autocracy. Any time a dictator in a general’s uniform\ncommits atrocities while claiming to act on behalf \nof \"the people,\" we have Augustus Caesar to thank. So you’re saying Augustus \nwas a good emperor, and you’re saying there’s no such thing? We’re used to celebrating \nhistorical leaders for their achievements and victories. But to ask whether an individual should \nhave such power in the first place is to put history itself on trial. "

        "text": "What do Euclid, twelve-year-old Einstein, and American President James Garfield\nhave in common? They all came up with elegant\nproofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem, the rule that says for a right triangle, the square of one side plus\nthe square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In other words, a²+b²=c². This statement is one of the most\nfundamental rules of geometry, and the basis for practical applications, like constructing stable buildings\nand triangulating GPS coordinates. The theorem is named for Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher and mathematician\nin the 6th century B.C., but it was known more than a\nthousand years earlier. A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C.\nlists 15 sets of numbers that satisfy the theorem. Some historians speculate \nthat Ancient Egyptian surveyors used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5,\nto make square corners. The theory is that surveyors could stretch\na knotted rope with twelve equal segments to form a triangle with sides of length\n3, 4 and 5. According to the converse\nof the Pythagorean theorem, that has to make a right triangle, and, therefore, a square corner. And the earliest known \nIndian mathematical texts written between 800 and 600 B.C. state that a rope stretched across\nthe diagonal of a square produces a square twice as large\nas the original one. That relationship can be derived\nfrom the Pythagorean theorem. But how do we know \nthat the theorem is true for every right triangle \non a flat surface, not just the ones these mathematicians\nand surveyors knew about? Because we can prove it. Proofs use existing mathematical rules\nand logic to demonstrate that a theorem\nmust hold true all the time. One classic proof often attributed\nto Pythagoras himself uses a strategy called \nproof by rearrangement. Take four identical right triangles\nwith side lengths a and b and hypotenuse length c. Arrange them so that their hypotenuses\nform a tilted square. The area of that square is c². Now rearrange the triangles\ninto two rectangles, leaving smaller squares on either side. The areas of those squares\nare a² and b². Here's the key. The total area of \nthe figure didn't change, and the areas of the triangles\ndidn't change. So the empty space in one, c² must be equal to \nthe empty space in the other, a² + b². Another proof comes from a fellow Greek\nmathematician Euclid and was also stumbled upon\nalmost 2,000 years later by twelve-year-old Einstein. This proof divides one right triangle\ninto two others and uses the principle that if the\ncorresponding angles of two triangles are the same, the ratio of their sides\nis the same, too. So for these three similar triangles, you can write these expressions\nfor their sides. Next, rearrange the terms. And finally, add the two equations\ntogether and simplify to get ab²+ac²=bc², or a²+b²=c². Here's one that uses tessellation, a repeating geometric pattern\nfor a more visual proof. Can you see how it works? Pause the video if you'd like some time\nto think about it. Here's the answer. The dark gray square is a² and the light gray one is b². The one outlined in blue is c². Each blue outlined square\ncontains the pieces of exactly one dark and one light gray square, proving the Pythagorean theorem again. And if you'd really like \nto convince yourself, you could build a turntable\nwith three square boxes of equal depth connected to each other \naround a right triangle. If you fill the largest square with water\nand spin the turntable, the water from the large square\nwill perfectly fill the two smaller ones. The Pythagorean theorem has more\nthan 350 proofs, and counting, ranging from brilliant to obscure. Can you add your own to the mix? "

        "text": "You’re sitting on the couch watching TV,\nwhen you hear a knock on the door. The police have just arrived \nto arrest your spouse— for murder. This accusation comes as a total shock. In your experience, your partner has\nalways been gentle and loving, and you can't imagine them committing\na grisly murder. But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found\non the murder weapon. Your spouse insists they're innocent. “I know it looks bad,” they say,\n“but you have to believe me! If you don’t, who will?” Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence \nagainst them looks damning? Take a second to think what you would\nbelieve in this situation. This dilemma is part of what philosophers\ncall the ethics of belief: a field of study that explores \nhow we ought to form beliefs, and whether we have ethical duties\nto believe certain things. The question here isn't about\nwhat you should do, such as whether or not you should find\nyour spouse guilty in a court of law. After all, you wouldn’t be on the jury\nin their trial! Rather, it’s about what you should believe\nto be true. So, what factors should you consider? Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence. After all, to believe something\nis to take it to be true. And evidence is, by definition, all information that helps\nus determine what's true. From this, some philosophers draw\nthe conclusion that evidence is the only thing that ought \nto determine what you believe. This view is called evidentialism,\nand a strict evidentialist would say it doesn’t matter that the accused \nis your spouse. You should evaluate the evidence \nfrom a neutral, objective point of view. Taking the perspective \nof an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character\nis a relevant consideration. But finding their fingerprints \nat the crime scene is surely stronger evidence. So, from an evidentialist point of view, you should either believe \nyour spouse is guilty, or at best remain undecided. Some philosophers present\nevidentialism only as a view of what’s most rational to believe. But others, like 19th century \nevidentialist W.K. Clifford, think that following the evidence\nis also morally required. One argument for this view is that \nhaving well-informed, accurate beliefs is often vitally important to determining \nthe ethical way to act. Another argument is that there’s something\nunethical about being dishonest, and refusing to follow the evidence is \na way of being dishonest with oneself. However, perhaps there are other\nethical factors in play. Although the evidence against\nyour spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that\nthey’re actually innocent. Think for a moment about how \nit would feel to be innocent, and have no one believe you—\nnot even your own partner! By not trusting your spouse, you run the risk of seriously hurting\nthem in their crucial hour of need. Moreover, consider what this lack \nof trust would do to your marriage. It would be incredibly difficult \nto continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed—\nor even strongly suspected— was a murderer. You might try to pretend to believe\nthat your spouse is innocent, but could you really \ngo on living that lie? According to a theory of the ethics \nof belief called pragmatism, these kinds of practical considerations\ncan sometimes make it right to believe something\neven without strong evidence. Some pragmatists would even say \nthat you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them. But is it even possible to believe\nyour spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good\nfor your relationship? Or because you think you owe\nit to the accused? You might desperately want \nto believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the\nsame way you control your actions? It seems like you can’t just believe\nwhatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face. But on the other hand, \nrecall your spouse’s plea. When we say things like this, we seem to be assuming that it is possible\nto control our beliefs in some way. So what do you think? \nCan you control what beliefs you have? And if so, what will you believe\nabout your spouse? "

        "text": "More than a century after first emerging into the fog-bound,\ngas-lit streets of Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes \nis universally recognizable. Even his wardrobe and accessories\nare iconic: the Inverness cape, deerstalker hat, and calabash pipe, and figures such as his best friend\nand housemate Doctor Watson, arch-nemesis Moriarty, and housekeeper Mrs. Hudson have become part of the popular\nconsciousness, as have his extraordinary,\ninfallible powers of deduction utilized in the name of the law, his notorious drug use, and his popular catchphrase,\n\"Elementary, my dear Watson.\" And yet many of these most recognizable\nfeatures of Holmes don't appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's\noriginal stories. Doyle's great detective solves\ncrimes in all sorts of ways, not just using deduction. He speculates, and at times even guesses,\nand regularly makes false assumptions. Furthermore, Mrs. Hudson \nis barely mentioned, no one says, \"Elementary, my dear Watson,\" and the detective and his sidekick\nlive apart for much of the time. Moriarty, the grand villain, \nonly appears in two stories, the detective's drug use is infrequent\nafter the first two novels, and Holmes is rarely enthralled\nto the English legal system; He much prefers enacting his own form\nof natural justice to sticking to the letter of the law. Finally, many of the most iconic elements\nof the Holmesian legend aren't Doyle's either. The deerstalker cap and cape\nwere first imagined by Sidney Paget, the story's initial illustrator. the curved pipe was chosen by\nAmerican actor William Gillette so that audiences could more clearly see\nhis face on stage, and the phrase, \n\"Elementary, my dear Watson,\" was coined by author and humorist\nP.G. Wodehouse. So who exactly is Sherlock Holmes? Who's the real great detective,\nand where do we find him? Purists might answer \nthat the original Sherlock inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's \nuniversity mentor Dr. Joseph Bell is the real one. But the fact remains that that version\nof Sherlock has been largely eclipsed by the sheer volume of interpretation, leaving Doyle's detective \nlargely unrecognizable. So there's another, more complex, but perhaps more satisfying\nanswer to the question, but to get there, we must first consider\nthe vast body of interpretations of the great detective. Since Conan Doyle's first story in 1887, there have been thousands \nof adaptations of Holmes, making him perhaps the most adapted\nfictional character in the world. That process began with Victorian\nstage adaptations, and accelerated \nwith the emergence of film. There were more than 100 film adaptations\nof Holmes in the first two decades \nof the 20th century alone. And since then, there have many thousands\nmore in print, and on film, television, stage, and radio. Holmes has been reinterpreted\nby people everywhere, in remarkably different,\nand often contradictory ways. These adaptations demonstrate\nboth Holmes's popularity and his malleability. For instance, he featured in a number\nof allied anti-Nazi propaganda films during World War II. And both Winston Churchill\nand Franklin Delano Roosevelt were avid enthusiasts, the latter even joining \nthe Baker Street Irregulars, a Holmesian appreciation society, and nicknaming one secret service\nhideout Baker Street. And yet, at the very same time, Holmes also appeared in various\nGerman-language film adaptations, some of which were said to have been\nmuch-loved favorites of Adolf Hitler. So let's return to our question. Would the real Sherlock Holmes\nplease stand up? The truth is that this world of adaptation\nhas made him into a palimpsest. Sherlock is a cultural text, repeatedly altered over time as each new\ninterpretation becomes superimposed over those that proceed it. This means that Sherlock \ncontinually evolves, embodying ideas and values \noften far removed from those found in Conan Doyle. And after each particular story ends,\nSherlock rises again, a little changed, perhaps, with a new face and fresh mannerisms\nor turns of phrase, but still essentially Sherlock,\nour Sherlock. "

        "text": "The finish line's in sight\nand you put on an extra burst of speed. As your legs pick up the pace,\nyour breathing gets deeper, your heart pounds faster, and sweat pours over your skin. How does this substance\nsuddenly materialize and what exactly is its purpose? There are a number of scenarios\nthat can make us sweat: eating spicy foods, nervousness, and when we're sick. But exercise is probably the most familiar\nand common. In that case, sweating happens \nas a response to movement triggered deep inside your cells. As you increase your pace,\nyour muscles work harder, increasing their demand for energy. A process called cellular respiration consumes glucose \nand oxygen to form ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Much of this process takes place\nin structures called mitochondria. The more you move, the harder mitochondria work\nto supply your body with energy. All this work comes at a cost, though. As the cells break down the ATP,\nthey release heat. The heat stimulates temperature sensors\nthroughout your body. Those receptors detect the excess heat\nbeing produced by your muscle cells and communicate that information\nto the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature. The hypothalamus responds by sending signals out through \nthe sympathetic nervous system to the sweat glands in your skin. These are distributed all over the body with especially high concentrations\non the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet, and on your head. When a sweat gland first receives\nthe signal, the fluid surrounding the cells\nin its coiled base contains high amounts \nof sodium and chloride. The cells pump these ions\ninto a hollow tube that runs through the sweat gland. Then, because it's saltier inside\nthe tube than outside, water moves into the tube by osmosis. As what's called the primary secretion\nbuilds up in the bottom of the tube, water pressure pushes it up\ninto the long straight part of the duct. Before it seeps onto the skin, cells lining the tube will reclaim\nas much salt as possible so the process can continue. The water in sweat absorbs \nyour body's heat energy and then evaporates off of you\nwhen it reaches the surface, which in turn lowers your temperature. This process, \nknown as evaporative cooling, was an important adaptation \nfor our ancestors. This cooling effect isn't only helpful\nduring exercise. We sweat in many other scenarios, too. Eating particularly spicy food makes some\npeople sweat profusely from their faces. That happens because spices trigger\nthe same neural response in the brain that activates temperature receptors,\nwhich usually respond to increased heat. Sweating is also part of \nthe fight or flight response stimulated by stressful scenarios,\nlike asking someone on a date or interviewing for a job. This happens because adrenaline\nstimulates muscle activity and causes blood vessels to widen, two responses that increase heat\nand trigger the sweating response. And sweating also occurs \nwhen we get sick. When we're feverish,\nwe sweat because infections stimulate the hypothalamus \nto increase muscle activity, which in turn releases \nmore energy as heat. That increases your overall temperature, a protective mechanism that makes your\nbody less habitable for infectious agents. Like with running, sweating helps\nyour body vent that heat. When the fever's over \nor you've won your race, your temperature receptors \nsense the decrease in heat and the hypothalamus brings \nyour sweating response to an end. In some cases, like after a run, the hypothalamus also signals\nto your body that you need to replenish the water\nthat you've oozed out. So, when you're pushing yourself\nto reach that next goal, you can think of sweat as your body's\nvery own calibrator, enabling you to go that extra mile. "

        "text": "In 1796, the scientist Edward Jenner injected material from a cowpox virus\ninto an eight-year-old boy with a hunch that this would provide\nthe protection needed to save people from deadly outbreaks\nof the related smallpox virus. It was a success. The eight-year-old was inoculated\nagainst the disease and this became the first ever vaccine. But why did it work? To understand how vaccines function, we need to know how the immune system\ndefends us against contagious diseases in the first place. When foreign microbes invade us, the immune system triggers\na series of responses in an attempt to identify\nand remove them from our bodies. The signs that this immune\nresponse is working are the coughing, sneezing,\ninflammation and fever we experience, which work to trap, deter and rid the body\nof threatening things, like bacteria. These innate immune responses\nalso trigger our second line of defense, called adaptive immunity. Special cells called B cells and T cells\nare recruited to fight microbes, and also record information about them, creating a memory of what\nthe invaders look like, and how best to fight them. This know-how becomes handy if the same pathogen\ninvades the body again. But despite this smart response,\nthere's still a risk involved. The body takes time to learn\nhow to respond to pathogens and to build up these defenses. And even then, if a body is too weak or young\nto fight back when it's invaded, it might face very serious risk\nif the pathogen is particularly severe. But what if we could prepare\nthe body's immune response, readying it before someone even got ill? This is where vaccines come in. Using the same principles\nthat the body uses to defend itself, scientists use vaccines to trigger\nthe body's adaptive immune system, without exposing humans\nto the full strength disease. This has resulted in many vaccines,\nwhich each work uniquely, separated into many different types. First, we have live attenuated vaccines. These are made of the pathogen itself\nbut a much weaker and tamer version. Next, we have inactive vaccines,\nin which the pathogens have been killed. The weakening and inactivation\nin both types of vaccine ensures that pathogens don't develop\ninto the full blown disease. But just like a disease,\nthey trigger an immune response, teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile\nof pathogens in preparation. The downside is that live attenuated\nvaccines can be difficult to make, and because they're live\nand quite powerful, people with weaker immune systems\ncan't have them, while inactive vaccines\ndon't create long-lasting immunity. Another type, the subunit vaccine, is only made from one part\nof the pathogen, called an antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers\nthe immune response. By even further isolating\nspecific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt\nspecific responses. Scientists are now building\na whole new range of vaccines called DNA vaccines. For this variety, they isolate the very\ngenes that make the specific antigens the body needs to trigger its immune\nresponse to specific pathogens. When injected into the human body, those genes instruct cells\nin the body to make the antigens. This causes a stronger immune response, and prepares the body\nfor any future threats, and because the vaccine only includes\nspecific genetic material, it doesn't contain any other ingredients\nfrom the rest of the pathogen that could develop into the disease\nand harm the patient. If these vaccines become a success, we might be able to build\nmore effective treatments for invasive pathogens in years to come. Just like Edward Jenner's\namazing discovery spurred on modern medicine\nall those decades ago, continuing the development of vaccines might even allow us\nto treat diseases like HIV, malaria, or Ebola, one day.

        "text": "When a team of archaeologists\nrecently came across some 15,000 year-old human remains, they made an interesting discovery. The teeth of those ancient humans\nwere riddled with holes. Their cavities were caused by the same\nthing that still plagues us today, specific tiny microbes \nthat live in our mouths. These microbes are with us\nsoon after birth. We typically pick them up as babies\nfrom our mothers' mouths. And as our teeth erupt, they naturally begin to accumulate\ncommunities of bacteria. Depending on what we eat, and specifically how much sugar\nwe consume, certain microbes can overpopulate\nand cause cavities. Diets high in sugary foods cause\nan explosion of bacteria called mutans streptococci\nin our mouths. Like humans, these microorganisms\nlove sugar, using it as a molecular building block\nand energy source. As they consume it, the bacteria generate byproducts\nin the form of acids, such as lactic acid. Mutans streptococci are resistant\nto this acid, but unfortunately, our teeth aren't. While each human tooth is coated\nin a hardy, protective layer of enamel, it's no match for acid. That degrades the armor over time,\nleaching away its calcium minerals. Gradually, acid wears down a pathway\nfor bacteria into the tooth's secondary layer\ncalled the dentin. Since blood vessels and nerves\nin our teeth are enclosed deep within, at this stage, the expanding cavity\ndoesn't hurt. But if the damage extends \nbeyond the dentin, the bacterial invasion progresses causing excruciating pain\nas the nerves become exposed. Without treatment, the whole tooth\nmay become infected and require removal all due to those sugar-loving bacteria. The more sugar our food contains, the more our teeth are put at risk. Those cavemen would hardly\nhave indulged in sugary treats, however, so what caused their cavities? In meat-heavy diets, there would have\nbeen a low-risk of cavities developing because lean meat \ncontains very little sugar, but that's not all our early human\nancestors ate. Cavemen would also have consumed\nroot vegetables, nuts, and grains, all of which contain carbohydrates. When exposed to enzymes in the saliva, carbohydrates get broken down\ninto simpler sugars, which can become the fodder\nfor those ravenous mouth bacteria. So while ancient humans did eat\nless sugar compared to us, their teeth were still exposed to sugars. That doesn't mean they were unable\nto treat their cavities, though. Archaeological remains show that\nabout 14,000 years ago, humans were already using sharpened flint\nto remove bits of rotten teeth. Ancient humans even made\nrudimentary drills to smooth out the rough holes left behind and beeswax to plug cavities,\nlike modern-day fillings. Today, we have much more sophisticated\ntechniques and tools, which is fortunate because we also need\nto contend with our more damaging, sugar-guzzling ways. After the Industrial Revolution,\nthe human incidence of cavities surged because suddenly \nwe had technological advances that made refined sugar cheaper\nand accessible. Today, an incredible 92% of American \nadults have had cavities in their teeth. Some people are more susceptible \nto cavities due to genes that may cause certain weaknesses,\nlike softer enamel, but for most, high sugar consumption\nis to blame. However, we have developed other ways\nof minimizing cavities besides reducing our intake of sugar\nand starch. In most toothpastes \nand many water supplies, we use tiny amounts of fluoride. That strengthens teeth and encourages\nthe growth of enamel crystals that build up a tooth's defenses\nagainst acid. When cavities do develop, we use tooth fillings to fill \nand close off the infected area, preventing them from getting worse. The best way to avoid a cavity\nis still cutting down on sugar intake and practicing good oral hygiene to get rid of the bacteria \nand their food sources. That includes regular tooth brushing, flossing, and avoiding sugary, starchy, and sticky foods that cling to your teeth\nbetween meals. Gradually, the population of sugar-loving\nmicrobes in your mouth will decline. Unlike the cavemen of yesteryear, today we have the knowledge required\nto avert a cavity calamity. We just need to use it. "

In your body, oxygen forms a vital role in the production of energy in most cells. But if gases can only efficiently diffuse across tiny distances, how does oxygen reach the cells deep inside your body? Enda Butler tracks the surprisingly complex journey of oxygen through your body.\n\nLesson by Enda Butler, animation by Compote Collective.",
        "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GVU_zANtroE/hqdefault.jpg",
        "text": "You breathe in about 17,000 times per day. It's a process you rarely think about, but behind the scenes, a huge coordinated\neffort is playing out. Your vital organs, the gut, brain, bones, lungs, blood, and heart work together to sustain your life by delivering oxygen\nto tissues throughout your body. Most of our cells need oxygen because it's one of the key ingredients\nof aerobic respiration. That's the process that produces\na molecule called ATP, which our cells use to power their\nmany incredible functions. But getting oxygen throughout our\nbodies is a surprisingly difficult task. Gas enters cells by diffusing in\nfrom their surroundings. And that only happens efficiently\nover tiny distances. So for oxygen to reach the cells\nwithin our bodies, it needs a transportation network. This is where our 20 trillion \nred blood cells come in. Each one contains about 270 million\noxygen-binding molecules of hemoglobin, which is what gives blood its scarlet hue. To make these cells, the body uses\nraw materials that become available from\nthe food we eat. So in some ways, you could say\nthat oxygen's journey through the body really begins in the gut. Here, in an amazing display of mechanical\nand chemical digestion, food gets broken down into\nits smallest elements, like iron, the building block\nof hemoglobin. Iron is carried through \nthe cardiovascular system to the body's hematopoietic tissue. This tissue is the birthplace \nof red blood cells, and it can be found enclosed within\nour bone marrow cavities. The kidneys regulate \nour levels of red blood cells through the release of erythropoietin, a hormone which causes marrow\nto increase production. Our bodies churn out roughly 2.5 million\nred blood cells per second, a number equivalent to the entire\npopulation of Paris, so that oxygen that makes it to the lungs\nwill have ample transportation. But before oxygen \ncan even reach the lungs, the brain needs to get involved. The brainstem initiates breathing by sending a message\nthrough your nervous system, all the way to muscles \nof the diaphragm and ribs. This causes them to contract, thus increasing the space\ninside the rib cage, which allows the lungs to expand. That expansion drops your lungs\ninternal air pressure, making air rush in. It's tempting to think of our lungs\nas two big balloons, but they're actually a lot more \ncomplicated than that. Here's why. The red blood cells in the vessels\nwithin your lungs can only pick up oxygen molecules\nthat are very close to them. If our lungs were shaped like balloons, air that was not in direct contact\nwith the balloon's inner surface couldn't diffuse through. Luckily, our lungs' architecture ensures\nthat very little oxygen is wasted. Their interior is divided into\nhundreds of millions of miniature balloon-like projections\ncalled alveoli that dramatically increase \nthe contact area to somewhere around 100 square meters. The alveolar walls are made of\nextremely thin flat cells that are surrounded by capillaries. Together, the alveolar wall and\ncapillaries make a two-cell thick membrane that brings blood and oxygen close enough\nfor diffusion. These oxygen-enriched cells are then\ncarried from the lungs through the cardiovascular network, a massive collection of blood vessels\nthat reaches every cell in the body. If we laid this system out\nend to end in a straight line, the vessels would wrap around the Earth\nseveral times. Propelling red blood cells\nthrough this extensive network requires a pretty powerful pump, and that's where your heart comes in. The human heart pumps an average\nof about 100,000 times per day, and it's the powerhouse that ultimately\ngets oxygen where it needs to go, completing the body's team effort. Just think - this entire complex system\nis built around the delivery of tiny molecules of oxygen. If just one part malfunctioned,\nso would we. Breathe in. Your gut, brain, bones, \nlungs, blood, and heart are continuing their incredible act\nof coordination that keeps you alive. Breathe out. "

Have you ever presented an idea to\na group and it's met with utter confusion? Or maybe you've been in an argument when the other person suddenly accuses you of not listening \nto what they're saying at all? What's going on here? The answer is miscommunication, and in some form or another, we've all experienced it. It can lead to confusion, animosity, misunderstanding, or even crashing a multimillion\ndollar probe into the surface of Mars. The fact is even when face-to-face\nwith another person, in the very same room, and speaking the same language, human communication is incredibly complex. But the good news is \nthat a basic understanding of what happens when we communicate can help us prevent miscommunication. For decades, researchers have asked,\n\"What happens when we communicate?\" One interpretation,\ncalled the transmission model, views communication as a message that\nmoves directly from one person to another, similar to someone tossing a ball\nand walking away. But in reality, this simplistic model doesn't account\nfor communication's complexity. Enter the transactional model, which acknowledges the many \nadded challenges of communicating. With this model, it's more accurate\nto think of communication between people as a game of catch. As we communicate our message,\nwe receive feedback from the other party. Through the transaction,\nwe create meaning together. But from this exchange,\nfurther complications arise. It's not like the Star Trek universe, where some characters \ncan Vulcan mind meld, fully sharing thoughts and feelings. As humans, we can't help but send\nand receive messages through our own subjective lenses. When communicating, one person expresses\nher interpretation of a message, and the person she's communicating with hears his own interpretation \nof that message. Our perceptual filters continually shift\nmeanings and interpretations. Remember that game of catch? Imagine it with a lump of clay. As each person touches it, they shape it to fit \ntheir own unique perceptions based on any number of variables, like knowledge or past experience, \nage, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or family background. Simultaneously, every person interprets\nthe message they receive based on their relationship \nwith the other person, and their unique understanding of the semantics and connotations \nof the exact words being used. They could also be distracted\nby other stimuli, such as traffic or a growling stomach. Even emotion might cloud \ntheir understanding, and by adding more people\ninto a conversation, each with their own subjectivities, the complexity of communication\ngrows exponentially. So as the lump of clay goes back and forth\nfrom one person to another, reworked, reshaped, and always changing, it's no wonder our messages sometimes\nturn into a mush of miscommunication. But, luckily, there are some \nsimple practices that can help us all navigate our daily\ninteractions for better communication. One: recognize that passive hearing\nand active listening are not the same. Engage actively with the verbal\nand nonverbal feedback of others, and adjust your message to facilitate\ngreater understanding. Two: listen with your eyes and ears,\nas well as with your gut. Remember that communication \nis more than just words. Three: take time to understand as you try\nto be understood. In the rush to express ourselves, it's easy to forget that communication\nis a two-way street. Be open to what \nthe other person might say. And finally, four: Be aware of your personal \nperceptual filters. Elements of your experience, including your culture, \ncommunity, and family, influence how you see the world. Say, \"This is how I see the problem,\nbut how do you see it?\" Don't assume that your perception\nis the objective truth. That'll help you work toward sharing\na dialogue with others to reach a common understanding together. "

        "text": "Aristotle famously said,\n\"Nature fears of empty space\" when he claimed that a true vacuum, \na space devoid of matter, could not exist because the surrounding matter\nwould immediately fill it. Fortunately, he turned out to be wrong. A vacuum is a key component\nof the barometer, an instrument for measuring air pressure. And because air pressure \ncorrelates to temperature and rapid shifts in it can contribute to hurricanes, tornadoes \nand other extreme weather events, a barometer is one of the\nmost essential tools  for weather forecasters and scientists alike. How does a barometer work,\nand how was it invented? Well, it took awhile. Because the theory of Aristotle \nand other ancient philosophers regarding the impossibility of a vacuum\nseemed to hold true in everyday life, few seriously thought to question it\nfor nearly 2,000 years -- until necessity raised the issue. In the early 17th century,\nItalian miners faced a serious problem when they found that their pumps\ncould not raise water  more than 10.3 meters high. Some scientists at the time,\nincluding one Galileo Galilei, proposed that sucking air out of the pipe\nwas what made water rise to replace the void. But that its force was limited and could lift\nno more than 10.3 meters of water. However, the idea of a \nvacuum existing at all was still considered controversial. And the excitement over \nGalileo's unorthodox theory, led Gasparo Berti to conduct a simple\nbut brilliant experiment to demonstrate that it was possible. A long tube was filled with water and placed standing in a shallow pool \nwith both ends plugged. The bottom end of the tube \nwas then opened and water poured out into the basin until the level of the water remaining \nin the tube was 10.3 meters. With a gap remaining at the top,\nand no air having entered the tube, Berti had succeeded in\ndirectly creating a stable vacuum. But even though the possibility \nof a vacuum had been demonstrated, not everyone was satisfied \nwith Galileo's idea that this empty void \nwas exerting some mysterious yet finite force on the water. Evangelista Torricelli, \nGalileo's young pupil and friend, decided to look at the problem\nfrom a different angle. Instead of focusing on the \nempty space inside the tube, he asked himself,\n\"What else could be influencing the water?\" Because the only thing in contact \nwith the water was the air surrounding the pool, he believed the pressure from this air\ncould be the only thing preventing the water level in the tube\nfrom dropping further. He realized that the experiment \nwas not only a tool to create a vacuum, but operated as a balance between the atmospheric pressure\non the water outside the tube and the pressure from the\nwater column inside the tube. The water level in the tube decreases\nuntil the two pressures are equal, which just happens to be\nwhen the water is at 10.3 meters. This idea was not easily accepted, as Galileo and others \nhad traditionally thought that atmospheric air has no weight\nand exerts no pressure. Torricelli decided to \nrepeat Berti's experiment with mercury instead of water. Because mercury was denser, \nit fell farther than the water and the mercury column stood\nonly about 76 centimeters tall. Not only did this allow Torricelli to make\nthe instrument much more compact, it supported his idea that weight\nwas the deciding factor. A variation on the experiment used two tubes\nwith one having a large bubble at the top. If Galileo's interpretation had been correct,\nthe bigger vacuum in the second tube should have exerted more suction\nand lifted the mercury higher. But the level in both tubes was the same. The ultimate support for Torricelli's theory\ncame via Blaise Pascal who had such a mercury tube\ntaken up a mountain and showed that the mercury level dropped as the atmospheric pressure\ndecreased with altitude. Mercury barometers based on \nTorricelli's original model remained one of the most common ways\nto measure atmospheric pressure until 2007 when restrictions on the use of\nmercury due to its toxicity led to them no longer\nbeing produced in Europe. Nevertheless, Torricelli's invention, born of the willingness to question\nlong accepted dogmas about vacuums and the weight of air,\nis an outstanding example of how thinking outside of the box\n-- or the tube -- can have a heavy impact.

        "text": "Ethic and her robot Hedge agree \nto help the resistance leader, Adila, sabotage the art-incinerating \nfurnace-bots. In exchange, Adila promises to lead them \nto the first object of Ethic’s quest, an artifact called the Node of Power. Years ago, there was just \none furnace-bot. It had a 0 inside its furnace \nand an unknown, randomly generated serial number. Over time, the original self-replicated \nto produce more identical furnace-bots. Each child inherited the original’s \nunknown serial number within its furnace, and had a random, unique serial \nnumber of its own inscribed on its shell. The second generation of furnace-\nbots also self-replicated in the same way, always passing their own serial \nnumbers to their offspring’s furnaces. This continued on for many generations. Today, each furnace-bot receives \nits orders from its parent. So if Ethic can find the original 0 bot\nand somehow change its instructions, she could take over \nthe entire army, all at once. Adila has the perfect solution: a data crystal that she’s \nbeen carrying for years, waiting for the right moment \nto activate it. It contains a program designed \nto gain control of a bot and give it new instructions. But if it’s uploaded to any furnace-\nbot other than the original, the 0 bot will override \nthe instructions and destroy the data crystal \nin the process. The feeding is just \na few minutes away, and there’s only one \nchance to get this right. Fortunately, Hedge’s ability \nto store data can help. In programming, a piece of information gets \nstored in something called a variable. Variables are basically containers that \nhold onto numbers, words, or other values. How does Ethic program Hedge to find \nthe original 0 bot as quickly as possible? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Here’s a hint. Programs can be written to have \nas many variables as you need, but you can solve this problem \nwith just one. Hedge can use it to store \na serial number and replace it with a new one \nas often as he needs. Pause now to figure it out for yourself. A key insight here is that Hedge \ndoesn’t need to map out the entire set of relationships to find \nthe original furnace-bot. If, for example, he gets lucky and picks \nthe original one right away, he’ll be done. But if he starts with any other bot, he can still find a path that leads \nstraight back to the 0-bot by following a simple set of instructions. To help craft them, let’s first \nsimplify the problem. Let’s say there were only \nthree furnace-bots; a parent and two children, but you don’t \nknow which is which. You could have Hedge pick one \nat random and look inside its furnace. Now, you know the family tree \nlooks like this. If the number inside the furnace is a 0, \nyou’ve found the parent. If not, then no matter \nwhich child you chose, it must have the parent’s serial \nnumber in its furnace. So in this scenario, you’re guaranteed \nto find the parent in one or two moves. In actuality, there are many \nfurnace-bots, and you don’t know how \nmany generations there are nor what the family tree looks like. But you don’t need to, because Hedge can just keep repeating \nthe same sequence of actions until he gets to the original. How? With a loop. Hedge can pick any bot at random, \nlook inside its furnace, and store that serial \nnumber as a variable. Then he’ll begin the following \nloop that will repeat until the stored variable equals 0, the furnace number of the original bot: 1. Find the bot whose shell serial number \nmatches the stored number. 2. Look inside its furnace. 3. Store that new number, \noverwriting the old one. Once the loop ends, we’ll know \nthat Hedge has found the 0 bot, so he should upload the control program. So here’s what happens: Hedge only takes 5 repetitions \nto find the original: robot 733 has the 0 in its furnace. In a blink of a mechanical eye, the program spreads through the entire \narmy, and Adila takes control. She has the furnace-bots \ngive off theatrical bouts of flame to hide the fact that they’re now secretly\nsafe-guarding all of that artistic output. Now that Ethic’s delivered \nthe furnace-bots, Adila honors her end of the deal. She leads Ethic and Hedge \nto the location of the first artifact, the Node of Power. There, one thing is immediately clear: they’ll have to steal it. "

        "text": "How did Adolf Hitler, a tyrant who orchestrated one of the\nlargest genocides in human history, rise to power in a democratic country? The story begins at the end\nof World War I. With the successful \nAllied advance in 1918, Germany realized the war was unwinnable and signed an armistice \nending the fighting. As its imperial government collapsed, civil unrest and worker strikes\nspread across the nation. Fearing a Communist revolution, major parties joined \nto suppress the uprisings, establishing the parliamentary\nWeimar Republic. One of the new government's first tasks was implementing the peace treaty\nimposed by the Allies. In addition to losing over a tenth\nof its territory and dismantling its army, Germany had to accept full responsibility\nfor the war and pay reparations, debilitating its already weakened economy. All this was seen as a humiliation\nby many nationalists and veterans. They wrongly believed the war \ncould have been won if the army hadn't been betrayed\nby politicians and protesters. For Hitler, these views became obsession, and his bigotry and paranoid delusions\nled him to pin the blame on Jews. His words found resonance in a society\nwith many anti-Semitic people. By this time, hundreds \nof thousands of Jews had integrated into German society, but many Germans continued to perceive\nthem as outsiders. After World War I, Jewish success led\nto ungrounded accusations of subversion and war profiteering. It can not be stressed enough that these\nconspiracy theories were born out of fear, anger, and bigotry, not fact. Nonetheless, Hitler found \nsuccess with them. When he joined a small nationalist\npolitical party, his manipulative public speaking\nlaunched him into its leadership and drew increasingly larger crowds. Combining anti-Semitism with \npopulist resentment, the Nazis denounced both Communism\nand Capitalism as international Jewish conspiracies\nto destroy Germany. The Nazi party was not initially popular. After they made an unsuccessful attempt\nat overthrowing the government, the party was banned, and Hitler jailed for treason. But upon his release about a year later, he immediately began to rebuild\nthe movement. And then, in 1929, \nthe Great Depression happened. It led to American banks withdrawing\ntheir loans from Germany, and the already struggling German economy\ncollapsed overnight. Hitler took advantage \nof the people's anger, offering them convenient scapegoats and a promise to restore Germany's\nformer greatness. Mainstream parties proved\nunable to handle the crisis while left-wing opposition was too\nfragmented by internal squabbles. And so some of the frustrated public\nflocked to the Nazis, increasing their parliamentary votes from\nunder 3% to over 18% in just two years. In 1932, Hitler ran for president, losing the election to decorated war hero\nGeneral von Hindenburg. But with 36% of the vote, Hitler had\ndemonstrated the extent of his support. The following year, advisors \nand business leaders convinced Hindenburg to appoint Hitler\nas Chancellor, hoping to channel his popularity\nfor their own goals. Though the Chancellor was only\nthe administrative head of parliament, Hitler steadily expanded the power\nof his position. While his supporters formed \nparamilitary groups and fought protestors in streets. Hitler raised fears \nof a Communist uprising and argued that only he could restore\nlaw and order. Then in 1933, a young worker was convicted of\nsetting fire to the parliament building. Hitler used the event to convince\nthe government to grant him emergency powers. Within a matter of months,\nfreedom of the press was abolished, other parties were disbanded, and anti-Jewish laws were passed. Many of Hitler's early radical supporters\nwere arrested and executed, along with potential rivals, and when President Hindenburg died\nin August 1934, it was clear there would be \nno new election. Disturbingly, many of Hitler's early \nmeasures didn't require mass repression. His speeches exploited \npeople's fear and ire to drive their support behind him\nand the Nazi party. Meanwhile, businessmen and intellectuals, wanting to be on the right side \nof public opinion, endorsed Hitler. They assured themselves and each other that his more extreme rhetoric \nwas only for show. Decades later, Hitler's rise remains \na warning of how fragile democratic institutions\ncan be in the face of angry crowds and a leader willing to feed their anger\nand exploit their fears. "

        "text": "In the spring of 1947, six Scandinavian\nexplorers noticed a strange phenomenon while crossing the Pacific Ocean. Somehow, small squid \nknown to live deep beneath the waves kept appearing on the roof of their boat. The crew was mystified— until they saw the squids soaring\nabove the sea for roughly 50 meters. On land, people could barely believe\nthe explorers. It seemed impossible that sea creatures\nwithout wings or bones could fly at all, let alone travel half the length \nof a football field. But over the next several decades,\nmore reports began to surface. Sailors described airborne squid keeping\npace with motor boats. Researchers reported captive squid\nescaping their tanks overnight. And as cameras became widespread,\nseafarers finally began capturing proof of these high-flying cephalopods. But how and why do \nthese marine creatures take to the sky? While only a few squid species \nhave been recorded taking flight, most squid are alike in the way \nthey traverse the ocean. The outside of a squid’s body is a massive\ntube of muscle called the mantle. Water enters that tube through small\nopenings around the squid’s head. Then, muscles clamp \nthese openings shut, and the squid forcefully pumps the water\nthrough the base of their body. In practice, this makes the mantle\na miniature jetpack, propelling squid through the water \nat 10 kilometers per hour. This process is also how squid breathe. Squid gills rest inside the mantle, and siphon oxygen from the water\nbeing pushed past them. With gills full of air \nand a mantle full of water, squid can outpace predators \nand pursue their prey. Or, in the case of some species, they can \nsmash through the ocean’s surface, and attempt an epic flight. Without the resistance of water, a squid’s acceleration \nis the same as a car going from zero to 100 kilometers \nper hour in just over a second. At speeds of 40 kilometers per hour, \nsquid quickly generate aerodynamic lift. But to stay in the air they’ll need\nsomething like wings. Fortunately, our soaring cephalopod\nhas a plan. Squid tentacles are \"muscular hydrostats,\"\nmeaning the tissue can be held firm by muscle tension. Splaying its tentacles \nin a rigid formation, the squid transforms them \ninto flexible wing-like structures that stabilise its flight. At the opposite end of its body, two fins\ntypically used for gentle swimming find new purpose as a second set of wings. And by folding these fins down, a squid can streamline itself\nand dip back into the ocean. There have been too few observations to establish what a squid’s \ntypical flight trajectory looks like. Based on their flying speed, \na 10 centimeter squid could hypothetically launch itself \nsix meters above the water. But from what scientists have seen,\nflying squid tend to glide low, keeping close to the surface. This trajectory allows squid to cover\nthe most horizontal distance possible over a typical several second flight. It also makes it easy to dive back \ninto the water for more fuel— or to make a quick escape \nfrom predatory birds. But why do squids fly at all? Leading theories suggest that flight\nis an escape behaviour, as flying squid generally seem \nto be fleeing a nearby predator or ship. Other researchers think their flight may be an energy-saving\nmigration strategy, because it takes less energy to move\nquickly through the air than through water. However, it’s also possible\nthat learning to fly may be a vital part\nof surviving adolescence. Young, smaller squid can potentially\nfly faster and farther than their larger relatives. And since adult squid tend \nto cannibalize juveniles, soaring above the surf can help ensure\nthese young squid will live to fly another day. "

        "text": "Say two people are walking down the street, and they bump into each other. They'll just shake it off and walk on. Sometimes that happens with molecules too. They just bounce off each other, and that's that. But what if two people were to bump into each other, and during that collision, one person's arm got severed and reattached to the other person's face? Now that sounds really weird, but it's similar to one of the many ways that molecules can react with each other. Two molecules can join and become one. One can split apart and become two. Molecules can switch parts. All these changes are chemical reactions, and we can see them happening around us. For example, when fireworks explode, or iron rusts, or milk goes bad, or people are born, grow old, die, and then decompose. But chemical reactions don't just happen willy nilly! Everything has to be right. First, the molecules have to hit each other in the right orientation. And second, they have to hit each other hard enough, in other words, with enough energy. Now you're probably thinking that a reaction just happens in one direction and that's it. Sometimes that's true. For example, things can't unburn or unexplode. But most reactions can happen in both directions, forward and reverse. There's no reason that our face-arm guy can't bump into armless girl, reattaching that arm back to its original socket. Now let's zoom out a bit. Now let's say that you've got a thousand people on the street, and all of them start with their limbs normally attached. At the beginning, every collision is a chance for Person A to transfer an arm to Person B's face. And so at the beginning, more and more people end up with arms attached to their faces or arms missing. But as the number of people with arm-faces and missing arms grows, collisions between those people become more likely. And when they bump into each other, guess what? Normal-appendage people are reproduced. Now the number of limb transfers per second forward will start high and then fall, and the number of limb transfers per second backward will start at zero and then rise. Eventually they'll meet, they'll be the same. And when that happens, the number of people in each state stops changing, even though people are still bumping into each other and exchanging limbs. Now how many people do you think there are in each state? Half and half, right? No, well, maybe. It depends. It could be 50/50, but it could be 60/40 or 15/85, or anything. We chemists have to get our little, gloved hands dirty - ah, well, we're in a lab so not really dirty - to figure out what the actual distribution of molecules is. Even though each of limb transfers is a pretty dramatic event for the people involved, if we zoom out, we see population numbers that don't change. We call this nirvana equilibrium, and it doesn't just happen with chemical reactions. Things like gene pools and highway traffic show the same pattern. It looks pretty still from 30,000 feet, but there is lots of crazy stuff happening on the ground, you just need to zoom in to see it. "

        "text": "How do you get what you want\nusing just your words? Aristotle set out to answer exactly\nthat question over 2,000 years ago with the Treatise on Rhetoric. Rhetoric, according to Aristotle, is the art of seeing the available\nmeans of persuasion. And today we apply it to\nany form of communication. Aristotle focused on oration, though, and he described three types\nof persuasive speech. Forensic, or judicial, rhetoric establishes facts \nand judgements about the past, similar to detectives at a crime scene. Epideictic, or demonstrative, rhetoric makes a proclamation \nabout the present situation, as in wedding speeches. But the way to accomplish change\nis through deliberative rhetoric, or symbouleutikon. Rather than the past or the present, deliberative rhetoric\nfocuses on the future. It's the rhetoric of politicians debating a new law by imagining \nwhat effect it might have, like when Ronald Regan warned\nthat the introduction of Medicare would lead to a socialist future \nspent telling our children and our children's children what it once\nwas like in America when men were free. But it's also the rhetoric of activists\nurging change, such as Martin Luther King Jr's dream that his children will one day live\nin a nation where they will not be judged\nby the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. In both cases, the speaker's present\ntheir audience with a possible future and try to enlist their help\nin avoiding or achieving it. But what makes \nfor good deliberative rhetoric, besides the future tense? According to Aristotle, there are three\npersuasive appeals: ethos, logos, and pathos. Ethos is how you convince an audience\nof your credibility. Winston Churchill began his 1941 address\nto the U.S. Congress by declaring, \"I have been in full harmony all my life\nwith the tides which have flowed on both sides of the Atlantic\nagainst privilege and monopoly,\" thus highlighting his virtue\nas someone committed to democracy. Much earlier, in his defense \nof the poet Archias, Roman consul Cicero appealed to\nhis own practical wisdom and expertise as a politician: \"Drawn from my study \nof the liberal sciences and from that careful training\nto which I admit that at no part of my life I have ever\nbeen disinclined.\" And finally, you can demonstrate\ndisinterest, or that you're not motivated \nby personal gain. Logos is the use of logic and reason. This method can employ rhetorical devices\nsuch as analogies, examples, and citations of research or statistics. But it's not just facts and figures. It's also the structure and content\nof the speech itself. The point is to use factual knowledge\nto convince the audience, as in Sojourner Truth's argument\nfor women's rights: \"I have as much muscle as any man\nand can do as much work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked\nand chopped and mowed and can any man do more than that?\" Unfortunately, speakers can also \nmanipulate people with false information that the audience thinks is true, such as the debunked but still widely\nbelieved claim that vaccines cause autism. And finally, pathos appeals to emotion, and in our age of mass media,\nit's often the most effective mode. Pathos is neither inherently good nor bad, but it may be irrational \nand unpredictable. It can just as easily rally \npeople for peace as incite them to war. Most advertising, from beauty products that promise\nto relieve our physical insecurities to cars that make us feel powerful, relies on pathos. Aristotle's rhetorical appeals \nstill remain powerful tools today, but deciding which of them to use is a matter of knowing \nyour audience and purpose, as well as the right place and time. And perhaps just as important is being\nable to notice when these same methods of persuasion\nare being used on you. "

        "text": "Translator: tom carter\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The periodic table is instantly recognizable. It's not just in every chemistry lab worldwide, it's found on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and shower curtains. But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon. It's a massive slab of human genius, up there with the Taj Mahal, the Mona Lisa, and the ice cream sandwich -- and the table's creator, Dmitri Mendeleev, is a bonafide science hall-of-famer. But why? What's so great about him and his table? Is it because he made a comprehensive list of the known elements? Nah, you don't earn a spot in science Valhalla just for making a list. Besides, Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that. Is it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together? Not really, that had already been done too. So what was Mendeleev's genius? Let's look at one of the first versions of the periodic table from around 1870. Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbols arranged in a table. Check out the entry of the third column, fifth row. There's a dash there. From that unassuming placeholder springs the raw brilliance of Mendeleev. That dash is science. By putting that dash there, Dmitri was making a bold statement. He said -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- Y'all haven't discovered this element yet. In the meantime, I'm going to give it a name. It's one step away from aluminum, so we'll call it eka-aluminum, \"eka\" being Sanskrit for one. Nobody's found eka-aluminum yet, so we don't know anything about it, right? Wrong! Based on where it's located, I can tell you all about it. First of all, an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68, about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom. When eka-aluminum is isolated, you'll see it's a solid metal at room temperature. It's shiny, it conducts heat really well, it can be flattened into a sheet, stretched into a wire, but its melting point is low. Like, freakishly low. Oh, and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams. Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was, and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave. A few years after this prediction, a French guy named Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered a new element in ore samples and named it gallium after Gaul, the historical name for France. Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table. It's eka-aluminum. So were Mendeleev's predictions right? Gallium's atomic weight is 69.72. A cubic centimeter of it weighs 5.9 grams. it's a solid metal at room temperature, but it melts at a paltry 30 degrees Celcius, 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It melts in your mouth and in your hand. Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium, he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time: scandium, germanium, rhenium. The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetium. Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was synthesized in a cyclotron in 1937, almost 70 years after Dmitri predicted its existence, 30 years after he died. Dmitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907, but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor. In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element. This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101, and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963. There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winners, but only 15 scientists have an element named after them. So the next time you stare at a periodic table, whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug, Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, will be staring back.

        "text": "For as long as we’ve had language,\nsome people have tried to control it. And some of the most frequent targets \nof this communication regulation are the ums, ers, and likes \nthat pepper our conversations. Ancient Greek and Latin texts warned\nagainst speaking with hesitation, modern schools have tried \nto ban the offending terms, and renowned linguist Noam Chomsky\ndismissed these expressions as “errors” irrelevant to language. Historically, these speech components\nhad been lumped into the broader bucket of “disfluencies”— linguistic fillers which distract \nfrom useful speech. However, none of this controversy has made\nthese so-called disfluencies less common. They continue to occur roughly \n2 to 3 times per minute in natural speech. And different versions of them can\nbe found in almost every language, including sign language. So are ums and uhs \njust a habit we can’t break? Or is there more to them\nthan meets the ear? To answer this question, it helps \nto compare these speech components to other words we use in everyday life. While a written word might have\nmultiple definitions, we can usually determine its intended\nmeaning through context. In speech however, a word can take\non additional layers of meaning. Tone of voice, \nthe relationship between speakers, and expectations of where \na conversation will go can imbue even words that seem like filler\nwith vital information. This is where “um” and “uh” come in. Or “eh” and “ehm,” “tutoa” and “öö,”\n“eto” and “ano.” Linguists call these filled pauses, which\nare a kind of hesitation phenomenon. And these seemingly \ninsignificant interruptions are actually quite meaningful \nin spoken communication. For example, while a silent pause\nmight be interpreted as a sign for others to start speaking, a filled pause can signal\nthat you’re not finished yet. Hesitation phenomena can buy time for your\nspeech to catch up with your thoughts, or to fish out the right word \nfor a situation. And they don’t just benefit the speaker— a filled pause lets your listeners know\nan important word is on the way. Linguists have even found \nthat people are more likely to remember a word \nif it comes after a hesitation. Hesitation phenomena \naren’t the only parts of speech that take on new meaning during dialogue. Words and phrases such as “like,” \n“well” or “you know” function as discourse markers, ignoring their literal meaning to convey \nsomething about the sentence in which they appear. Discourse markers direct \nthe flow of conversation, and some studies suggest \nthat conscientious speakers use more of these phrases to ensure \neveryone is being heard and understood. For example, starting a sentence \nwith “Look...” can indicate your attitude and help \nyou gauge the listener’s agreement. “I mean” can signal that you’re about\nto elaborate on something. And the dreaded “like” \ncan perform many functions, such as establishing a loose\nconnection between thoughts, or introducing someone else's\nwords or actions. These markers give people a real-time\nview into your thought process and help listeners follow, interpret, \nand predict what you’re trying to say. Discourse markers and hesitation phenomena aren’t just useful \nfor understanding language— they help us learn it too. In 2011, a study showed toddlers \ncommon and uncommon objects alongside a recording referring \nto one of the items. When a later recording asked them \nto identify the uncommon object, toddlers performed better if that \ninstruction contained a filled pause. This may mean that filled pauses \ncue toddlers to expect novel words, and help them connect new words\nto new objects. For adolescents and adults \nlearning a second language, filled pauses smooth out awkward \nearly conversations. And once they’re more confident, the second-language learner can signal\ntheir newfound fluency by using the appropriate \nhesitation phenomenon. Because, contrary to popular belief, the use of filled pauses doesn't decrease\nwith mastery of a language. Just because hesitation phenomena\nand discourse markers are a natural part of communication \ndoesn’t mean they’re always appropriate. Outside of writing dialogue, they serve \nno purpose in most formal writing. And in some contexts, the stigma\nthese social cues carry can work against the speaker. But in most conversations, \nthese seemingly senseless sounds can convey a world of meaning. "

        "text": "Have you ever been gazing at a starry sky when suddenly \na bright dot glided into view? If it wasn't blinking, then you've had\nthe distinct pleasure of seeing one of mankind's greatest \ncollaborative feats with your own eyes: The International Space Station. Roughly the size of six-bedroom house,\nand weighing more than 320 cars, the International Space Station \nis so large that no single rocket could have \nlifted it into orbit. Instead, it was assembled piece by piece while hurtling through space\nat 28,000 kilometers per hour, lapping the Earth once every 90 minutes. It all started when sixteen nations signed the Space Station \nIntergovernmental Agreement, laying out each partner's \nexpected contributions to the ISS, from modules and maintenance\nto sharing information and finances. At an estimated 100 billion U.S. dollars, the Space Station would be\nthe most expensive object ever built. The whole world watched as a Russian rocket launched \nthe first module of the ISS into the sky. Zarya, meaning sunrise, \nwas equipped with two solar panels and a propulsion system \nthat had the important task of keeping the young station \nfrom crashing into the Earth by staying a safe 400 kilometers away. The U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour\nfollowed two weeks later carrying Unity, a node module to which\nother modules could be connected, and an international \nsix-person assembly crew. Then came Zvezda, which brought\ncommunications and living accommodations. Ever since the International \nSpace Station's first tenants arrived, it's been continually occupied with more than 200 visitors spending \nan average of six months on board. Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti \nholds the record for the longest single space flight\nby a woman at 199 days on the ISS. 2001 saw the arrival of Destiny,\nthe first of four research modules, where astronauts spend\napproximately 36 hours a week conducting extraordinary experiments\nin microgravity. Their schedules are packed with exercise, two hours a day to fend off \nmuscle atrophy, station maintenance and repair, and connecting with family \nor awe-inspired minds around the world. But they still find time for fun,\nwith regular movie nights and even shooting \nthe first music video in space. Destiny also controls the seven-jointed\nrobotic Canadarm2. Capable of moving \nmore than 100,000 kilograms, it's perfect for unloading \nnew arrivals from shuttles. 2001 was a busy year for the Space Station\nwith the addition of Quest, the main airlock for strolls outside, and Pirs, a pier for Russian \nspacecrafts to dock including the ever-ready \nemergency escape vehicle, Soyuz. Then, on February 1st, 2003, after delivering \nresearch modules to the ISS, the space shuttle\nColumbia exploded during reentry tragically killing \nthe seven-member crew on board. After a four-year hiatus, work quickly\npicked up pace with the addition of more hubs, \nairlocks, docks, and an observation cupola for stunning\n360-degree views of our world and beyond. Other critical components included \nplatforms and trusses to support radiators that direct all the heat generated\nby the station's electronics into space and solar panels that are efficient enough\nto power 55 homes. It took ten years and over 30 missions, but finally, the International \nSpace Station was complete, coinciding with the U.S. Space \nShuttle Program's retirement. The Space Station continues to serve\nas an incredible model for international collaboration. This year, two people \nbegan a one-year stay on the ISS, allowing scientists to study the long-term\nphysical and psychological effects of being in space, which would prove useful for increasingly\nambitious space travel, like trips to Mars. Over its lifetime, we've learned \nan immense amount scientifically, but also about \nour capacity to work together and accomplish truly remarkable acts. "

        "text": "The Trojan War has been raging \nfor 10 years, with neither Greeks nor Trojans \nprevailing. Gods and humans alike\nare desperate for a break, so when a divine omen races\nacross the sky, the two sides agree to a 10 day truce. From high up on Olympus you’ve been \nwaiting for an opportunity to bring this bloody war \nto its conclusion. When you go to consult the Fates,\nthey advise: should the peace last for a full 10 days,\nall will end soon. However, if the truce is broken, the ensuing battle will lead to 10 more\ndevastating years of war. The Fates’ loom has shown them \nthe exact conditions that will keep the truce intact. The great Trojan plain can be viewed \nas a grid of Greek and Trojan encampments. If they’re organized in such a way that \nany Greek can reach any other Greek camp without having to pass through a Trojan \ncamp, and likewise for Trojans, plus neither side completely surrounds \nthe other, peace will prevail. Anyone can move to a horizontally\nor vertically adjacent camp, but never diagonally. The problem is,\nthey’re currently arranged like this. Tonight, you can use your powers to swap\nup to six pairs of camps that are horizontally, vertically,\nor diagonally adjacent. No camp can be moved more than once. Which swaps do you make\nto keep the peace? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first insight here is to divide\nthis into two sub-problems. There’s the matter of connecting \n4 clumps of Greeks without putting holes in the Trojan line. And then there’s dealing \nwith the thorny center space. Let’s consider the Greeks first. To connect any Greek clumps, you’ll have to mess \nwith the nice, straight Trojan lines. If you try to do that anywhere\nin the center of these arms, you'll create new isolated\nclusters of Trojans. So the only option is to go \nto the perimeter of the field and move some Trojans diagonally,\nsay here, here, and here. Now for the center. there’s no way to connect the Trojan arms \nwithout swapping a Trojan in. But continuing to shift that arm \nof Trojans inward would require moving \nthe same Greek camp multiple times. However, you could shift the whole\nTrojan arm up and to the right, closing this gap. There are several\nsolutions with slight variants, but as long as you perform this maneuver\non the short arm of Trojans, you can achieve peace in exactly 6 moves. You make the swaps and all is well \nuntil the fifth night. One of your rival gods wants\nto see the bloodshed continue, and has taken advantage \nof a forgotten prophecy. He’s convinced one Trojan camp \nto make a swap with their horizontal, vertical, \nor diagonal Greek neighbors that will break up the Greek connectivity. Once again, you consult the Fates,\nwho prophesize the following: the meddling Trojan camp is somewhere\nwithin four grid spaces of the perimeter of the battlefield. They won’t go through with a swap \nif it only breaks up Trojan connectivity. And finally, you can make \nat most two swaps with the same rules as before \nto thwart them. Which swaps do you make \nto block the troublesome Trojan camp? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You won't be able to identify\nthe scheming camp precisely, but there’s a lot you can do \nto at least narrow down the options. They have to be somewhere in this area. And they have to be able to block Greek\ncamps from each other in a single swap. That doesn’t leave many options; the only possible blockages \nare at the end of these two arms, where a Trojan camp could plug a hole\nwithout opening a new one. So they must be in one of these \nfour camps. Let’s look at the right arm first. There’s a threat here because this column \nhas two Trojan camps. If one moves to the right, \nthe other will still be in place, blocking Greeks from crossing. so we can thwart them by moving either one\na column left into this square. and the same principle applies \nto the bottom arm. Your effort maintains the peace \nfor the final 5 days. But it seems that a certain Greek general\nnoticed what was happening and left the Trojans a parting gift... "

        "text": "There's a job out there with a great\ndeal of power, pay, prestige, and near-perfect job security. And there's only one way to be hired: get appointed to the US Supreme Court. If you want to become \na justice on the Supreme Court, the highest federal court \nin the United States, three things have to happen. You have to be nominated by\nthe president of the United States, your nomination needs to be\napproved by the Senate, and finally, the president must\nformally appoint you to the court. Because the Constitution doesn't specify\nany qualifications, in other words, that there's no age,\neducation, profession, or even native-born \ncitizenship requirement, a president can nominate any individual\nto serve. So far, six justices \nhave been foreign-born, at least one never graduated\nfrom high school, and another was only 32 years old\nwhen he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals\nwho broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint \nliberals to the court. Of course, a justice's leanings\nare not always so predictable. For example, when President Eisenhower,\na Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him\nto make conservative decisions. Instead, Warren's judgements have gone\ndown as some of the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later remarked on that\nappointment as \"the biggest damned-fool mistake\" \nhe ever made. Many other factors come up\nfor consideration, as well, including experience, personal loyalties,\nethnicity, and gender. The candidates are then thoroughly vetted down to their tax records\nand payments to domestic help. Once the president interviews \nthe candidate and makes a formal nomination\nannouncement, the Senate leadership traditionally\nturns the nomination over to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Depending on the contentiousness\nof the choice, that can stretch over many days. Since the Nixon administration,\nthese hearings have averaged 60 days. The nominee is interviewed \nabout their law record, if applicable, and where they stand on key issues\nto discern how they might vote. And especially in more recent history, the committee tries to unearth\nany dark secrets or past indiscretions. The Judiciary Committee votes to send\nthe nomination to the full Senate with a positive \nor negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings,\nor no recommendation at all. Most rejections have happened\nwhen the Senate majority has been a different political \nparty than the president. When the Senate does approve,\nit's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues \na written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete\nthe final steps to take the constitutional \nand judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer \njustice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor\nand the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge\nand perform all the duties incumbent upon a US Supreme Court justice. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement,\nor removal from the court by impeachment. And of the 112 justices who have held\nthe position, not one has yet been removed from\noffice as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect\nthe fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. With the tremendous impact\nof this responsibility, it's no wonder that a US Supreme \nCourt justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R. Kaufman, \"a paragon of virtue, an intellectual Titan, and an administrative wizard.\" Of course, not every member of the Court\nturns out to be an exemplar of justice. Each leaves behind a legacy\nof decisions and opinions to be debated and dissected\nby the ultimate judges, time and history. "

        "text": "A mirror that shatters without warning. A trail of cracker crumbs \nstrewn across the floor. Two tiny handprints that appear on a cake. Everyone at 124 Bluestone Road\nknows their house is haunted— but there’s no mystery about \nthe spirit tormenting them. This ghost is the product \nof an unspeakable trauma; the legacy of a barbaric history that hangs over much more \nthan this lone homestead. So begins \"Beloved,\" Toni Morrison’s \nPulitzer Prize-winning novel about the suffering wrought by slavery\nand the wounds that persist in its wake. Published in 1987, \"Beloved\" \ntells the story of Sethe, a woman who escaped enslavement. When the novel opens, Sethe \nhas been living free for over a decade. Her family has largely dissolved—\nSethe’s mother-in-law died years earlier, and her two sons ran away \nfrom fear of the specter. Sethe’s daughter Denver remains \nin the house, but the pair live a half-life. Shunned by the wider community, the two have only each other \nand the ghost for company. Sethe is consumed by thoughts\nof the spirit, whom she believes to be \nher eldest daughter. When a visitor from Sethe’s old life\nreturns and threatens the ghost away, it seems like the start of a new beginning\nfor her family. But what comes in the ghost’s place\nmay be even harder to bear. As with much of Morrison’s work, \"Beloved\" investigates the roles of trauma\nand love in African-American history. Morrison writes about black identities\nin a variety of contexts, but her characters are united \nby their desire to find love and be loved— even when it’s painful. Some of her novels explore when love\nchallenges social conventions, like the forbidden affection that grows\nbetween the townsfolk of \"Paradise\" and their fugitive neighbors. Other works examine how we can be\nblind to the love we already possess. In \"Sula,\" one character realizes \nthat it’s not her marriage, but rather, one of her friendships \nthat embodies the great love of her life. Perhaps Morrison’s most famous\nexploration of the difficulty of love takes place in \"Beloved.\" Here, the author considers how \nthe human spirit is diminished when you know the things and people\nyou love most will be taken away. Morrison shows that slavery \nis destructive to love in all forms, poisoning both enslaved people\nand their enslavers. \"Beloved\" examines the dehumanizing\neffects of the slave trade in numerous ways. Some are straightforward, \nsuch as referring to enslaved people as animals with monetary value. But others are more subtle. Sethe and Paul D.—\nthe visitor from her old plantation— are described as trying \nto “live an unlivable life.” Their coping mechanisms are different;\nSethe remains mired in her past, while Paul D. dissociates\nhimself completely. But in both cases, it’s clear each\ncharacter has been irreparably scarred. Morrison also blends \nperspectives and timelines, to convey how the trauma of slavery ripples across various characters\nand time periods. As she delves into the psyche \nof townspeople, enslavers, and previously enslaved people, she exposes conflicting\nviewpoints on reality. This tension shows the limitations\nof our own perspectives, and the ways in which some characters are actively avoiding the reality\nof their actions. But in other instances, the characters’\nshifting memories align perfectly; capturing the collective trauma\nthat haunts the story. Though \"Beloved\" touches on dark subjects, the book is also filled \nwith beautiful prose, highlighting its characters’ capacity\nfor love and vulnerability. In a stream-of-consciousness sequence\nwritten from Sethe’s perspective, Morrison unspools memories of subjugation\nalongside moments of tenderness; like a baby reaching for her mother’s\nearrings, spring colors, and freshly painted stairs. Sethe’s mother-in-law had them\npainted white, she recalls, “so you could see your way to the top… \nwhere lamplight didn’t reach.\" Throughout the book, Morrison asks\nus to consider hope in the dark, and to question what freedom really means. She urges readers to ponder\nthe power we have over each other, and to use that power wisely. In this way, \"Beloved\" remains a testimony\nto the destructiveness of hate, the redeeming power of love, and the responsibility we bear\nto heed the voices of the past. "

        "text": "A male firefly glows above a field \non a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond\nwith her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species \nmimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with \nher promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified \nthree defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory \nfirefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly \nadjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples \nof animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the \noctopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces \non which they rest. Other animals use mimicry \nto protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved \nred, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous \neastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings \nthese markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like\nfemale wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit \nby having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited \nto their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate \nthe reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors\nto match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their \nenvironments more closely when they see a bird predator \nrather than a snake– birds, after all, \nhave better color vision. One of the more fascinating \nexamples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees \nin the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators \nand calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, \nand others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound \na false alarm when those other species \nhave captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down \nto steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos \nwith much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members \nof their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body \nvulnerable to attack. But it’s still driven to protect \nits home against rivals. So it has become a masterful bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually \nmore likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses \nto strike or stab its opponents. And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep \ntheir homes than non-bluffers. In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t \nwithstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed \nthat its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely\nto bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely \nto be driven away. It would seem that instead of just \nthreatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the \nsituation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think \nwe'll never be able to answer it. We can't observe animals’ \ninternal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what an animal \nis thinking in order to detect deception. By watching behavior and its outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate \npredators, prey, and rivals, and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex. "

        "text": "Your mortal enemy has captured you\nand hooked you up to a bizarre experiment. He’s extended your nervous system \nwith one very long neuron to a target about 70 meters away. At some point, \nhe’s going to fire an arrow. If you can then think a thought \nto the target before the arrow hits it, he’ll let you go. So who wins that race? In order to answer, we have to examine\nthe hardware of thought: neurons. The human brain has about 86 billion \nof these cells. They transmit signals down their axons \nby way of electrical impulses, or action potentials. One neuron can then pass that signal \nto the next at a synapse by way of chemical neurotransmitters. The signal is received \nby the next neuron’s dendrites, propagated down its axon,\nand passed further along. So, the key factors that determine \nhow quickly you think include how long it takes to generate \nan initial action potential; propagate it down the length of the axon;\nand transport it through the synapse. We must also factor in the number \nof neurons involved and the distance the signal has to travel. Let’s see what this looks like in a simple\npathway— your knee-jerk reflex. A strike to your patellar tendon \ntriggers an electrical impulse that travels up a sensory neuron \nto your spine. There the signal branches, \nand for the sake of simplicity, we’ll consider the segment that jumps\ninto a motor neuron to journey back down your leg. The total length of the neurons \nin that pathway is about 1 meter in someone \nwho is 5 foot 5 inches, and on average it takes \n15 to 30 milliseconds from strike to kick. Speed is distance divided by time, so this signal travels somewhere \nbetween 120 to 240 kilometers per hour. The initial action potential accounts \nfor 1 to 5 milliseconds and synaptic transmissions only take \n.1 to .5 milliseconds, so the bulk of that time\nis spent within the axons. This is consistent with research findings that the average individual neuron sends\nsignals at around 180 kilometers per hour. But speeds can be boosted with myelination\nand increased axon diameter. Myelin is a fatty sheath \nthat insulates an axon, preventing electrical currents\nfrom leaking out. Meanwhile, axons with larger diameters\noffer less internal resistance. These compounded factors can raise\nthe speed of an action potential as high as 432 kilometers per hour. There’s plenty of variation: \nsome people think faster than others, and your own speed of thought changes\nthroughout your lifetime. In particular, as you reach old age, the myelin sheath covering your axons\nwears down, and other neuronal structures degrade. Back to the dastardly experiment. Arrows shot from recurve bows fly,\non average, around 240 kilometers per hour. Which means that given a sufficiently\nlong, myelinated or large-diameter neuron, your thoughts actually could win the race. But… there’s a wrinkle. The arrow and thought don’t leave \nthe gate at the same time; first the arrow fires, \nthen once you perceive it, your signal can start down its path. Processing images or music, \nparticipating in inner speech, and recalling memories all require\ncomplicated neural pathways that are nowhere close to the linearity\nof the knee-jerk reflex. The speed at which these thoughts\noccur is mostly consistent, with variations based on myelination\nand axon diameter. But the duration of a thought will vary\nsignificantly depending on its routes, pitstops, and destination. In this case, when you perceive\na threatening stimulus, you’ll invoke a fear startle response. Similar to the knee-jerk response, a startle can be involuntary \nand quite fast. If the string twangs loud enough, you might react \nin less than 65 milliseconds. More likely though, your startle reaction\nwill be based on sight. Our eyes can process an image \nas quickly as 13 milliseconds, but computation of what you’re seeing\nand determining the danger it poses can take as long \nas 180 to 200 milliseconds. In that time the arrow will have gained\na head start of about 13 meters. The target is far enough away that you’ve got just enough \nof a chance to catch up, if you can quickly, and quite literally,\nthink your way out. "

        "text": "Flanked by two powerful European nations,\nthe English Channel has long been one of the world’s \nmost important maritime passages. Yet for most of its history, the channel’s rocky shores \nand stormy weather made crossing a dangerous prospect. Engineers of the early 1800's \nproposed numerous plans for spanning the 33 kilometer gap. Their designs included artificial islands \nlinked by bridges, submerged tubes suspended \nfrom floating platforms, and an underwater passage more than twice \nthe length of any existing tunnel. By the end of the century, this last proposal had captured \nEuropean imagination. The invention \nof the tunnel boring machine and the discovery of a stable layer \nof chalk marl below the seabed made this fantastic tunnel \nmore feasible. But the project’s most urgent obstacles \nwere ones no engineer could solve. At the time, Britons viewed their geographic isolation \nas a strategic advantage, and fears about French invasion \nshut down plans for the tunnel. The rise of aerial warfare rendered \nthese worries obsolete, but new economic concerns \narose to replace them. Finally, 100 years after \nthe initial excavation, the two countries \nreached an agreement— the tunnel would proceed \nwith private funding. In 1985, a group \nof French and British companies invested the modern equivalent \nof 14 billion pounds, making the tunnel the most expensive \ninfrastructure project to date. The design called \nfor three separate tunnels— one for trains to France, \none for trains to England, and one service tunnel between them. Alongside crossover chambers, \nemergency passages, and air ducts, this amounted to over 200 kilometers \nof tunnels. In 1988, workers began excavating \nfrom both sides, planning to meet in the middle. Early surveys of the French coast \nrevealed the site was full of fault lines. These small cracks \nlet water seep into the rock, so engineers had to develop \nwaterproof boring machines. The British anticipated drier conditions, \nand forged ahead with regular borers. But only months into the work, water \nflooded in through undetected fissures. To drill in this wet chalk, \nthe British had to use grout to seal the cracks \ncreated in the borer’s wake, and even work ahead of the main borer to reinforce the chalk \nabout to be drilled. With these obstacles behind them, \nboth teams began drilling at full speed. Boring machines weighing up to 1,300 tons \ndrilled at nearly 3.5 meters per hour. As they dug, they installed lining rings \nto stabilize the tunnel behind them, making way for support wagons \nfollowing each machine. Even at top speed, \nwork had to proceed carefully. The chalk layer followed a winding path \nbetween unstable rock and clay, punctured by over 100 boring holes \nmade by previous surveyors. Furthermore, both teams had \nto constantly check their coordinates to ensure they were on track to meet \nwithin 2 centimeters of each other. To maintain this delicate trajectory, the borers employed \nsatellite positioning systems, as well as paleontologists \nwho used excavated fossils to confirm they were at the right depth. During construction, \nthe project employed over 13,000 people and cost the lives of ten workers. But after two and a half years \nof tunneling, the two sides finally made contact. British worker Graham Fagg \nemerged on the French side, becoming the first human to cross \nthe channel by land since the Ice Age. There was still work to be done— from installing crossover chambers \nand pumping stations, to laying over a hundred miles of tracks, \ncables, and sensors. But on May 6, 1994, an opening ceremony \nmarked the tunnel’s completion. Full public service began \n16 months later, with trains for passengers \nand rail shuttles for cars and trucks. Today, the Channel Tunnel services \nover 20 million passengers a year, transporting riders across the channel \nin just 35 minutes. Unfortunately, not everyone has \nthe privilege of making this trip legally. Thousands of refugees have tried \nto enter Britain through the tunnel in sometimes fatal attempts. These tragedies have transformed \nthe tunnel’s southern entrance into an ongoing site of conflict. Hopefully, the structure’s history \ncan serve as a reminder that humanity is at their best \nwhen breaking down barriers. "

        "text": "Oh the humanity! Ah... humanity... It’s a trainwreck,\nbut I can’t look away. It’s 1843, and a debate is raging \namong physicians about one of the most common \nkillers of women: childbed fever. Childbed fever strikes \nwithin days of giving birth, killing more than 70% of those infected—\nand nobody knows what causes it. Obstetrician Charles Meigs has a theory. Having observed abdominal inflammation in patients who go on \nto develop the fever, he claims this inflammation \nis the cause of childbed fever. Much of the medical establishment\nsupports his theory. Oh, come on! They really leave me no choice \nbut to teach them some skepticism. That’s better. Now, Meigs, your argument is based \non a fallacy— the false cause fallacy. Correlation does not imply causation: When two phenomena regularly occur\ntogether, one does not necessarily \ncause the other. So you say women who have inflammation\nalso come down with childbed fever, therefore the inflammation \ncaused the fever. But that’s not necessarily true. Yes, yes, the inflammation comes first,\nthen the fever, so it seems like the inflammation \ncauses the fever. But by that logic, since babies \nusually grow hair before teeth, hair growth must cause tooth growth. And we all know that’s not true,\nright? Actually, don’t answer that. A couple of different things \ncould be going on here. First, it’s possible that fever \nand inflammation are correlated purely by coincidence. Or, there could be a causal relationship\nthat’s the opposite of what you think— the fever causes the inflammation, rather than the inflammation \ncausing the fever. Or both could share a common \nunderlying cause you haven’t thought of. If I may, just what do you think \ncauses inflammation? Nothing? It just is? Really? Humor me for a moment in discussing\none of your colleague’s ideas— Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. I know, I know, \nyou don’t like his theory— you already wrote \na scathing letter about it. But let’s fill your students in, shall we? Holmes noticed a pattern: \nwhen a patient dies of childbed fever, a doctor performs an autopsy. If the doctor then treats a new patient, that patient often comes \ndown with the fever. Based on this correlation between autopsies of fever victims\nand new fever patients, he proposes a possible cause. Since there’s no evidence that the autopsy\ncauses the fever beyond this correlation, he doesn’t jump to the conclusion \nthat autopsy causes fever. Instead, he suggests that doctors \nare infecting their patients via an invisible contaminant \non their hands and surgical instruments. This idea outrages most doctors, \nwho see themselves as infallible. Like Meigs here, who refuses \nto consider the possibility that he’s playing a role \nin his patients’ plight. His flawed argument doesn’t leave any \npath forward for further investigation— but Holmes’ does. It’s 1847, and physician Ignaz Semmelweis has reduced the number \nof childbed fever deaths in a clinic from 12% to 1% \nby requiring all medical personnel to disinfect their hands after autopsies\nand between patient examinations. With this initiative, he has proven\nthe contagious nature of childbed fever. Ha! It’s 1879, and Louis Pasteur \nhas identified the contaminant responsible \nfor many cases of childbed fever: Hemolytic streptococcus bacteria. Hmm, my fries are cold. Must be because my ice cream melted. "

        "text": "Muhammad Ali spent years training\nto become the greatest boxer the world had ever seen, but only moments to create\nthe shortest poem. Ali captivated Harvard's \ngraduating class in 1975 with his message of unity and friendship. When he finished, \nthe audience wanted more. They wanted a poem. Ali delivered what is considered\nthe shortest poem ever. \"Me, we.\" Or is it \"me, weeee\"? No one's really sure. Regardless, if these two words are a poem,\nthen what exactly makes a poem a poem? Poets themselves have struggled\nwith this question, often using metaphors to approximate\na definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? Poetry generally has certain\nrecognizable characteristics. One - poems emphasize language's\nmusical qualities. This can be achieved through\nrhyme, rhythm, and meter, from the sonnets of Shakepeare, to the odes of Confucius, to the Sanskrit Vedas. Two - poems use condensed language, like literature with all the water\nwrung out of it. Three - poems often feature\nintense feelings, from Rumi's spiritual poetry to Pablo Neruda's \"Ode to an Onion.\" Poetry, like art itself, has a way\nof challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns \nof the earliest poems were a way to remember stories\neven before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's \"silencio\" toe the line between visual art\nand poetry. Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems\nwhose shapes were as important as the words themselves, in this case amplifying the sad loneliness\nof a single leaf falling through space. If the visual nature of poetry\nfaded into the background, perhaps we'd be left with music, and that's an area that people\nlove to debate. Are songs poems? Many don't regard songwriters as poets\nin a literary sense, but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, and Tupac Shakur often hold up even without the music. In rap, poet elements like rhyme,\nrhythm, and imagery are inseparable from the form. Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G. \"I can hear sweat trickling \ndown your cheek Your heartbeat sound \nlike Sasquatch feet Thundering, shaking the concrete.\" So far, all the examples we've seen\nhave had line breaks. We can even imagine the two words\nof Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape \nthat we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate\nthe rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images\nand wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form\nand more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like\nMartin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted\nupdates from the earthquake in Haiti. \"Was in b-room getting dressed\nwhen heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing.\" Smith uses language in a way\nthat is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form \nthat emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five, \nseven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry, \nprose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began\nin verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis,\nwhich means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with\nthe raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human\nin a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea\nby asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted \nthrough stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those\nmade by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while\nscientists have successfully used artificial intelligence \nin manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed\n100% of the time. "

        "text": "This may look like a neatly arranged\nstack of numbers, but it's actually\na mathematical treasure trove. Indian mathematicians called it \nthe Staircase of Mount Meru. In Iran, it's the Khayyam Triangle. And in China, it's Yang Hui's Triangle. To much of the Western world,\nit's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, which seems a bit unfair\nsince he was clearly late to the party, but he still had a lot to contribute. So what is it about this that has so \nintrigued mathematicians the world over? In short, \nit's full of patterns and secrets. First and foremost, there's the pattern\nthat generates it. Start with one and imagine invisible\nzeros on either side of it. Add them together in pairs, \nand you'll generate the next row. Now, do that again and again. Keep going and you'll wind up \nwith something like this, though really Pascal's Triangle \ngoes on infinitely. Now, each row corresponds to what's called\nthe coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form (x+y)^n, where n is the number of the row, and we start counting from zero. So if you make n=2 and expand it, you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2). The coefficients, \nor numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row\nof Pascal's Triangle. You'll see the same thing with n=3,\nwhich expands to this. So the triangle is a quick and easy way\nto look up all of these coefficients. But there's much more. For example, add up \nthe numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two. Or in a given row, treat each number\nas part of a decimal expansion. In other words, row two is\n(1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100). You get 121, which is 11^2. And take a look at what happens\nwhen you do the same thing to row six. It adds up to 1,771,561,\nwhich is 11^6, and so on. There are also geometric applications. Look at the diagonals. The first two aren't very interesting:\nall ones, and then the positive integers, also known as natural numbers. But the numbers in the next diagonal\nare called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dots, you can stack them \ninto equilateral triangles. The next diagonal \nhas the tetrahedral numbers because similarly, you can stack\nthat many spheres into tetrahedra. Or how about this:\nshade in all of the odd numbers. It doesn't look like much\nwhen the triangle's small, but if you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal \nknown as Sierpinski's Triangle. This triangle isn't just \na mathematical work of art. It's also quite useful, especially when it comes \nto probability and calculations in the domain of combinatorics. Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family \nof three girls and two boys. In the binomial expansion, that corresponds \nto girl plus boy to the fifth power. So we look at the row five, where the first number \ncorresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys. The third number \nis what we're looking for. Ten out of the sum \nof all the possibilities in the row. so 10/32, or 31.25%. Or, if you're randomly \npicking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups \nof five are there? In combinatoric terms, this problem would\nbe phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth \nelement of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer. The patterns in Pascal's Triangle are a testament to the elegantly \ninterwoven fabric of mathematics. And it's still revealing fresh secrets\nto this day. For example, mathematicians recently \ndiscovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomials. What might we find next? Well, that's up to you. "

        "text": "As Numberland’s best detective,\nyou thought you’d seen it all. But the desiccated corpses \nof prominent natural numbers— whole numbers greater than 0— have been showing up all over the city\nfor the past week. All of Digitopolis is on lockdown\nfrom sundown to sunrise, and it’s still not enough to stop\nwhat can only be described as a vampiric feeding frenzy. The police are helpless, \nand have turned to you. You put the missing persons case \nyou’ve been investigating on hold and study the evidence. Here’s what you know: most victims have been completely\ndrained of their life’s essence. Some have a thin line of slime\nseparating digits— some of which were drained \nand others spared. Which leads you to mystery one: what’s the significance \nof the slime-lines, and why are certain digits untouched? Pause here to figure it out yourself. \nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s start by looking \nfor a pattern in the victims. Why have some been fully drained,\nand some slimed? Well, the slime-lined are in their prime— which is to say they’re prime numbers,\ndivisible only by 1 and themselves. Not a single one of the unslimed numbers,\non the other hand, is. Furthermore, the drained parts of the \nslimed primes are not, themselves, prime. When 71 got slimed, 7 was prime,\nbut 1 was not. If 461 had been split into 4 and 61,\nthe right side would have been prime, but instead it was split further\ninto non-prime digits. And when 2099 got slimed, \nthe attacker went with 20 and 99, and was able to drain both. So you have a big problem. There are infinite potential victims: all non-prime numbers, and all prime numbers that can \nbe slime-lined to reveal at least one non-prime number. In fact, you can only think of a few\nnumbers that aren't vulnerable. First of all, the one digit primes: \n2, 3, 5, and 7. Then primes like 23, which could only be\nsplit into 2 and 3, both prime. These numbers are familiar, but why? Aha! Your missing person’s case. Someone is kidnapping the numbers\nthat can’t be drained: we’ll call them the immune. If you can identify the four immune \nwho remain, perhaps you can get to them first\nand figure out what’s going on. Who are the immune?\nPause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are 4 one-digit immune:\n2, 3, 5, and 7. All have already been kidnapped. But every digit in all of the immune\nmust be one of those four numbers; otherwise there would be \na non-prime split possible. That means there are only these 16\ncandidates among the two-digit numbers. The ones that are prime must be immune. We can eliminate anything \nthat ends in 2 or 5, as they’ll always be divisible by 2 and 5. This diagonal is also out,\nas they’re divisible by 11. If the digits of a number add\nup to a multiple of 3, it’s divisible by 3. So that eliminates 57 and 27,\nleaving these numbers. Which, upon double-checking, are, \nin fact, immune. We now have a strong starting point\nfor searching three-digit numbers: any 2 consecutive digits must be \non the list of the two-digit immune. Those all end in 3 and 7, so the only possibilities\nare these 8 options: the two-digit immune with additional\n3s or 7s on their ends. 3 can’t follow 3,\nnor 7 follow 7. And once again, adding the digits \nreveals that 237 and 537 are divisible by 3. 737 is 67 times 11, \nso that leaves just 373, which is, in fact, prime,\nand therefore immune. Could a four-digit number be immune? No, any consecutive three digits\nwould have to be immune, and there’s no immune three digit\nnumber that starts with a 7. You rush out, \nbut reach each home too late, until the only immune left is 373. You’re in the nick of time to scare\noff her would-be kidnapper; not the vampire itself but a minion. 373 explains that she and the other immune\nare the subjects of an ancient prophecy that designated them as vampire slayers. They’d sometimes gather and try \nto figure out what a vampire is, but no one had the slightest idea. They found the idea of slaying\nthings quite distasteful. You both trail her would-be kidnapper\nback to a foreboding castle. There you release the other \nkidnapped numbers and confront the vampire himself. He’s powerless before the slayers, \nbut ever the pacifists, they round him up, return the lifeforce \nto his victims, and send him packing. Numberland is safe... for now. "

The yin, the dark swirl, is associated with shadows, femininity, and the trough of a wave; the yang, the light swirl, represents brightness, passion and growth. John Bellaimey explains why we all contain the spirit of yin and of yang -- and how we can achieve a balance of both in our lives.\n\nLesson by John Bellaimey, animation by TED-Ed.",

        "text": "You might have seen this symbol before, whether it's as a temporary tattoo or at a Chinese temple. It's called the yin-yang symbol. It comes from Taoism, a religion born in China and it has far more meaning than you probably realize. The yin is the dark swirl, and the yang is the light one, and each side has a dot of the opposite color, which gives a clue to the meaning of yin and yang. Everything contains the seed of its opposite. Darth Vadar has the seed of goodness, and Luke has the potential to follow his father to the dark side. Like Luke and his father, yin and yang are not total opposites, they are relative to each other. Taoists believe that the universe is made up of energies, vibrations, and matter, which behave differently in different contexts. Something can be yin or yang depending on, well, depending on lots of things. So, while wheat that's growing is yang, when it's being reaped, it's yin. A wave's crest is yang, and the trough is yin. Villages on the sunny side of a valley in China have names like Liuyang or Shiyang, but on the shady side, for example, of the Yangtze River Valley, there's Jiangyin. The brake is yin to the gas pedal's yang. An eggshell is yang, the egg inside is yin. You think you're getting it? Yang is harder, stronger, brighter, and faster, but one can turn into the other or are two sides of the same coin. The sunbeams are yang in comparison to the shadows. The pitch is yang, the catch is yin. The yang starts an action, and the yin receives it, completes it. Yin is the inside space of a cup; it wouldn't be a cup without it. Yang is the cup. The coffee's heat, however, is yang, and its blackness is yin. Yang goes berserk sometimes, but there's some very powerful yins, too, if they don't quite go berserk. Yin is the darker swirl, the female, but there is a white dot in it. And yang is the lighter, the male, but it has a black dot. Water flowing calmly in a river is yin, but when it goes over the waterfall, it's very yang. Toothpicks are yin compared with a telephone pole. The back of a person is more yang than the front. The top of a person is the yang end. Taoism teaches that there is a power in the universe. It's higher, deeper, and truer than any other force. They call it the Tao. It means the way. Like the Force in Star Wars, the Tao has two sides. Unlike other religions where the higher power is all good, and perhaps has an all-evil rival, Taoism teaches that we need to learn from both yin and yang. And unlike religions with gods that are personal, the higher power in Taoism is not. Taoists believe that living in harmony with the way, a person will not have to fight against the universe's natural flow. So, for example, listen more, argue less. Be ready to back up or undo something, and you will make even faster progress. Don't worry about being the best, be who you are. Live simply. Complications take you away from the Tao. \"The wise person is flexible,\" Taoists say. Learning to use the Tao is what Taoism is all about, and that's why you should know your yin from your yang. "

        "text": "Have you ever walked into a grocery store and wondered where all those variety\nof apples came from? You might find SnapDragon, Pixie Crunch, Cosmic Crisp, Jazz, or Ambrosia next to the more familiar\nRed Delicious and Granny Smith. These delightfully descriptive names belong to just a handful of the over\n7,500 apple varieties in the world. This huge diversity exists largely because\nof humanity's efforts to bear new fruit. Fruit breeding is a way to fulfill\nthe expectations of farmers and consumers who seek specific qualities in an apple. On the one hand, farmers may want them\nto be disease-resistant and to store well. On the other, consumers are swayed\nby appearance, taste, and novelty. So, breeders have to consider everything from how well apples grow\nin certain climates to their color, taste, and size. And sometimes finding the perfect\nfit means breeding something new. To create apples \nwith desirable characteristics, breeders first need to find parent\napples that carry those characteristics. Once the parents have been selected, they have to wait until the trees\nbloom in the spring. The breeder takes the pollen\nfrom one bloom, called the father, and transfers it by hand to the other\nparent bloom, called the mother, through a process \ncalled cross-pollination. Once the mother bloom \nturns into an apple, the seeds are collected and then planted. It takes about five years for these seeds\nto grow into trees that produce apples, but because of the way \ntraits are inherited, all of the seedlings produced will have\ndifferent sets of genes and characteristics. This means that to achieve \na desired quality, it takes a lot of offspring, not to mention patience \non the breeder's part. When a seedling does bear fruit\nwith the desired qualities, it's selected for further evaluation. Of the original crossed seedlings, about one in every 5,000 makes it\nto this prestigious stage. They're then sent to new farms where breeders can assess how various\nclimates and soil types affect the plant's growth. The fruit of the seedling \nand its many clones must then be collected and sampled\nto ensure consistency. Breeders study about 45 traits\nin an apple, like the texture \nand firmness of the flesh, when it ripens, how sugary its juice is, and how long it stays fresh. Over several years, they weed out\nall the bad apples, selecting only those \nwhose fruits are the best. These exclusive plants \nofficially form the cultivar, or new apple variety. To ensure an exact copy of this cultivar, all apple trees must be grafted \nfrom the original seedling. Branches, called scion wood, are cut from the original tree \nand grown to generate more scion wood. Segments of these trees are then grafted\nonto root stalk - that's the lower section of another tree that's been chosen \nfrom a different cultivar for its superior roots \nand growing ability. Finally, this fusion creates \na new apple tree with the desired qualities. Each new plant takes up to four years before it starts producing \nthe fruit we eat. Apple breeding may be a difficult art,\nbut it's accessible to all: universities, companies, and even individuals can create\nnew cultivars. But to fully own an apple, the breeder\nfaces a final challenge - naming the fruit. After a cultivar is patented, a breeder chooses a name\nfor its trademark. That final step grants them long-lasting\nrights over the apple and its clones. That name must be completely original, and the catchier, the better, of course. With over 7,500 varieties and counting, that's why we have apples called\nPink Lady, Sweet Tango, Kiku, and EverCrisp. The more we work with nature's bounty\nto breed new cultivars, the more creative and delectable\nthese names will become. "

They buried chests in the desert sand,\nhid them in caves, and sealed them in secret rooms. Inside these chests was a treasure \nmore valuable than gold: the city’s ancient books. Founded around 1100 CE \nin what is now Mali, the city of Timbuktu started \nout as an unremarkable trading post. But its unique location \nsoon changed that. Timbuktu marked the intersection\nof two essential trade routes, where caravans bringing \nsalt across the Sahara met with traders bringing gold\nfrom the African interior. By the late 1300s, these trade routes \nmade Timbuktu rich, and the city’s rulers, \nthe kings of the Mali Empire, built monuments and academies\nthat drew scholars from Egypt, Spain, and Morocco. The city’s prime location also made\nit a target for warlords and conquerors. As the Mali Empire declined, \none of its domains, Songhai, began to gain power. In 1468, the Songhai king \nconquered Timbuktu, burning buildings and murdering scholars. But in time, intellectual life \nin the city flourished again. The reign of the second king \nof the Songhai Empire, Askia Mohammed Toure, marked the beginning of a golden age \nin Timbuktu. He reversed his predecessor’s\nregressive policies and encouraged learning. The Songhai rulers and most of Timbuktu’s \npopulation were Muslim, and the scholars of Timbuktu \nstudied Islam alongside secular topics \nlike mathematics and philosophy. In the libraries of Timbuktu, tracts of Greek philosophy stood\nalongside the writings of local historians, scientists,\nand poets. The city’s most prominent scholar,\nAhmed Baba, challenged prevailing opinions\non subjects ranging from smoking to slavery. Gold and salt trade had funded\nthe city’s transformation into a center of learning. Now, the products \nof that intellectual culture became the most sought-after \ncommodity. With paper from faraway Venice and vibrant ink from local plants\nand minerals, the scribes of Timbuktu produced \ntexts in both Arabic and local languages. Written in calligraphy and decorated\nwith intricate geometric designs, the books of Timbuktu were in demand\namong the wealthiest members of society. In 1591, the golden age \ncame to an abrupt end when the Moroccan king \ncaptured Timbuktu. Moroccan forces imprisoned \nAhmed Baba and other prominent scholars and confiscated their libraries. In the centuries that followed, the city \nweathered a succession of conquests. In the mid-1800s, \nSufi Jihadists occupied Timbuktu and destroyed many non-religious\nmanuscripts. 1894, French colonial forces seized\ncontrol of the city, stealing even more manuscripts\nand sending them to Europe. French became the official language\ntaught in schools, and new generations in Timbuktu couldn’t read the Arabic manuscripts \nthat remained. Through it all, the literary tradition\nof Timbuktu didn’t die— it went underground. Some families built secret libraries\nin their homes, or buried the books in their gardens. Others stashed them in abandoned caves \nor holes in the desert. The priceless manuscripts of Timbuktu dispersed to villages \nthroughout the surrounding area, where regular citizens guarded \nthem for hundreds of years. As desertification and war \nimpoverished the region, families held on to the ancient books even as they faced desperate poverty\nand near-starvation. Even today, the struggle to protect\nthe books continues. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, Timbuktu scholar Abdel Kader Haidara\npainstakingly retrieved hidden manuscripts from all over northern Mali \nand brought them back to Timbuktu. But in 2012, civil war in Mali \nonce again threatened the manuscripts, most of which were evacuated\nto nearby Bamako. Their future remains uncertain, as they face both human \nand environmental threats. These books represent our best—\nand often only— sources on the pre-colonial history\nof the region. Many of them have never been \nread by modern scholars, and still more remain lost \nor hidden in the desert. At stake in the efforts to protect\nthem is the history they contain— and the efforts of countless generations\nto protect that history from being lost. "

The first life form wouldn’t have had \nother organisms to consume, of course, so it must have been an autotroph, generating energy either from the sun\nor from chemical gradients. So what locations meet these criteria? Places on land or close to the surface \nof the ocean have the advantage of access to sunlight. But at the time when life began,\nthe UV radiation on Earth’s surface was likely too harsh for life \nto survive there. One setting offers protection \nfrom this radiation and an alternative energy source: the hydrothermal vents that wind across\nthe ocean floor, covered by kilometers of seawater \nand bathed in complete darkness. A hydrothermal vent is a fissure \nin the Earth’s crust where seawater seeps into magma \nchambers and is ejected back out \nat high temperatures, along with a rich slurry of minerals \nand simple chemical compounds. Energy is particularly concentrated at the steep chemical gradients \nof hydrothermal vents. There’s another line of evidence \nthat points to hydrothermal vents: the Last Universal Common Ancestor \nof life, or LUCA for short. LUCA wasn’t the first life form, \nbut it’s as far back as we can trace. Even so, we don’t actually know what \nLUCA looked like— there’s no LUCA fossil, no modern-day \nLUCA still around— instead, scientists identified genes that\nare commonly found in species across all three domains \nof life that exist today. Since these genes are shared across \nspecies and domains, they must have been inherited from \na common ancestor. These shared genes tell us that LUCA lived\nin a hot, oxygen-free place and harvested energy from a chemical \ngradient— like the ones at hydrothermal vents. There are two kinds of hydrothermal vent: black smokers and white smokers. Black smokers release acidic, \ncarbon-dioxide-rich water, heated to hundreds of degrees Celsius\nand packed with sulphur, iron, copper, and other metals essential to life. But scientists now believe that black \nsmokers were too hot for LUCA— so now the top candidates for the \ncradle of life are white smokers. Among the white smokers, a field of hydrothermal vents on the \nMid-Atlantic Ridge called Lost City has become the most favored candidate \nfor the cradle of life. The seawater expelled here is highly \nalkaline and lacks carbon dioxide, but is rich in methane and offers \nmore hospitable temperatures. Adjacent black smokers may have \ncontributed the carbon dioxide necessary for life to evolve at Lost City, giving it all the components to support \nthe first organisms that radiated into the incredible \ndiversity of life on Earth today.

        "text": "Hunger claws at your grumbling belly. It tugs at your intestines, \nwhich begin to writhe, aching to be fed. Being hungry generates a powerful,\noften unpleasant physical sensation that's almost impossible to ignore. After you've reacted by gorging\non your morning pancakes, you start to experience \nan opposing force, fullness, but how does your body actually know\nwhen you're full? The sensation of fullness is set in motion\nas food moves from your mouth down your esophagus. Once it hits your stomach,\nit gradually fills the space. That causes the surrounding\nmuscular wall to stretch, expanding slowly like a balloon. A multitude of nerves wrapped\nintricately around the stomach wall sense the stretching. They communicate with the vagus nerve\nup to the brainstem and hypothalamus, the main parts of the brain\nthat control food intake. But that's just one input your brain uses\nto sense fullness. After all, if you fill \nyour stomach with water, you won't feel full for long. Your brain also takes into account\nchemical messengers in the form of hormones produced\nby endocrine cells throughout your digestive system. These respond to the presence of specific\nnutrients in your gut and bloodstream, which gradually increase \nas you digest your food. As the hormones seep out, \nthey're swept up by the blood and eventually reach the hypothalamus\nin the brain. Over 20 gastrointestinal hormones \nare involved in moderating our appetites. One example is cholecystokinin, which is produced in response to food\nby cells in the upper small bowel. When it reached the hypothalamus, it causes a reduction in the feeling\nof reward you get when you eat food. When that occurs, the sense\nof being satiated starts to sink in and you stop eating. Cholecystokinin also slows down\nthe movement of food from the stomach into the intestines. That makes your stomach stretch\nmore over a period of time, allowing your body to register\nthat you're filling up. This seems to be why when you eat slowly,\nyou actually feel fuller compared to when you consume your food\nat lightning speed. When you eat quickly, your body doesn't\nhave time to recognize the state it's in. Once nutrients and gastrointestinal\nhormones are present in the blood, they trigger the pancreas\nto release insulin. Insulin stimulates the body's fat cells\nto make another hormone called leptin. Leptin reacts with receptors\non neuron populations in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus has two sets of neurons\nimportant for our feeling of hunger. One set produces the sensation of hunger\nby making and releasing certain proteins. The other set inhibits hunger through\nits own set of compounds. Leptin inhibits the hypothalamus neurons\nthat drive food intake and stimulates the neurons \nthat suppress it. By this point, your body has reached\npeak fullness. Through the constant exchange \nof information between hormones, the vagus nerve, the brainstem, and the different portions \nof hypothalamus, your brain gets the signal\nthat you've eaten enough. Researchers have discovered that some foods produce \nmore long-lasting fullness than others. For instance, boiled potatoes are ranked as some of the most \nhunger-satisfying foods, while croissants \nare particularly unsatisfying. In general, foods with more protein,\nfiber, and water tend to keep hunger at bay for longer. But feeling full won't last forever. After a few hours, your gut and brain\nbegin their conversation again. Your empty stomach produces\nother hormones, such as ghrelin, that increase the activity of \nthe hunger-causing nerve cells in the hypothalamus. Eventually, the growling beast of hunger\nis reawakened. Luckily, there's a dependable \nantidote for that. "

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar These days scientists know how you inherit characteristics\nfrom your parents. They're able to calculate probabilities\nof having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease according to the information\nfrom the parents and the family history. But how is this possible? To understand how traits pass\nfrom one living being to its descendants, we need to go back in time\nto the 19th century and a man named Gregor Mendel. Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants. By breeding the pea plants\nhe was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles\nthat rule heredity. In one of most classic examples, Mendel combined\na purebred yellow-seeded plant with a purebred green-seeded plant, and he got only yellow seeds. He called the yellow-colored trait\nthe dominant one, because it was expressed\nin all the new seeds. Then he let the new yellow-seeded\nhybrid plants self-fertilize. And in this second generation,\nhe got both yellow and green seeds, which meant the green trait\nhad been hidden by the dominant yellow. He called this hidden trait\nthe recessive trait. From those results, Mendel inferred that each trait depends\non a pair of factors, one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father. Now we know that these factors\nare called alleles and represent the different\nvariations of a gene. Depending on which type of allele\nMendel found in each seed, we can have what we call a homozygous pea,\nwhere both alleles are identical, and what we call a heterozygous pea, when the two alleles are different. This combination of alleles\nis known as genotype and its result, being yellow or green, is called phenotype. To clearly visualize how alleles\nare distributed amongst descendants, we can a diagram\ncalled the Punnett square. You place the different\nalleles on both axes and then figure out\nthe possible combinations. Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example. Let's write the dominant yellow allele\nas an uppercase \"Y\" and the recessive green allele\nas a lowercase \"y.\" The uppercase Y always\noverpowers his lowercase friend, so the only time you get green babies is if you have lowercase Y's. In Mendel's first generation,\nthe yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid\na yellow-dominant allele, and the green homozygous pea dad\nwill give a green-recessive allele. So all the pea kids\nwill be yellow heterozygous. Then, in the second generation, where the two heterozygous kids marry, their babies could have\nany of the three possible genotypes, showing the two possible phenotypes in a three-to-one proportion. But even peas have\na lot of characteristics. For example, besides\nbeing yellow or green, peas may be round or wrinkled. So we could have all\nthese possible combinations: round yellow peas, round green peas, wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled green peas. To calculate the proportions\nfor each genotype and phenotype, we can use a Punnett square too. Of course, this will make it\na little more complex. And lots of things are more\ncomplicated than peas, like, say, people. These days, scientists know a lot more\nabout genetics and heredity. And there are many other ways in which\nsome characteristics are inherited. But, it all started\nwith Mendel and his peas. "

        "text": "Deep underground lies stores of once\ninaccessible natural gas. This gas was likely formed \nover millions of years as layers of decaying organisms\nwere exposed to intense heat and pressure under the Earth's crust. There's a technology called\nhydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that can extract this natural gas, potentially powering us\nfor decades to come. So how does fracking work, and why it is a source \nof such heated controversy? A fracking site can be anywhere\nwith natural gas, from a remote desert to several hundred feet\nfrom your backyard. It starts out with a long vertical hole\nknown as a wellbore drilled down through layers of sediment. When the well reaches 2500 - 3000 meters,\nit's at its kickoff point where it can begin the process\nof horizontal drilling. It turns 90 degrees and extends\nhorizontally for about 1.5 kilometers through a compressed black layer\ncalled the shale rock formation. A specialized perforating gun\nis then lowered and fired, creating a series of small, \ninch-long holes that burst through the well's casing\ninto the rock layer. About three to four months\nafter the initial drilling, the well is ready for fracking to begin. Fracking fluid is pumped down\ninto the well at a pressure so high, it cracks the shale rock, creating fractures through which\nthe trapped gas and oil can escape. The fluid itself is more than 90% water. The rest is made up of concentrated\nchemical additives. These vary depending on the specific\ncharacteristics of the fracking site, but usually fall into three categories: acids for clearing debris\nand dissolving minerals, friction-reducing compounds to create a slippery form of water \nknown as slickwater, and disinfectant to prevent\nbacteria growth. Sand or clay is also mixed into\nthe water to prop open the fissures so the gas and oil can keep leaking out,\neven after the pressure is released. It's estimated that all of fracking's\nintense pumping and flushing uses an average of 3-6 million gallons\nof water per well. That's actually not a lot compared\nto agriculture, power plants, or even golf course maintenance, but it can have a notable impact\non local water supply. And disposing of used fracking water\nis also an issue. Along with the trapped gas\nthat's pumped up to the surface, millions of gallons of flow-back liquid\ncome gushing up. This liquid containing contaminants\nlike radioactive material, salts, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons, needs to be stored and disposed of. That's usually done in pits on-site\nin deep wells or off-site at water treatment facilities. Another option is to recycle\nthe flow-back liquid, but the recycling process can actually\nincrease levels of contamination since the water is more toxic\nwith each use. Wells are typically encased \nin steel and cement to prevent contaminants from leaking\ninto groundwater. But any negligence \nor fracking-related accidents can have devastating effects. Fracturing directly \ninto underground water hazardous underground \nseepage and leakage, and inadequate treatment and disposal\nof highly-toxic waste water can potentially contaminate\ndrinking water around a fracking site. There's also concern about\nthe threat of earthquakes and damaged infrastructure from pressure \nand waste water injection. Links between fracking\nand increased seismic activity leave unresolved questions\nabout long-term pressure imbalances that might be happening\ndeep beneath our feet. Fracking's biggest controversy, though,\nis happening above the ground. The general consensus is that burning\nnatural gas is better for the environment than burning coal since the gas collected from fracking emits only half \nthe carbon dioxide as coal per unit of energy. The pollution caused \nby the fracking itself, though, isn't negligible. Methane that leaks out during the drilling\nand pumping process is many times more potent\nthan carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Some scientists argue that methane\neventually dissipates, so has a relatively low long-term impact. But a greater question hangs in the air. Does fracking take time,\nmoney, and research away from the development\nof cleaner renewable energy sources? Natural gas is non-renewable, and the short-run economic interests\nsupporting fracking may fall short in the face\nof global climate change. Experts are still examining\nfracking's overarching effects. Although modern fracking has been\naround since the 1940s, it's boomed in the last few decades. As other sources of natural gas decrease,\nthe costs of non-renewable energies rise, and cutting-edge technologies\nmake it so accessible. But many countries and regions\nhave already banned fracking in response to environmental concerns. It's undeniable that fracking has reshaped\nthe energy landscape around the world, but for what long-term benefit\nand at what cost? "

        "text": "When Ireneo Funes looked at a glass of \nwine on a table, he saw “all the shoots, clusters, and \ngrapes of the vine. He remembered the shapes of the clouds \nin the south at the dawn of the 30th of April of 1882, and he could compare them in his \nrecollection with the marbled grain in the design of a leather-bound book \nwhich he had seen only once, and with the lines in the spray \nwhich an oar raised in the Rio Negro on the eve of the \nbattle of the Quebrancho.” In the short story “Funes, the Memorious,” Jorge Luis Borges explores what it would \nbe like to have a perfect memory. His character not only remembers \neverything he has ever seen, but every time he has seen \nit in perfect detail. These details are so overwhelming Funes has to spend his days \nin a dark room, and can only sleep by imagining a part \nof town he has never visited. According to Borges, Funes’s memories even rendered him \nincapable of real thought, because “To think is to forget a \ndifference, to generalize, to abstract. In the overly replete world of Funes \nthere were nothing but details.” Funes’ limitless memory was just one \nof Borges’s many explorations of infinity. Born in Argentina in 1899, he admired the revolutionaries \nof his mother’s family but took after his father’s bookish clan. His body of essays, poems, and stories, \nor, as he called them, ficciones pioneered the literary style of \n“lo real maravilloso,” known in English as Magical Realism— and each was just a few pages long. Though Borges was not interested in \nwriting long books, he was an avid reader, recruiting friends to read to him \nafter he went blind in middle age. He said his image of paradise was an \ninfinite library, an idea he brought to life in \n“The library of Babel.” Built out of countless identical rooms, each containing the same number of \nbooks of the same length, the library of babel is its own universe. It contains every possible \nvariation of text, so there are some profound books, but also countless tomes \nof complete gibberish. The narrator has spent his entire life wandering this vast labyrinth \nof information in a possibly futile search for meaning. Labyrinths appeared over and over \nin Borges’ work. In “The Garden of Forking Paths,” as Yu Tsun winds his way through \ncountry roads, he remembers a lost labyrinth \nbuilt by one of his ancestors. Over the course of the story, he finds out the labyrinth is not a \nphysical maze but a novel. And this novel reveals that the real \nGarden of Forking Paths is time: in every instant, there are infinite \npossible courses of action. And as one moment follows another, each possibility begets another \nset of divergent futures. Borges laid out infinite expanses of time\nin his labyrinths, but he also explored the idea of \ncondensing all of time into a single moment. In “The God’s Script,” at the very beginning of the world the god writes exactly one message into the spots of the jaguars, who then “love and reproduce without end, in caverns, in cane fields, on islands, in order that the last men \nmight receive it.” The last man turns out to be a tenacious\nold priest who spends years memorizing and \ndeciphering the jaguar’s spots, culminating in an epiphany where he \nfinally understands the god’s message. Imprisoned deep underground, he has no one to share this meaning with, and it changes nothing \nabout his circumstances, but he doesn’t mind: in that one moment, he has experienced all the experience of\neveryone who has ever existed. Reading Borges, you might catch\na glimpse of infinity too. "

Actually, it’s impossible to make a map\nof the world 100% right. No, not you, globe—\nwe know you’re accurate. Not you, Google Earth,\nyou’re just a digital globe. We're talking about flat maps, which,\nlet's face it, are way more convenient\nfor a lot of things. Anyway, as we were saying, it’s impossible to make a 100% accurate\nflat map of a spherical planet. For a long time, people didn't even try. They just plonked places down in arbitrary\nlocations without any consistent scale. Then in 150 AD, the Greek mathematician\nand astronomer Ptolemy systematically mapped the Earth on a grid and placed locations on the grid\naccording to coordinates, so maps could be checked against\nothers and replicated. Ptolemy built his grid out of lines\nwe still use today: 180 lines of latitude\nand 360 lines of longitude. In spite of these advances,\npeople kept getting lost. Part of the problem was a— shall we say— incomplete understanding\nof the world’s geography. But it was also just really difficult\nto navigate using a map. Because the Earth is round, the shortest route from one place\nto another is a path along a circle. If we draw this route on a flat map, it passes through every line of longitude\nat a different angle. To follow the route,\nyou’d have to constantly shift the direction you're traveling. Any slight error would land\nyou in the wrong place. In 1569, Gerardus Mercator\nfixed this problem. He created a world map proportioned so these curved navigational routes\nwould be straight, passing through every line\nof longitude at the same angle and therefore allowing navigators\nto set a constant bearing— in other words, travel in one direction—\nfor a whole journey. There was just one tiny hitch: to do this, he had to distort land masses\nand bodies of water so those furthest\nfrom the equator got larger and those closest\nto the equator shrank. In spite of its inaccuracies, Mercator’s\nmap was very useful. In fact, it’s still widely used today,\nincluding in online maps. But it’s still wrong! In 1925, the Goode Homolosine Projection\nwas created as— get this— an interrupted pseudo-cylindrical\nequal area projection. What does that mean?\nNot important. The point was to minimize\ndistortion for the entire world. The map can be land-oriented...\nor ocean-oriented. Either way, the so-called orange peel map\nisn’t very easy to read. The Dymaxion Projection by American\narchitect Buckminster Fuller in the 1940s is even better. Sorry,\ndid we say better? It’s not better if you want to understand\nwhere things are in the world. It is better in the sense that there are\nno visibly evident distortions of the land masses. Though if you wanted to know, say,\nhow far Brazil is from Nigeria, you won’t get any sense\nof that from this map. The most accurate projection to date\nis the AuthaGraph World Map designed by Japanese architect\nHajime Narukawa in 1999. The continents and oceans are almost\ncompletely in proportion, and the map is rectangular,\njust how we like it. Could this be the perfect map? Well... no. Since the Mercator works\nfor navigation and reads clearly, why bother with all these\nwhacky maps? Arno Peters argued that by enlarging\nEuropean and North American countries, the Mercator projection\ngives white nations a sense of supremacy over non-white nations\ncloser to the equator. He adapted the Gall-Peters Projection,\nwhich counteracts that particular problem, but the continents are still... stretched. Today, we rely on maps less and less\nfor navigation, but they still play a vital role\nin education. Peters was definitely on to something: no matter what map we’re looking at, it’s a story told from the perspective\nof the map’s creator that in turn shapes—perhaps unduly—\nour perception of our world. Simple changes in map design, even changes that have nothing\nto do with how we transfer a round Earth to a flat surface,\ncan completely shift our point of view. "

        "text": "As the sun sets on a plantation\nin Jamaica, children flock to Mr. Kwaku for a story. They all know he’s full of tales \nfrom Ghana, the land of their ancestors. But what they don’t know, Kwaku winks, is how their ancestors got those stories\nin the first place. Long ago, all stories belonged to Nyame,\nthe all-seeing Sky God. People on Earth were bored \nand knew nothing about their history. But one creature decided\nenough was enough. Anansi, the tricky, shapeshifting spider, resolved to bring the stories\ndown to Earth. He spun a web that stretched \ninto the clouds and climbed up to confront the Sky God. Crouching at Nyame’s feet,\nAnansi shouted at the top of his lungs that he had come to take ownership \nof the world’s stories. Looking down from his golden stool, Nyame hooted with laughter \nat the spider’s absurd request. Nyame told Anansi that he could have\nall the stories he wished— but only if he could complete\nan impossible task. If Anansi brought him \nOsebo the Leopard, Onini the Python, Mmoboro the Hornet, \nand Mmoatia the Forest Spirit, then he could take the stories. Anansi humbly accepted. Nyame didn’t see him grinning \nas he scuttled away. Back on Earth, Anansi grabbed \nhis magic bag and set to work. Anansi found Onini the Python\nbathing in the sun. Anansi scoffed that Onini \ncouldn’t be the longest animal, saying he looked no longer \nthan a piece of bamboo cane. Enraged, Onini stretched himself across\nthe bamboo to prove his lengthiness. Anansi quickly bound him tight-tight \nto each end and placed him in his bag. Next, Anansi dug a great pit \nin the middle of the path Osebo the Leopard usually prowled,\nand covered it with banana leaves. Sure enough, mighty Osebo soon fell in. Anansi scolded Osebo for his carelessness,\nbut offered to rescue him. As he helped Osebo out of the pit,\nAnansi swiftly jabbed him with his knife. Osebo fell back to the ground where Anansi wound him up\ntight-tight in spider thread. Then, Anansi heard Mmoboro \nand his hornets buzzing. He cautiously approached them. This would be tricky— their stings \ncould make someone swell up and die— but Anansi knew they hated rain. He filled his mouth with water \nand spat it at the swarm. As they panicked, Anansi urged the hornets\nto shelter in his gourd, where they found themselves trapped. Anansi had one more task:\nto capture Mmoatia the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit. She usually hid herself deep in the woods,\nbut Anansi knew she was lonely. So, he made a little doll covered in sap\nand left it in her path. When she came upon it, \nMmoatia spoke to the doll but became enraged when it didn’t answer. She hit the disrespectful doll and her small fists stuck \nto its sticky surface. Anansi wrapped Mmoatia up tight-tight \nand scooped her into his bag along with the other creatures. Triumphantly, he climbed his web\nback into the clouds. When the Sky God saw that Anansi \nhad completed the impossible task, he was amazed. Nyame told Anansi \nthat he had earned the world’s stories. Dancing for joy, Anansi gathered them up,\nstuffed the stories into his bag, and descended to Earth. There, he scattered the stories \nthroughout the world for people to share. And they did, Kwaku tells the children. Generations have continued\ntelling and reimagining Anansi’s stories even after being stolen from Africa\nand enslaved. Anansi may be small, but “cunning’s\nbetter than strong,” Kwaku says, and tells the children to take Anansi’s \nstories with them wherever they go. Looking at his audience, Kwaku knows\nthat Anansi will persist as a symbol of resourcefulness \nand resistance in the face of oppression, and a testament to the enduring power\nof storytelling. "

        "text": "This pencil-eraser-sized mass of cells \nis something called a brain organoid. It’s a collection of lab-grown neurons \nand other brain tissue that scientists can use to\nlearn about full-grown human brains. And it can be grown from \na sample of your skin cells. Why would we need such a thing? Neuroscientists face a challenge: shielded by our thick skulls and\nswaddled in layers of protective tissue, the human brain is\nextremely difficult to observe in action. For centuries, scientists have tried to\nunderstand them using autopsies, animal models, and, in recent years, imaging techniques. We’ve learned a lot through \nall these methods, but they have limitations. Conditions like Alzheimer’s \nand schizophrenia, and the effect on\nthe human brain of diseases like Zika, continue to hide beyond our view,\nand our understanding. Enter brain organoids, \nwhich function like human brains but aren’t part of an organism. Each one comes from \nan undifferentiated stem cell, which is a cell that\ncan develop into any tissue in the body, from bone to brain. Scientists can make undifferentiated \nstem cells from skin cells. That means they can take a skin sample \nfrom a person with a particular condition and generate brain organoids\nfrom that person. The hardest part of growing \na brain organoid, which stumped scientists for years, was finding the perfect combination of\nsugars, proteins, vitamins, and minerals that would induce the stem cell \nto develop a neural identity. That was only discovered recently, \nin 2013. The rest of the process \nis surprisingly easy. A neural stem cell essentially \ngrows itself, similar to how a seed grows into a plant, all it needs are the brain’s equivalents \nof soil, water, and sunlight. A special gel to simulate \nembryonic tissue, a warm incubator set at body temperature, and a bit of motion to mimic blood flow. The stem cell grows into \na very small version of an early-developing human brain, complete with neurons that can connect\nto one another and make simplified neural networks. As mini brains grow, they follow \nall the steps of fetal brain development. By observing this process, \nwe can learn how our neurons develop, as well as how we end up with \nso many more of them in our cortex, the part responsible for higher cognition\nlike logic and reasoning, than other species. Being able to grow brains in the lab,\neven tiny ones, raises ethical questions, like: Can they think for themselves, \nor develop consciousness? And the answer is no, for several reasons. A brain organoid has the same tissue types\nas a full-sized brain, but isn’t organized the same way. The organoid is similar to an airplane that’s been taken apart \nand reassembled at random; you could still study the wings, \nthe engine, and other parts, but the plane could never fly. Similarly, a brain organoid allows us \nto study different types of brain tissue, but can’t think. And even if mini brains were organized \nlike a real brain, they still wouldn’t be able \nto reason or develop consciousness. A big part of what makes our brains so\nsmart is their size, and mini brains have only \nabout 100,000 neurons compared to the 86 billion \nin a full-sized brain. Scientists aren’t likely to grow larger \nbrain organoids anytime soon. Without blood vessels to feed them, their size is limited \nto one centimeter at most. Finally, mini brains aren’t able \nto interact with the outside world. We learn by interacting \nwith our environments: receiving inputs through our eyes, ears, and other \nsensory organs, and reacting in turn. The complex neural networks that underlie \nconscious thoughts and actions develop from this feedback loop. Without it, the organoids \ncan never form a functional network. There’s nothing quite like \nthe actual human brain, but mini brains are an unprecedented tool for studying everything \nfrom development to disease. With luck, these humble \norganoids can help us discover what makes the human brain unique, and maybe bring us closer \nto answering the age-old question: what makes us human? "

        "text": "In the savannahs of Kenya, two female \nnorthern white rhinos, Nájin and Fatu, munch contentedly on the grass. At the time of this video’s publication, these are the last two known \nnorthern white rhinos left on Earth. Their species is functionally extinct— without a male, \nNájin and Fatu can’t reproduce. And yet, there’s still hope to revive \nthe northern white rhino. How can that be? The story starts about 50 years ago, when poachers began illegally hunting \nthousands of rhinos across Africa for their horns. This, combined with civil wars \nin their territory, decimated northern white rhino \npopulations. Concerned conservationists began trying \nto breed them in captivity in the 1970s, collecting and storing semen from males. Only four rhinos were ultimately born \nthrough the ambitious breeding program. Nájin, and her daughter Fatu \nwere the last two. In 2014, conservationists discovered \nthat neither can have a calf. Though Nájin gave birth to Fatu, \nshe now has weak hindlegs, which could harm her health \nif she became pregnant again. Fatu, meanwhile, \nhas a degenerated uterine lining. Then, the last northern white rhino male \nof the species, Sudan, died in 2018. But there was one glimmer of hope: \nartificial reproduction. With no living males and no females \nable to carry a pregnancy, this is a complicated and risky process \nto say the least. Though scientists had stored semen, \nthey would have to collect the eggs— a complex procedure that requires a female\nto be sedated for up to two hours. Then, they’d create a viable embryo \nin the lab— something that had never been done before,\nand no one knew how to do. Even that was just the beginning— a surrogate mother \nof another rhino species would have to carry the embryo to term. Females of a closely related species, \nthe southern white rhino, became both the key to developing \na rhino embryo in a lab and the leading candidates \nfor surrogate mothers. Northern and southern white rhinos \ndiverged about a million of years ago into separate— though still \nclosely-related— species. They inhabit different regions, and have \nslightly different physical traits. In a fortunate coincidence, \nseveral female southern white rhinos needed treatment \nfor their own reproductive problems, and researchers could collect eggs \nas part of that treatment. In Dvůr Králové Zoo in October 2015, experts of IZW Berlin began collecting \neggs from southern white rhinos and sending them to Avantea, an animal \nreproduction laboratory in Italy. There, scientists developed and perfected \na technique to create a viable embryo. Once they mastered the technique, researchers extracted Nájin and Fatu’s \neggs on August 22, 2019 and flew them to Italy. Three days later, they fertilized \nthe eggs with sperm from a northern white rhino male. After another week, two of the eggs \nmade it to the stage of development when the embryo can be frozen \nand preserved for future. Another collection in December 2019 \nproduced one more embryo. As of early 2020, the plan is to collect \nNájin and Fatu’s eggs three times a year if they’re healthy enough. In the meantime, \nresearchers are looking for promising southern white rhino \nsurrogate mothers— ideally who’ve carried a pregnancy \nto term before. The surrogacy plan \nis somewhat of a leap of faith— southern and northern white rhinos \nhave interbred both during the last glacial period \nand more recently in 1977, so researchers are optimistic \na southern white rhino would be able to carry \na northern white rhino to term. Also, the two species’ pregnancies \nare the same length. Still, transferring an embryo \nto a rhino is tricky because of the shape of the cervix. The ultimate goal, \nwhich will take decades, is to establish a breeding population \nof northern white rhinos in their original range. Studies suggest that we have samples \nfrom enough individuals to recreate a population with the genetic \ndiversity the species had a century ago. Though the specifics \nof this effort are unique, as more species face critical endangerment\nor functional extinction, it’s also an arena for big questions: do we have a responsibility to try \nto bring species back from the brink, especially when human actions \nbrought them there in the first place? Are there limits to the effort \nwe should expend on saving animals threatened \nwith extinction? "

        "text": "In 1958, Rachel Carson received a letter describing songbirds suddenly dropping \nfrom tree branches. The writer blamed their deaths \non a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had sprayed \non a nearby marsh. The letter was the push \nCarson needed to investigate DDT. She had already heard from scientists \nand conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the pesticide \nposed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make inquiries \nthrough government contacts from her years working \nin the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She asked: “what has already silenced \nthe voices of spring?” In 1962, Carson published her findings \nin \"Silent Spring.\" Her book documented \nthe misuse of chemicals and their toll on nature \nand human health. \"Silent Spring\" immediately drew both \napplause and impassioned dissent— along with vicious personal attacks \non the author. How did this mild-mannered biologist \nand writer ignite such controversy? Carson began her career \nas a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology \nat John Hopkins University with part time jobs. Still, she had to leave school \nbefore completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father \nand sister. Carson found part time work \nwith the Bureau of Fisheries writing for a radio program \non marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could \nhold the general public’s attention impressed her superiors, \nand in 1936, she became the second woman \nto be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published \nthe first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations\non underwater worlds. These explorations resonated \nwith a wide audience. In \"Silent Spring,\" \nCarson turned her attention to the ways human actions \nthreaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally used during \nWorld War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers \nfrom insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed \nin wide swaths to fight pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants \nin the southern U.S. killed wildlife indiscriminately,\nbut did little to eliminate the ants. In spite of this and other mishaps, \nthe US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies \nextolled the benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public \nawareness about its potential harm. But Carson showed how \nthe overuse of chemicals led to the evolution \nof resistant species— which, in turn, encouraged the development\nof deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time \nit would accumulate in the environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues \nof animals who consume those insects, and eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT \nmight alter the structure of genes, with unknown consequences \nfor future generations. The response to \"Silent Spring\" \nwas explosive. For many people the book \nwas a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson \nhadn’t mentioned DDT’s role controlling the threat insects \nposed to human health. Former Secretary of Agriculture \nEzra Taft Benson demanded to know “why a spinster with no children \nwas so concerned about genetics?” and dismissed Carson \nas “probably a Communist.” A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer \nalluded to Carson and her supporters as “sinister influences” \naiming to paint businesses as “immoral.” In reality, Carson had focused \non the dangers of chemicals because they weren’t widely understood, \nwhile the merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief \nthat humans should and could control nature. Instead, she challenged people \nto cultivate “maturity and mastery, not of nature, \nbut of ourselves.” Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after \nthe publication of \"Silent Spring.\" Her work galvanized a generation \nof environmental activists. In 1969, under pressure \nfrom environmentalists, Congress passed \nthe National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate\nenvironmental impacts of their actions. To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. And in 1972, the EPA issued \na partial ban on the use of DDT. Long after her death, Rachel Carson \ncontinued to advocate for nature through the lingering impact \nof her writing. "

        "text": "In 1984, two field workers discovered \na body in a bog outside Cheshire, England. Officials named the body the Lindow Man and determined that he’d suffered \nserious injuries, including blunt trauma and strangulation. But the most shocking thing \nabout this gruesome story was that they were able to determine these\ndetails from a body over 2,000 years old. Typically, decomposition would make\nsuch injuries hard to detect on a body buried just weeks earlier. So why was this corpse \nso perfectly preserved? And why don't all bodies\nstay in this condition? The answers to these questions\nlive six feet underground. It may not appear very lively down here, but a single teaspoon of soil \ncontains more organisms than there are human beings on the planet. From bacteria and algae \nto fungi and protozoa, soils are home to one quarter of Earth’s\nbiodiversity. And perhaps the soil’s most important \ninhabitants are microbes, organisms no larger \nthan several hundred nanometers that decompose all the planet’s \ndead and dying organic material. Imagine we drop an apple in the forest. As soon as it contacts the soil, worms and other invertebrates begin\nbreaking it down into smaller parts; absorbing nutrients from what they consume\nand excreting the rest. This first stage of decomposition\nsets the scene for microbes. The specific microbes present\ndepend on the environment. For example, in grasslands and farm fields\nthere tend to be more bacteria, which excel at breaking down \ngrass and leaves. But in this temperate forest \nthere are more fungi, capable of breaking down \ncomplex woody materials. Looking to harvest more food\nfrom the apple’s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction\ncalled oxidation. This breaks down the molecules \nof organic matter, releasing energy, carbon, and other nutrients \nin a process called mineralization. Then microbes consume the carbon\nand some nutrients, while excess molecules of nitrogen, \nsulfur, calcium, and more are left behind in the soil. As insects and worms eat\nmore of the apple, they expose more surface area \nfor these microbial enzymes to oxidize and mineralize. Even the excretions they leave behind\nare mined by microbes. This continues until the apple\nis reduced to nothing— a process that would take one to two\nmonths in a temperate forest. Environments that are hot and wet \nsupport more microbes than places that are cold and dry, allowing them to decompose things\nmore quickly. And less complex organic materials \nbreak down faster. But given enough time, all organic matter is reduced \nto microscopic mineral nutrients. The atomic bonds between these molecules\nare too strong to break down any further. So instead, \nthese nutrients feed plant life, which grow more food that will\neventually decompose. This constant cycle of creating and \ndecomposing supports all life on Earth. But there are a few environments too\nhostile for these multi-talented microbes— including the peat bogs \noutside Cheshire, England. Peat bogs are mostly made of highly\nacidic Sphagnum mosses. These plants acidify the soil\nwhile also releasing a compound that binds to nitrogen, \ndepriving the area of nutrients. Alongside cold \nnorthern European temperatures, these conditions make it impossible \nfor most microbes to function. With nothing to break them down, the dead mosses pile up, \npreventing oxygen from entering the bog. The result is a naturally sealed system. Whatever organic matter enters a peat bog\njust sits there— like the Lindow Man. The acid of the bog was strong enough to dissolve relatively simple material \nlike bone, and it turned more complex tissue \nlike skin and organs pitch black. But his corpse is otherwise \nso well-preserved, that we can determine \nhe was healthy, mid-20s, and potentially wealthy \nas his body shows few signs of hard labor. We even know the Lindow Man’s last meal— a still undigested piece of charred bread. Scholars are less certain about \nthe circumstances of his death. While cold-blooded murder\nis a possibility, the extremity of his injuries\nsuggest a ritual sacrifice. Even 2,000 years ago, there’s evidence the bog was known \nfor its almost supernatural qualities; a place where the soil beneath your feet \nwasn’t quite dead or alive. "

Through careful observation and imitation,\nshe soon became a skilled weaver. The sun god, Kinich Ahau, \nwas impressed with her work, and admired her from afar. But the goddess’ grandfather\nwas very possessive and would not let the sun god \nanywhere near his beloved granddaughter. To get past the grandfather,\nthe sun god disguised himself as a hummingbird. As he took a drink \nof tobacco flower honey, the moon goddess spotted him \nand asked her grandfather to capture the bird for her. The grandfather shot the disguised sun god\nwith a blow dart, stunning him. Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird \nback to health, and soon, he was able to spread his wings\nand fly again. He transformed back into the sun god\nand invited the moon goddess to escape with him. The two rowed away in a canoe, but the grandfather called \nupon the powerful storm god to help him stop them. Sensing danger, the moon goddess jumped\nfrom the canoe into the water below and transformed into a crab. But the storm god had already\nthrown a lightning bolt, which hit the crab and pierced her\nthrough her heart, killing her. Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies\ngathered, buzzing songs and fluttering \ntheir transparent wings. They formed a thick, magical cloud \nover the moon goddess’ body. For thirteen days the dragonflies cut, \ncleaned, and hollowed thirteen logs. On the thirteenth night, \nthe logs burst open, and the moon goddess emerged—\nalive and more brilliant than ever. The sun god wasted no time\nin proposing marriage. The moon goddess happily agreed. Side-by-side, they were ready to light \nup the sky with their powerful rays. Unfortunately, the story \ndoesn’t end there. The sun god’s brother visited often. Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel, \nthe sun god grew jealous, and began to mistreat her. One day, Ix Chel was sitting \non the riverbank, furious at her husband. A huge bird came gliding down and offered to take her\nto the high mountain peaks. To get away from the cruel sun god,\nshe agreed. There, she met the king of the vultures. The vulture king was kind and fun-loving— a much better partner\nthan the violent sun god. The moon goddess made a new home\nwith him in the mountains. When the sun god heard, he was distraught. He hid inside a deer carcass\nuntil a hungry vulture came swooping down, then hopped onto its back \nand rode to the mountain kingdom where the moon goddess now lived\nwith the vulture king. He begged her to come home with him,\napologizing for how he had treated her. The kind and forgiving goddess \ntook pity on him and agreed to go back. But Kinich Ahau soon began \nto show his true nature again. He struck her, scarring her face\nand dimming her bright rays. Ix Chel flew off into the dark. From then on, she vowed \nto appear only at night. She befriended the stars, and combined\nher pale blue rays with their light to guide night travelers to safety. She used her healing gift, which she had once used \non the wounded sun god, to cure people who were ill. Today, Ix Chel is so widely known that she’s become \na symbol of Maya culture. But archeological evidence suggests\nthat for the ancient Maya Ix Chel and the moon goddess \nwere separate deities. In the retellings of Maya people \nand the records of anthropologists, the two have merged \nso that Ix Chel’s story extends beyond the limits \nof the historical record. Her story, like all myths, \nisn’t just one story: the variations, ancient and modern,\nspeak to what people value, and how they see themselves \nin their mythological heroes. "

        "text": "In Islamic culture, \ngeometry is everywhere. You can find it in mosques,\nmadrasas, palaces and private homes. This tradition began in the 8th century CE\nduring the early history of Islam, when craftsmen took preexisting motifs\nfrom Roman and Persian cultures and developed them into new forms\nof visual expression. This period of history was a golden age\nof Islamic culture, during which many achievements \nof previous civilizations were preserved and further developed, resulting in fundamental advancements\nin scientific study and mathematics. Accompanying this was an increasingly\nsophisticated use of abstraction and complex geometry in Islamic art, from intricate floral motifs\nadorning carpets and textiles, to patterns of tilework that seemed\nto repeat infinitely, inspiring wonder \nand contemplation of eternal order. Despite the remarkable complexity\nof these designs, they can be created \nwith just a compass to draw circles and a ruler to make lines within them. And from these simple tools emerges \na kaleidoscope multiplicity of patterns. So how does that work? Well, everything starts with a circle. The first major decision \nis how will you divide it up? Most patterns split the circle\ninto four, five or six equal sections. And each division gives rise\nto distinctive patterns. There's an easy way to determine\nwhether any pattern is based on fourfold, fivefold, or sixfold symmetry. Most contain stars surrounded\nby petal shapes. Counting the number \nof rays on a starburst, or the number of petals around it, tells us what category \nthe pattern falls into. A star with six rays,\nor surrounded by six petals, belongs in the sixfold category. One with eight petals is part\nof the fourfold category, and so on. There's another secret ingredient\nin these designs: an underlying grid. Invisible, but essential to every pattern, the grid helps determine the scale\nof the composition before work begins, keeps the pattern accurate, and facilitates the invention \nof incredible new patterns. Let's look at an example of how these\nelements come together. We'll start with a circle within a square,\nand divide it into eight equal parts. We can then draw a pair\nof criss-crossing lines and overlay them with another two. These lines are called construction lines, and by choosing a set of their segments, we'll form the basis \nof our repeating pattern. Many different designs are possible\nfrom the same construction lines just by picking different segments. And the full pattern finally emerges when we create a grid with many\nrepetitions of this one tile in a process called tessellation. By choosing a different set \nof construction lines, we might have created this pattern, or this one. The possibilities are virtually endless. We can follow the same steps\nto create sixfold patterns by drawing construction lines\nover a circle divided into six parts, and then tessellating it,\nwe can make something like this. Here's another sixfold pattern\nthat has appeared across the centuries and all over the Islamic world, including Marrakesh, Agra, Konya\nand the Alhambra. Fourfold patterns fit in a square grid,\nand sixfold patterns in a hexagonal grid. Fivefold patterns, however,\nare more challenging to tessellate because pentagons \ndon't neatly fill a surface, so instead of just creating \na pattern in a pentagon, other shapes have to be added\nto make something that is repeatable, resulting in patterns that may seem\nconfoundingly complex, but are still relatively simple to create. Also, tessellation is not constrained\nto simple geometric shapes, as M.C. Escher's work demonstrates. And while the Islamic \ngeometric design tradition doesn't tend to employ elements \nlike fish and faces, it does sometimes make use of multiple \nshapes to craft complex patterns. This more than 1,000-year-old tradition\nhas wielded basic geometry to produce works that are intricate,\ndecorative and pleasing to the eye. And these craftsmen prove just how\nmuch is possible with some artistic intuition, creativity,\ndedication and a great compass and ruler. "

        "text": "Is teleportation possible? Could a baseball transform into\nsomething like a radio wave, travel through buildings, bounce around corners, and change back into a baseball? Oddly enough, thanks to quantum mechanics,\nthe answer might actually be yes. Sort of. Here's the trick. The baseball itself couldn't \nbe sent by radio, but all the information about it could. In quantum physics, atoms and electrons are interpreted as a collection\nof distinct properties, for example, position, momentum, and intrinsic spin. The values of these properties \nconfigure the particle, giving it a quantum state identity. If two electrons have \nthe same quantum state, they're identical. In a literal sense, our baseball\nis defined by a collective quantum state resulting from its many atoms. If this quantum state information\ncould be read in Boston and sent around the world, atoms for the same chemical elements\ncould have this information imprinted on them in Bangalore and be carefully directed to assemble, becoming the exact same baseball. There's a wrinkle though. Quantum states aren't so easy to measure. The uncertainty principle \nin quantum physics implies the position and momentum\nof a particle can't be measured at the same time. The simplest way to measure\nthe exact position of an electron requires scattering a particle of light,\na photon, from it, and collecting the light in a microscope. But that scattering changes the momentum\nof the electron in an unpredictable way. We lose all previous information\nabout momentum. In a sense, \nquantum information is fragile. Measuring the information changes it. So how can we transmit something we're not permitted to fully read\nwithout destroying it? The answer can be found in the strange\nphenomena of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is an old mystery\nfrom the early days of quantum physics and it's still not entirely understood. Entangling the spin of two electrons\nresults in an influence that transcends distance. Measuring the spin of the first electron determines what spin will \nmeasure for the second, whether the two particles are a mile\nor a light year apart. Somehow, information \nabout the first electron's quantum state, called a qubit of data, influences its partner without \ntransmission across the intervening space. Einstein and his colleagues called\nthis strange communcation spooky action at a distance. While it does seem that entanglement\nbetween two particles helps transfer a qubit instantaneously\nacross the space between them, there's a catch. This interaction must begin locally. The two electrons must be entangled\nin close proximity before one of them is transported\nto a new site. By itself, quantum entanglement\nisn't teleportation. To complete the teleport, we need a digital message to help\ninterpret the qubit at the receiving end. Two bits of data created by measuring\nthe first particle. These digital bits must be transmitted\nby a classical channel that's limited by the speed of light,\nradio, microwaves, or perhaps fiberoptics. When we measure a particle\nfor this digital message, we destroy its quantum information, which means the baseball must disappear\nfrom Boston for it to teleport to Bangalore. Thanks to the uncertainty principle, teleportation transfers the information\nabout the baseball between the two cities\nand never duplicates it. So in principle, we could teleport \nobjects, even people, but at present, it seems unlikely\nwe can measure the quantum states of the trillion trillion or more atoms\nin large objects and then recreate them elsewhere. The complexity of this task\nand the energy needed is astronomical. For now, we can reliably teleport\nsingle electrons and atoms, which may lead to super-secured\ndata encryption for future quantum computers. The philosophical implications\nof quantum teleportation are subtle. A teleported object doesn't exactly\ntransport across space like tangible matter, nor does it exactly transmit across space,\nlike intangible information. It seems to do a little of both. Quantum physics gives us \na strange new vision for all the matter in our universe\nas collections of fragile information. And quantum teleportation reveals\nnew ways to influence this fragility. And remember, never say never. In a little over a century, mankind has advanced from an uncertain \nnew understanding of the behavior of electrons\nat the atomic scale to reliably teleporting them\nacross a room. What new technical mastery \nof such phenomena might we have in 1,000, \nor even 10,000 years? Only time and space will tell. "

        "text": "If you were to lay your digestive tract\nout in a straight line, it would form a tube \nspanning nearly ten meters. The last 1.5 meters of that\nare called the colon, or large intestine. Cells in this organ's lining \nconstantly renew themselves, but the genes that moderate this process\noccasionally go awry, leading to the excessive growth \nof new cells. That results in small growths\nor abnormal clumps of cells called polyps. The majority of these polyps \nwon't do any harm, but some can become cancerous\nwhen their cells begin to grow and divide rapidly, projecting further into the colon. At that point, they can transform\ninto colon cancer, one of the most prevalent and\npreventable forms of cancer in the world. That's a slow process: though growth times vary, it often takes around ten years\nfor a small polyp to grow and develop into a cancerous one. We don't know exactly what causes the majority of colon polyps \nand colon cancers. We do know in general that colon cancer\ninvolves the activation of what's called oncogenes in the polyp, and/or the loss of tumor-suppressor genes\nthat usually keep cancer cells in check. Most cells have proto-oncogenes\nthat help them grow. When a proto-oncogene mutates,\nor there are two many copies of it, it can become a permanently \nactive oncogene with cells that grow out of control. While we don't yet know exactly what\nunderlying factors cause these changes, experts suspect a combination\nof both environmental and inherited genetic factors. In the worst cases, when cells within\npolyps divide and spread unchecked, they eventually break through\nthe lining of the colon. Lymph and blood vessels carry\nthose cells all over the body, and they can go on to form tumors. Despite these challenges,\nthere's a solution. We've become extremely good at\ndetecting and removing offending polyps before they can cause cancer. This happens through a process\ncalled screening, and when we do it regularly,\nwe can prevent many cases of colon cancer. So, who's at risk? Most cases occur in people \naged 50 years or older. This group is considered at average risk\nfor colon cancer or colon polyps. There's also a higher risk group\nthat includes people with personal or family histories \nof colon polyps or cancer, and those who suffer \nfrom inherited genetic syndromes, or inflammatory diseases, like Crohn’s disease \nand ulcerative colitis. So the best age to initiate screening\nvaries from person to person. If you have access to healthcare, it's best to consult a doctor\nto find out when you should begin. Screening can be done with various tests. Colonoscopy involves \na long, thin, flexible tube that's fitted with a video camera\nand light at the end and placed internally to examine\nthe colon for polyps. If polyps are found, a doctor\ncan do a polypectomy, a procedure that removes polyps\nfrom the colonic wall. Doctors can also then test\nthe polyp for cancerous cells. Colonoscopy is the only test that can\nbe used to both find and remove polyps. There are, however, \nother useful screening tests, including imaging and at-home tests that can allow patients to examine their stool \nfor small amounts of blood. Occasionally, polyps are too large\nto be removed during a colonoscopy, in which case, the next step is surgery. If blood and imaging tests then reveal that cancerous cells \nhave spread outside the colon, then a special treatment,\nlike chemotherapy, may also be required to stop\nthe cancer from escalating. We can also take on certain habits to reduce our likelihood of developing\ncolon cancer in the first place. There's evidence that maintaining\na healthy weight, not smoking, and being physically active can help. But most importantly, \naccess to healthcare and regular screenings \nat crucial times in life are the best ways to prevent colon cancer. "

        "text": "In the third millenium BCE, Mesopotamian kings recorded and\ninterpreted their dreams on wax tablets. A thousand years later, Ancient Egyptians wrote a dream book listing over a hundred common dreams\nand their meanings. And in the years since, we haven't paused in our quest\nto understand why we dream. So, after a great deal\nof scientific research, technological advancement, and persistence, we still don't have any definite answers,\nbut we have some interesting theories. We dream to fulfill our wishes. In the early 1900s, Sigmund Freud proposed that while all\nof our dreams, including our nightmares, are a collection of images\nfrom our daily conscious lives, they also have symbolic meanings, which relate to the fulfillment\nof our subconscious wishes. Freud theorized that everything \nwe remember when we wake up from a dream is a symbolic representation of our unconscious primitive thoughts,\nurges, and desires. Freud believed that by analyzing\nthose remembered elements, the unconscious content would be revealed\nto our conscious mind, and psychological issues stemming\nfrom its repression could be addressed and resolved. We dream to remember. To increase performance \non certain mental tasks, sleep is good, but dreaming while sleeping is better. In 2010, researchers found that subjects were much better \nat getting through a complex 3-D maze if they had napped and dreamed\nof the maze prior to their second attempt. In fact, they were up to \nten times better at it than those who only thought of the maze\nwhile awake between attempts, and those who napped but did not dream\nabout the maze. Researchers theorize that certain\nmemory processes can happen only when we are asleep, and our dreams are a signal\nthat these processes are taking place. We dream to forget. There are about 10,000 trillion \nneural connections within the architecture of your brain. They are created by everything you think\nand everything you do. A 1983 neurobiological theory of dreaming,\ncalled reverse learning, holds that while sleeping,\nand mainly during REM sleep cycles, your neocortex reviews \nthese neural connections and dumps the unnecessary ones. Without this unlearning process, which results in your dreams, your brain could be overrun \nby useless connections and parasitic thoughts could disrupt\nthe necessary thinking you need to do while you're awake. We dream to keep our brains working. The continual activation theory proposes\nthat your dreams result from your brain's need to constantly\nconsolidate and create long-term memories in order to function properly. So when external input falls\nbelow a certain level, like when you're asleep, your brain automatically triggers the generation of data \nfrom its memory storages, which appear to you in the form of\nthe thoughts and feelings you experience in your dreams. In other words, your dreams might be\na random screen saver your brain turns on so it doesn't completely shut down. We dream to rehearse. Dreams involving dangerous and threatening\nsituations are very common, and the primitive instinct \nrehearsal theory holds that the content of a dream\nis significant to its purpose. Whether it's an anxiety-filled night of\nbeing chased through the woods by a bear or fighting off a ninja in a dark alley, these dreams allow you to practice\nyour fight or flight instincts and keep them sharp and dependable\nin case you'll need them in real life. But it doesn't always have \nto be unpleasant. For instance, dreams \nabout your attractive neighbor could actually give your reproductive\ninstinct some practice, too. We dream to heal. Stress neurotransmitters in the brain\nare much less active during the REM stage of sleep, even during dreams \nof traumatic experiences, leading some researchers to theorize that one purpose of dreaming is to take\nthe edge off painful experiences to allow for psychological healing. Reviewing traumatic events\nin your dreams with less mental stress may grant you a clearer perspective and enhanced ability to process them\nin psychologically healthy ways. People with certain mood disorders\nand PTSD often have difficulty sleeping, leading some scientists to believe\nthat lack of dreaming may be a contributing factor\nto their illnesses. We dream to solve problems. Unconstrained by reality\nand the rules of conventional logic, in your dreams, your mind can create\nlimitless scenarios to help you grasp problems and formulate solutions\nthat you may not consider while awake. John Steinbeck called it \nthe committee of sleep, and research has demonstrated the effectiveness of dreaming \non problem solving. It's also how renowned chemist \nAugust Kekule discovered the structure \nof the benzene molecule, and it's the reason that sometimes \nthe best solution for a problem is to sleep on it. And those are just a few of the more\nprominent theories. As technology increases our capability\nfor understanding the brain, it's possible that one day we will discover \nthe definitive reason for them. But until that time arrives,\nwe'll just have to keep on dreaming. "

These foods may taste \ncompletely different, but all of these phenomena come from\ntiny organisms chowing down on sugar and belching up some culinary byproducts. Let's start with yeast. Yeast are single-celled fungi \nused to make bread, beer, and wine, among other products. Yeast break down carbohydrates,\nlike sugar, to get energy \nand the molecules they need to function. They have two different ways to do this: the oxygen-dependent, or aerobic, pathway, and the oxygen-independent, \nanaerobic pathway, which is also called fermentation. When you bake bread,\nyeast can use both pathways, but they normally prefer to start with\nthe anaerobic process of fermentation. In this process, ethanol is produced\nin addition to CO2. No, bread isn't alcoholic. Small amounts of alcohol that are secreted\nevaporate during baking. In the aerobic, \nor oxygen-dependent pathway, the yeast consume some of the sugar and produce carbon dioxide gas,\nor CO2, and water. In both processes, the CO2 accumulates\nand creates tiny bubbles. These bubbles get trapped by gluten\nand create a sponge-like structure that gives the bread its soft texture. Wine also relies on yeast. But a wine-making set-up \nkeeps the oxygen levels low so that yeast consume sugar \nusing fermentation, the anaerobic pathway. The process often starts with wild yeasts\nalready hanging out on the grapes. But to get consistent results, most winemakers also add \ncarefully selected strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol. The yeast consume the sugar\nin the grape juice, and as the sugar level drops, the alcohol level rises. This doesn't necessarily mean \nthat sweeter wines have less alcohol. Different types of grapes start with\ndifferent amounts of sugar, and sugar can also be added. What happens to the carbon dioxide? It just bubbles away through a vent. In carbonated alcoholic beverages,\nlike champagne and beer, sealed containers are used in primary\nor secondary fermentation to keep the carbon dioxide in the bottle. Wine also introduces us to our second\ntype of food-producing microorganism: bacteria. A special strain of bacteria turns a tart compound in grape juice\ninto softer tasting ones that are responsible for some of\nthe flavors in red wines and chardonnays. Another type of bacteria,\ncalled acetic acid bacteria, isn't so desirable in wine, but they have their function, too. If there's oxygen around, these bacteria convert the ethanol in wine\ninto, well, acetic acid. Let this process continue\nand you'll eventually get vinegar. Bacteria are the key for cheese, too. To make cheese, \nmilk is inoculated with bacteria. The bacteria gobble up the lactose,\na kind of sugar, and produce lactic acid,\nalong with many other chemicals. As the milk gets more and more acidic, its proteins start to aggregate \nand curdle. That's why spoiled milk is clumpy. Cheesemakers usually add an enzyme\ncalled rennet, naturally found inside of cows, goats,\nand some other mammals to help this process along. Eventually, those little curdles turn into\nbigger curds, which are pressed \nto squeeze out the water, and create a firm cheese. Different strains of bacteria\nmake different kinds of cheese. For example, a species of bacteria\nthat emits carbon dioxide is what gives swiss cheese\nits characteristic holes. Some cheeses, brie and camembert,\nuse another kind of microorganism, too: mold. So your kitchen functions as a sort of\nbiotechnology lab manned by microorganisms \nthat culture your cuisine. Yogurt, soy sauce, sour cream, sauerkraut, kefir, kimchi, kombucha, \ncheddar, challah, pita, and naan. But maybe not all at the same dinner. "

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Jessica Ruby How big was that fish you caught? This big? This big? This big? Without photographic evidence, there's nothing that proves you caught a whopper, and that's been true since the dawn of fishing. In fact, hundreds of years ago, long before photography could capture the moment, Japanese fishermen invented their own way to record trophy catches. They called it Gyotaku. Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish that originated in Japan as a way to record trophy catches prior to the modern day camera. Gyo means fish and taku means impression. There are several different stories about how Gyotaku came about, but it basically started with fishermen needing a way to record the species and size of the fish they caught over 100 years ago. Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes out to sea with them. They told stories of great adventures at sea. Since the Japanese revered certain fish, the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish and release them. To make the rubbing, they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink and print them on rice paper. This way they could be released or cleaned and sold at market. The first prints like this were for records only with no extra details. It wasn't until the mid 1800's that they began painting eye details and other embellishments onto the prints. One famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman, and, when he made a large catch, he wanted to preserve the memory of the large, red sea bream. To do so, he commissioned a fisherman to print his catch. After this, many fisherman would bring their Gyotaku prints to Lord Sakai, and if he liked their work, he would hire them to print for him. Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period. After this period, Gyotaku was not as popular and began to fade away. Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form, enjoyed by many. And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen. But the art form is quite different than it used to be. Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error. Before the artist begins to print, the fish needs to be prepared for printing. First, the artist places the fish on a hollowed out surface. Then the artist spreads the fins out and pins them down on the board to dry. They then clean the fish with water. When it comes time to print, there are two different methods. The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper onto the fish using rice paste. Then, the artist uses a tompo, or a cotton ball covered in silk, to put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print. This method requires more skill and great care needs to be taken when pulling the paper off the fish so the paper doesn't tear. In the direct method, the artist paints directly on the fish, and then gently presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish. With both of these methods, no two prints are exactly alike, but both reveal dramatic images of the fish. For the final touch, the artist uses a chop, or a stamp, and signs their work, and can hold it up to say, \"The fish was exactly this big!\" "

Deep in the bowels of the animal kingdom,\nfarts can serve as tools of intimidation, acts of self-defense, and even\nweapons of malodorous murder. The smelliest parts in the animal kingdom \naren’t lethal, but they might ruin \nyour trip to the beach. Seals and sea lions are well-known for\nhaving truly foul farts due to their diet. Fish and shellfish are incredibly high\nin sulfur. And during digestion, mammalian \ngut bacteria breaks down sulfur and amino acids containing sulfur\nto produce hydrogen disulphide, a gas with a smell resembling rotten eggs. Seals and sea lions can’t help\ntheir funky flatulence, But some animals deploy \ntheir farts strategically. Both the Eastern hognose snake and\nthe Sonoran coral snake use a tactic called cloacal popping. This involves sucking air \ninto their cloaca— a hole used for urinating, defecating \nand reproduction— and then shooting it back out \nwith a loud pop. These pops are no more dangerous\nthan a sea lion’s stench, but they are effective at scaring\noff would-be predators. Meanwhile, the flatulence of beaded \nlacewing larvae are silent and deadly. Their farts contain a class\nof chemical known as allomone that has evolved specifically\nto paralyze termites. In fact, this allomone is so powerful, a single fart can immobilize multiple\ntermites for up to three hours, or even kill them outright. Either way, these toxic farts give \nbeaded lacewing larvae plenty of time to devour prey \nup to three times their size. For some other animals, however,\nholding farts in can be deadly. The Bolson pupfish is a small freshwater\nfish found in northern Mexico. These fish feed on algae and other\nsmall organisms in the sediment. But during the hottest days of the summer, this algae produces a lot of gas. If a pupfish doesn’t fart this gas out, \nit becomes buoyant— making it easy prey for passing birds. And it isn't just predators\nthey have to worry about. Excessive gas buildup can actually\nburst their digestive systems. Researchers have found groups \nof several hundred dead pupfish that failed to fart \nfor their lives. Fortunately for humanity, animal farts can’t directly harm a human—\noutside making us lose our lunch. But in the right circumstances, some animal flatulence can create\nsurprisingly dangerous conditions. In the fall of 2015, a tripped smoke alarm forced a plane to make \nan emergency landing. Upon further inspection, officials\nfound that there was no fire— just the burps and farts of over 2,000\ngoats being transported in the cargo bay. The change in air pressure had caused\nthem to pass gas en masse. Thankfully, this story of farting goats \nhad relatively low costs. But the most dangerous flatulence \nin the world may actually come from a similarly unassuming mammal:\nthe humble cow. There are nearly one billion\ncows in the world, most of them raised specifically\nfor milk and meat. Like goats, cows are ruminants, which means their stomachs \nhave four chambers, allowing them to chew, digest \nand regurgitate their food multiple times. This process helps them extract extra\nnutrients from their food, but it also produces a lot of gas. This is particularly troubling\nbecause one of the gases cows emit is methane, a major greenhouse gas that contributes \nheavily to global warming. One kilogram of methane traps dozens \nof times more heat in the atmosphere than one kilogram of carbon dioxide. And with each cow releasing \nup to 100 kilograms of methane every year, these animals have become \none of the biggest contributors toward climate change. So while other animals may have louder,\nfouler, or even more toxic farts, cow flatulence may be the most\ndangerous gas ever to pass. "

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Jessica Ruby What's an algorithm? In computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions for solving some problem, step-by-step. Typically, algorithms are executed by computers, but we humans have algorithms as well. For instance, how would you go about counting the number of people in a room? Well, if you're like me, you probably point at each person, one at a time, and count up from 0: 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth. Well, that's an algorithm. In fact, let's try to express it a bit more formally in pseudocode, English-like syntax that resembles a programming language. Let n equal 0. For each person in room, set n = n + 1. How to interpret this pseudocode? Well, line 1 declares, so to speak, a variable called n and initializes its value to zero. This just means that at the beginning of our algorithm, the thing with which we're counting has a value of zero. After all, before we start counting, we haven't counted anything yet. Calling this variable n is just a convention. I could have called it almost anything. Now, line 2 demarks the start of loop, a sequence of steps that will repeat some number of times. So, in our example, the step we're taking is counting people in the room. Beneath line 2 is line 3, which describes exactly how we'll go about counting. The indentation implies that it's line 3 that will repeat. So, what the pseudocode is saying is that after starting at zero, for each person in the room, we'll increase n by 1. Now, is this algorithm correct? Well, let's bang on it a bit. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For each of these two people, we then increment n by 1. So, in the first trip through the loop, we update n from zero to 1, on the second trip through that same loop, we update n from 1 to 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. So far, so good. How about a corner case, though? Suppose that there are zero people in the room, besides me, who's doing the counting. In line 1, we again initialize n to zero. This time, though, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there isn't a person in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Pretty simple, right? But counting people one a time is pretty inefficient, too, no? Surely, we can do better! Why not count two people at a time? Instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so forth, why not count 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on? It even sounds faster, and it surely is. Let's express this optimization in pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. Pretty simple change, right? Rather than count people one at a time, we instead count them two at a time. This algorithm's thus twice as fast as the last. But is it correct? Let's see. Does it work if there are 2 people in the room? In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For that one pair of people, we then increment n by 2. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. Suppose next that there are zero people in the room. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. As before, line 3 doesn't execute at all since there aren't any pairs of people in the room, and so, n remains zero, which indeed matches the number of people in the room. But what if there are 3 people in the room? How does this algorithm fair? Let's see. In line 1, we initialize n to zero. For a pair of those people, we then increment n by 2, but then what? There isn't another full pair of people in the room, so line 2 no longer applies. And so, by this algorithm's end, n is still 2, which isn't correct. Indeed this algorithm is said to be buggy because it has a mistake. Let's redress with some new pseudocode. Let n equal zero. For each pair of people in room, set n = n + 2. If 1 person remains unpaired, set n = n + 1. To solve this particular problem, we've introduced in line 4 a condition, otherwise known as a branch, that only executes if there is one person we could not pair with another. So now, whether there's 1 or 3 or any odd number of people in the room, this algorithm will now count them. Can we do even better? Well, we could count in 3's or 4's or even 5's and 10's, but beyond that it's going to get a little bit difficult to point. At the end of the day, whether executed by computers or humans, algorithms are just a set of instructions with which to solve problems. These were just three. What problem would you solve with an algorithm? "

A ravenous snake that is capable of\ndevouring an alligator. Rabbit populations that eat\nthemselves into starvation. These aren't horror movie concepts. They're real stories, but how could such situations\nexist in nature? All three are examples\nof invasive species, organisms harmful not because\nof what they are, but where they happen to be. The kudzu vine, for example, had grown quality in its native east Asia,\neaten by various insects and dying off during the cold winters. But its fortunes changed when it was imported \ninto the southeastern United States for porch decoration and cattle feed. Its planting was even subsidized\nby the government to fight soil erosion. With sunny fields, a mild climate,\nand no natural predators in its new home, the vine grew uncontrollably until it became known as the plant\nthat ate the South. Meanwhile in Florida's Everglades,\nBurmese pythons, thought to have been released\nby pet owners, are the cause of decreasing populations\nof organisms. They're successfully outcompeting\ntop predators, such as the alligator and panther, causing a significant reduction\nin their food sources. They're not a problem\nin their native Asia because diseases, parasites, and predators\nhelp to control their population size. And in Australia, European rabbits\neat so many plants that they wipe out the food supply\nfor themselves and other herbivores. They're a pretty recent addition, intentionally introduced to the continent\nbecause one man enjoyed hunting them. Like the Burmese pythons, various factors in their native habitat\nkeep their numbers in control. But in Australia, the lack of predators and a climate perfect \nfor year-long reproduction allows their populations to skyrocket. So why does this keep happening? Most of the world's ecosystems are the result of millennia \nof coevolution by organisms, adapting to their environment \nand each other until a stable balance is reached. Healthy ecosystems maintain this balance\nvia limiting factors, environmental conditions that restrict\nthe size or range of a species. These include things \nlike natural geography and climate, food availability, and the presence or absence of predators. For example, plant growth depends\non levels of sunlight and soil nutrients. The amount of edible plants affects\nthe population of herbivores, which in turn impacts the carnivores\nthat feed on them. And a healthy predator population keeps\nthe herbivores from becoming too numerous and devouring all the plants. But even minor changes in one factor\ncan upset this balance, and the sudden introduction\nof non-native organisms can be a pretty major change. A species that is evolved\nin a separate habitat will be susceptible to different \nlimiting factors, different predators, different energy sources, and different climates. If the new habitat's limiting factors\nfail to restrict the species growth, it will continue to multiply, out-competing native organisms\nfor resources and disrupting the entire ecosystem. Species are sometimes introduced\ninto new habitats through natural factors, like storms, ocean currents, or climate shifts. The majority of invasive species,\nthough, are introduced by humans. Often this happens unintentionally, as when the zebra mussel was accidentally\nbrought to Lake Erie by cargo ships. But as people migrate around the world, we have also deliberately brought\nour plants and animals along, rarely considering the consequences. But now that we're learning more about the effects of invasive species\non ecosystems, many governments closely monitor\nthe transport of plants and animals, and ban the imports of certain organisms. But could the species with\nthe most drastic environmental impact be a group of primates who emerged\nfrom Africa to cover most of the world? Are we an invasive species? "

        "text": "The Five Fingers of Evolution. A thorough understanding of biology requires a thorough understanding\nof the process of evolution. Most people are familiar\nwith the process of natural selection. However, this is just one\nof five processes that can result in evolution. Before we discuss\nall five of these processes, we should define evolution. Evolution is simply change\nin the gene pool over time. But what is a gene pool? And for that matter, what is a gene? Before spending any more time on genetics, let us begin with a story. Imagine that a boat capsizes, and 10 survivors\nswim to shore on a deserted island. They are never rescued, and they form a new population\nthat exists for thousands of years. Strangely enough,\nfive of the survivors have red hair. Red hair is created\nwhen a person inherits two copies of the red gene from their parents. If you only have one copy of the gene,\nyou won't have red hair. To make this easier, we will assume that the five non-redheads\nare not carriers of the gene. The initial frequency of the red-hair gene\nis therefore 50 percent, or 10 of 20 total genes. These genes are the gene pool. The 20 different genes\nare like cards in a deck that keep getting reshuffled\nwith each new generation. Sex is simply a reshuffling\nof the genetic deck. The cards are reshuffled\nand passed to the next generation; the deck remains the same, 50 percent red. The genes are reshuffled\nand passed to the next generation; the gene pool remains\nthe same, 50 percent red. Even though the population\nmay grow in size over time, the frequency should stay\nat about 50 percent. If this frequency ever varies,\nthen evolution has occurred. Evolution is simply change\nin the gene pool over time. Think about it in terms of the cards. If the frequency of the cards\nin the deck ever changes, evolution has occurred. There are five processes\nthat can cause the frequency to change. To remember these processes,\nwe will use the fingers on your hands, starting from the little finger\nand moving to the thumb. The little finger should remind you\nthat the population can shrink. If the population shrinks,\nthen chance can take over. For example, if only four\nindividuals survive an epidemic, then their genes will represent\nthe new gene pool. The next finger is the ring finger. This finger should remind you of mating,\nbecause a ring represents a couple. If individuals choose a mate\nbased on their appearance or location, the frequency may change. If redheaded individuals only mate\nwith redheaded individuals, they could eventually\nform a new population. If no one ever mates\nwith redheaded individuals, these genes could decrease. The next finger is the middle finger. The M in the middle finger should remind\nyou of the M in the word \"mutation.\" If a new gene is added through mutation,\nit can affect the frequency. Imagine a gene mutation\ncreates a new color of hair. This would obviously change\nthe frequency in the gene pool. The pointer finger\nshould remind you of movement. If new individuals\nflow into an area, or immigrate, the frequency will change. If individuals flow out\nof an area, or emigrate, then the frequency will change. In science, we refer to this\nmovement as gene flow. All four of the processes represented\nby our fingers can cause evolution. Small population size, non-random mating, mutations and gene flow. However, none of them lead to adaptation. Natural selection is the only process that creates organisms\nbetter adapted to their local environment. I use the thumb to remember this process. Nature votes thumbs up for adaptations\nthat will do well in their environment, and thumbs down to adaptations\nthat will do poorly. The genes for individuals\nthat are not adapted for their environment will gradually be replaced\nby those that are better adapted. Red hair is an example\nof one of these adaptations. Red hair is an advantage\nin the northern climates, because the fair skin\nallowed ancestors to absorb more light and synthesize more vitamin D. Thumbs up! However, this was a disadvantage\nin the more southern climates, where increased UV radiation\nled to cancer and decreased fertility. Thumbs down! Even the thumb itself is an adaptation formed through the process\nof natural selection. The evolution that we have described\nis referred to as microevolution, because it refers to a small change. However, this form of evolution may eventually lead\nto macroevolution, or speciation. Every organism on the planet shares\nancestry with a single common ancestor. All living organisms on the planet\nare connected back in time through the process of evolution. Take a look at your own hand. It's an engineering masterpiece that was created by the five\nprocesses I just described, over millions and millions of years. Can you recall the five main\ncauses of evolution from memory? If you can't, hit rewind\nand watch that part again. But if you can, give yourself or your neighbor\na big five-fingered high five. "

That between the mouse click\nand the video playing, there was something\nthat captured your intention, understood it, and made it real? What is that something? Is it gremlins? Let's imagine that we can shrink down to the size of an electron and inject ourselves\ninto a click of a mouse. If you took your mouse apart, you'd see that it's really\na very simple machine. It has a couple buttons and a system for detecting\nmotion and distance. You might have an optical mouse that makes these measurements\nwith lights and sensors, but older ones did this\nwith a hard rubber ball and some plastic wheels. Same concept. When you click the button on your mouse, it sends a message to the computer with information about its position. When your mouse click is received, it's handled by the basic\ninput/output subsystem. This subsystem acts like the eyes and ears and mouth and hands of the computer. Basically, it provides\na way for the computer to interact with its environment. But it also acts like a buffer to keep the CPU from being\noverwhelmed by distractions. In this case, the I/O subsystem decides that your mouse click is pretty important so it generates an interrupt to the CPU. \"Hey, CPU! Got a click here.\" The CPU, or central processing unit, is the brains of the whole computer. Just like your brain doesn't\ntake up your whole body, the CPU doesn't take\nup the whole computer, but it runs the show all the same. And the CPU's job, its whole job, is fetching instructions from memory and executing them. So, while you're typing, typing, typing, maybe really fast, like 60 words a minute, the CPU is fetching and executing billions of instructions a second. Yes, billions every second: instructions to move your mouse\naround on the screen, to run that clock widget on your desktop, play your internet radio, manage the files you're\nediting on the hard drive, and much, much more. Your computer's CPU\nis one heck of a multitasker! \"But oh my gosh there's a very important mouse click coming through now! Let's drop everything now\nand deal with that!\" There are programs for everything that the CPU does. A special program for the mouse, for the clock widget, for the internet radio, and for dealing with letters\nsent by the keyboard. Each program was initially\nwritten by a human in a human-readable programming language, like Java, C++, or Python. But human programs take up a lot of space and contain a lot of unnecessary\ninformation to a computer, so they are compiled and made smaller and stored in bits of ones\nand zeros in memory. The CPU realizes that it\nneeds instructions for how to deal with this mouse click, so it looks up the address\nfor the mouse program and sends a request\nto the memory subsystem for instructions stored there.

Because the CPU learns\nthat the mouse was clicked when the cursor was over a picture of a button on the monitor screen, and so, the CPU asks memory\nfor the monitor program to find out what that button is. And then the CPU has to ask memory for the program for the button, which means that the CPU needs the monitor program again to show the video\nassociated with the button, and so it goes. And let's just say there\nare a lot of programs involved before you even see\nthe button on the screen light up when you clicked it.

        "text": "On a December afternoon in Chicago\nduring the middle of World War II, scientists cracked open the nucleus\nat the center of the uranium atom and turned nuclear mass into energy\nover and over again. They did this by creating \nfor the first time a chain reaction inside a new\nengineering marvel: the nuclear reactor. Since then, the ability to mine great\namounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian\nsource of electricity. A modern nuclear reactor generates enough\nelectricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average American household\nfor nearly 34 years. But rather than dominate the global\nelectricity market, nuclear power has declined from\nan all-time high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. And it's expected to drop further\nin the coming decades. What happened to the great promise\nof this technology? It turns out nuclear power \nfaces many hurdles, including high construction costs and public opposition. And behind these problems lie \na series of unique engineering challenges. Nuclear power relies on the fission\nof uranium nuclei and a controlled chain reaction that reproduces this splitting\nin many more nuclei. The atomic nucleus is densely packed\nwith protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force. Most uranium atoms have a total\nof 238 protons and neutrons, but roughly one in every 140\nlacks three neutrons, and this lighter isotope is less\ntightly bound. Compared to its more abundant cousin, a strike by a neutron easily splits\nthe U-235 nuclei into lighter, radioactive elements\ncalled fission products, in addition to two to three neutrons, gamma rays, and a few neutrinos. During fission, some nuclear mass\ntransforms into energy. A fraction of the newfound energy\npowers the fast-moving neutrons, and if some of them strike uranium nuclei, fission results in a second \nlarger generation of neutrons. If this second generation of neutrons\nstrike more uranium nuclei, more fission results in an even\nlarger third generation, and so on. But inside a nuclear reactor, this spiraling chain reaction is tamed\nusing control rods made of elements that capture excess \nneutrons and keep their number in check. With a controlled chain reaction, a reactor draws power steadily\nand stably for years. The neutron-led chain reaction\nis a potent process driving nuclear power, but there's a catch that can result in unique demands \non the production of its fuel. It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted\nfrom fission have too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclei. The fission rate is too low\nand the chain reaction fizzles out. The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago\nused graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down \nneutrons just enough to increase their capture by uranium\nand raise the rate of fission. Modern reactors commonly use\npurified water as a moderator, but the scattered neutrons are still\na little too fast. To compensate \nand keep up the chain reaction, the concentration of U-235 is enriched to four to seven times \nits natural abundance. Today, enrichment is often done by\npassing a gaseous uranium compound through centrifuges to separate lighter U-235 \nfrom heavier U-238. But the same process can be continued\nto highly enrich U-235 up to 130 times its natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction\nin a bomb. Methods like centrifuge processing\nmust be carefully regulated to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel. Remember, only a fraction \nof the released fission energy goes into speeding up neutrons. Most of the nuclear power goes into the\nkinetic energy of the fission products. Those are captured inside the reactor\nas heat by a coolant, usually purified water. This heat is eventually used to drive\nan electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor. Water flow is critical \nnot only to create electricity, but also to guard against the most dreaded\ntype of reactor accident, the meltdown. If water flow stops because a pipe\ncarrying it breaks, or the pumps that push it fail, the uranium heats up very quickly\nand melts. During a nuclear meltdown, radioactive vapors escape \ninto the reactor, and if the reactor fails to hold them, a steel and concrete containment building\nis the last line of defense. But if the radioactive gas pressure\nis too high, containment fails and the gasses\nescape into the air, spreading as far \nand wide as the wind blows. The radioactive fission products\nin these vapors eventually decay into stable elements. While some decay in a few seconds, others take hundreds \nof thousands of years. The greatest challenge \nfor a nuclear reactor is to safely contain these products and keep them from harming humans\nor the environment. Containment doesn't stop mattering\nonce the fuel is used up. In fact, it becomes an even greater\nstorage problem. Every one to two years, some spent fuel is removed from reactors and stored in pools of water \nthat cool the waste and block its radioactive emissions. The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium\nthat failed to fission, fission products, and plutonium, a radioactive material\nnot found in nature. This mix must be isolated from\nthe environment until it has all safely decayed. Many countries propose deep time storage\nin tunnels drilled far underground, but none have been built, and there's great uncertainty about\ntheir long-term security. How can a nation that has existed\nfor only a few hundred years plan to guard plutonium\nthrough its radioactive half-life of 24,000 years? Today, many nuclear power plants\nsit on their waste, instead, storing them indefinitely on site. Apart from radioactivity, there's an\neven greater danger with spent fuel. Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction and can be mined from the waste\nto make bombs. Storing spent fuel is thus not only\na safety risk for the environment, but also a security risk for nations. Who should be the watchmen to guard it? Visionary scientists from the early years\nof the nuclear age pioneered how to reliably tap \nthe tremendous amount of energy inside an atom - as an explosive bomb and as a controlled power source\nwith incredible potential. But their successors have learned\nhumbling insights about the technology's not-so-utopian\nindustrial limits. Mining the subatomic realm makes for\ncomplex, expensive, and risky engineering. "

        "text": "The human eye is an amazing mechanism, able to detect anywhere \nfrom a few photons to direct sunlight, or switch focus from \nthe screen in front of you to the distant horizon \nin a third of a second. In fact, the structures required\nfor such incredible flexibility were once considered so complex that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged\nthat the idea of there having evolved seemed absurd in the \nhighest possible degree. And yet, that is exactly what happened,\nstarting more than 500 million years ago. The story of the human eye begins\nwith a simple light spot, such as the one found \nin single-celled organisms, like euglena. This is a cluster \nof light-sensitive proteins linked to the organism's flagellum, activating when it finds light\nand, therefore, food. A more complex version of this light spot\ncan be found in the flat worm, planaria. Being cupped, rather than flat, enables it to better sense\nthe direction of the incoming light. Among its other uses, this ability allows an organism\nto seek out shade and hide from predators. Over the millenia, as such light cups grew deeper\nin some organisms, the opening at the front grew smaller. The result was a pinhole effect,\nwhich increased resolution dramatically, reducing distortion by only allowing\na thin beam of light into the eye. The nautilus, \nan ancestor of the octopus, uses this pinhole eye for improved \nresolution and directional sensing. Although the pinhole eye allows\nfor simple images, the key step towards the eye \nas we know it is a lens. This is thought to have evolved through transparent cells covering \nthe opening to prevent infection, allowing the inside of the eye\nto fill with fluid that optimizes light sensitivity\nand processing. Crystalline proteins \nforming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light \nat a single point on the retina. It is this lens that is the key\nto the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt\nto near and far vision. This structure of the pinhole camera\nwith a lens served as the basis for what would \neventually evolve into the human eye. Further refinements would include\na colored ring, called the iris, that controls the amount \nof light entering the eye, a tough white outer layer,\nknown as the sclera, to maintain its structure, and tear glands that secrete \na protective film. But equally important was the accompanying evolution\nof the brain, with its expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper\nand more colorful images it was receiving. We now know that far from being\nan ideal masterpiece of design, our eye bares traces\nof its step by step evolution. For example,\nthe human retina is inverted, with light-detecting cells facing away\nfrom the eye opening. This results in a blind spot, where the optic nerve\nmust pierce the retina to reach the photosensitive \nlayer in the back. The similar looking eyes \nof cephalopods, which evolved independently, have a front-facing retina,\nallowing them to see without a blind spot. Other creatures' eyes display\ndifferent adaptations. Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish, have eyes divided in two sections\nfor looking above and under water, perfect for spotting \nboth predators and prey. Cats, classically nighttime hunters,\nhave evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount of light\nthe eye can detect, granting them excellent night vision,\nas well as their signature glow. These are just a few examples of the huge \ndiversity of eyes in the animal kingdom. So if you could design an eye, \nwould you do it any differently? This question isn't as strange \nas it might sound. Today, doctors and scientists are looking\nat different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants\nfor the vision impaired. And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision\nand flexibilty of the human eye may even enable it to surpass\nits own evolution. "

        "text": "In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated\nmuch farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route. But this wasn't a stroke of luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher\nthan anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed\nthey had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon\nthat has destroyed countless others: a tsunami. Although tsunamis are commonly\nknown as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated\nto the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces\nof the Sun and Moon. In many ways, tsunamis are just\nlarger versions of regular waves. They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water. The difference is\nin where this energy comes from. For normal ocean waves,\nit comes from wind. Because this only affects the surface,\nthe waves are limited in size and speed. But tsunamis are caused by energy\noriginating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly,\nan earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates\nof the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount\nof energy into the water. This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above\nthe normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple\noutwards horizontally. Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour. When it's far from shore,\na tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through\nthe entire depth of the water. But when it reaches shallow water,\nsomething called wave shoaling occurs. Because there is less water\nto move through, this still massive amount\nof energy is compressed. The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises\nto as much as 100 feet. The word tsunami,\nJapanese for \"harbor wave,\" comes from the fact that it only seems\nto appear near the coast. If the trough of a tsunami\nreaches shore first, the water will withdraw\nfarther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous. A tsunami will not only drown\npeople near the coast, but level buildings and trees\nfor a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas. As if that weren't enough,\nthe water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone,\nunfortunate enough to be caught in its path. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest\nnatural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people\nthroughout South Asia. So how can we protect ourselves\nagainst this destructive force of nature? People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis\nwith sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water. But these are not always effective. In 2011, a tsunami\nsurpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives. Many scientists and policy makers\nare instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure\nand seismic activity, and establishing global\ncommunication networks for quickly distributing alerts. When nature is too powerful to stop, the safest course\nis to get out of its way. "

So in the space race of the 21st century, some engineers are abandoning rockets\nfor something much more exciting: elevators. Okay, so maybe riding an elevator\nto the stars isn't the most thrilling mode\nof transportation. But using a fixed structure to send\nsmaller payloads of astronauts and equipment into orbit would be safer, easier, and cheaper\nthan conventional rockets. On a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, every kilogram of cargo costs\nroughly $7,500 to carry into orbit. Space elevators are projected\nto reduce that cost by 95%. Researchers have been investigating\nthis idea since 1895, when a visit to what was then\nthe world's tallest structure inspired Russian scientist\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky. Tsiolkovsky imagined a structure\nthousands of kilometers tall, but even a century later,\nno known material is strong enough to support such a building. Fortunately, the laws of physics offer\na promising alternative design. Imagine hopping\non a fast-spinning carousel while holding a rope attached to a rock. As long as the carousel keeps spinning,\nthe rock and rope will remain horizontal, kept aloft by centrifugal force. If you're holding the rope, you'll feel\nthis apparent, inertial acceleration pulling the rock away from the center\nof the rotating carousel. Now, if we replace the carousel\nwith Earth, the rope with a long tether,\nand the rock with a counterweight, we have just envisioned\nthe modern space elevator— a cable pulled into space\nby the physics of our spinning planet. For this to work, the counterweight would\nneed to be far enough away that the centrifugal force\ngenerated by the Earth's spin is greater than the planet's\ngravitational pull. These forces balance out at roughly\n36,000 kilometers above the surface, so the counterweight should be\nbeyond this height. Objects at this specific distance\nare in geostationary orbit, meaning they revolve around Earth\nat the same rate the planet spins, thus appearing motionless in the sky. The counterweight itself\ncould be anything, even a captured asteroid. From here, the tether could be released\ndown through the atmosphere and connected to a base station\non the planet's surface. To maximize centrifugal acceleration, this anchor point should be close\nto the Equator. And by making the loading station\na mobile ocean base, the entire system could be moved at will, allowing it to maneuver\naround extreme weather, and dodge debris and satellites in space. Once established, cargo could be loaded\nonto devices called climbers, which would pull packages\nalong the cable and into orbit. These mechanisms would require\nhuge amounts of electricity, which could be provided by solar panels\nor potentially even nuclear systems. Current designs estimate that\nit would take about 8 days to elevate an object\ninto geostationary orbit. And with proper radiation shielding, humans could theoretically\ntake the ride too. So, what's stopping us from building\nthis massive structure? For one thing, a construction accident\ncould be catastrophic. But the main problem lies\nin the cable itself. In addition to supporting\na massive amount of weight, the cable's material would have\nto be strong enough to withstand the counterweight's pull. And because this tension and the force\nof gravity would vary at different points, its strength and thickness would\nneed to vary as well. Engineered materials like carbon\nnanotubes and diamond nano-threads seem like our best hope\nfor producing materials strong and light enough for the job. But so far, we've only been able to manufacture\nvery small nanotube chains. Another option would be to build\none somewhere with weaker gravity. Space elevators based on Mars or the Moon are already possible\nwith existing materials. But the huge economic advantage of\nowning an Earth-based space elevator has inspired numerous countries\nto try and crack this conundrum. In fact, some companies\nin China and Japan are already planning\nto complete construction by 2050. "

        "text": "At any given moment, trillions of cells \nare traveling through your blood vessels, sometimes circling the body \nin just one minute. Each of these cells \nhas its origins deep in your bones. Bones might seem rock-solid, \nbut they’re actually quite porous inside. Large and small blood vessels \nenter through these holes. And inside most of the large bones \nof your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow. Marrow contains fat \nand other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements \nare blood stem cells. These stem cells are constantly dividing. They can differentiate \ninto red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and send about hundreds of billions \nof new blood cells into circulation every day. These new cells enter the bloodstream through holes \nin small capillaries in the marrow. Through the capillaries, they reach larger blood vessels \nand exit the bone. If there’s a problem with your blood, there’s a good chance \nit can be traced back to the bone marrow. Blood cancers often begin \nwith genetic mutations in the stem cells. The stem cells themselves \nare not cancerous, but these mutations can interfere \nwith the process of differentiation and result in malignant blood cells. So for patients with advanced \nblood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is often \nan allogeneic bone marrow transplant, which replaces the patient’s bone marrow \nwith a donor’s. Here’s how it works. First, blood stem cells \nare extracted from the donor. Most commonly, blood stem cells are filtered out \nof the donor’s bloodstream by circulating the blood \nthrough a machine that separates it \ninto different components. In other cases, \nthe marrow is extracted directly from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, \nwith a needle. Meanwhile, the recipient \nprepares for the transplant. High doses of chemotherapy or radiation \nkill the patient’s existing marrow, destroying both malignant cells \nand blood stem cells. This also weakens the immune system, making it less likely \nto attack the transplanted cells. Then the donor cells are infused into \nthe patient’s body through a central line. They initially circulate \nin the recipient’s peripheral bloodstream, but molecules on the stem cells, \ncalled chemokines, act as homing devices and quickly traffic them \nback to the marrow. Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to multiply and start producing\nnew, healthy blood cells. Just a small population \nof blood stem cells can regenerate a whole body’s \nworth of healthy marrow. A bone marrow transplant \ncan also lead to something called graft-versus-tumor activity, when new immune cells \ngenerated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’s \noriginal immune system couldn’t. This phenomenon can help eradicate \nstubborn blood cancers. But bone marrow transplants \nalso come with risks, including graft-versus-host disease. It happens when the immune system \ngenerated by the donor cells attacks the patient’s organs. This life-threatening condition \noccurs in about 30–50% of patients who receive donor cells \nfrom anyone other than an identical twin, particularly when the stem cells \nare collected from the blood \nas opposed to the bone marrow. Patients may take \nimmunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed \nfrom the donated sample in order to reduce the risk \nof graft-versus-host disease. But even if a patient \navoids graft-versus-host disease, their immune system \nmay reject the donor cells. So it’s crucial to find the best match \npossible in the first place. Key regions of the genetic code \ndetermine how the immune system identifies foreign cells. If these regions are similar \nin the donor and the recipient, the recipient’s immune system \nis more likely to accept the donor cells. Because these genes are inherited, \nthe best matches are often siblings. But many patients \nwho need a bone marrow transplant don’t have a matched family member. Those patients \nturn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone marrow. All it takes to be on the registry is \na cheek swab to test for a genetic match. And in many cases, \nthe donation itself isn’t much more complicated \nthan giving blood. It’s a way to save someone’s life with a resource \nthat’s completely renewable. "

        "text": "Twenty thousand years ago, the Earth was a frigid landscape where \nwoolly mammoths roamed. Huge ice sheets, \nseveral thousand meters thick, encased parts of North America, \nAsia, and Europe. We commonly know it as the \"Ice Age.\" But geologists call it \nthe Last Glacial Maximum. That’s because it’s the most recent\ntime that ice reached such a huge extent, and “ice age” is an informal term \nwithout a single agreed-upon definition. Over the last million years, there have actually been \nabout 10 different glacial maxima. Throughout Earth’s history, \nclimate has varied greatly. For hundreds of millions of years, the planet had no polar ice caps. Without this ice, \nthe sea level was 70 meters higher. At the other extreme, \nabout 700 million years ago, Earth became almost \nentirely covered in ice during an event known \nas “Snowball Earth.” So what causes these massive swings \nin the planet’s climate? One of the main drivers \nis atmospheric carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat. Natural processes, such as volcanism, chemical weathering of rocks, and the burial of organic matter, can cause huge changes in carbon dioxide \nwhen they continue for millions of years. Over the past million years, \ncarbon dioxide has been relatively low, and repeated glacial maxima have been caused by cycles \nin Earth’s movement around the sun. As Earth rotates, it wobbles on its axis \nand its tilt changes, altering the amount of sunlight that \nstrikes different parts of its surface. These wobbles, combined \nwith the planet’s elliptical orbit, cause summer temperatures to vary depending on whether the summer solstice \nhappens when Earth is closer or farther from the sun. Approximately every 100,000 years, these factors align to create dramatically\ncolder conditions that last for millennia. Cool summers that aren’t warm enough \nto melt the preceding winter’s snow allow ice to accumulate year after year. These ice sheets produce \nadditional cooling by reflecting more solar energy \nback into space. Simultaneously, cooler conditions \ntransfer carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the ocean, causing even more cooling \nand glacier expansion. About 20,000 years ago, these trends reversed when changes \nin Earth’s orbit increased summer sunshine over the giant ice sheets, \nand they began to melt. The sea level rose 130 meters and carbon dioxide was released \nfrom the ocean back into the atmosphere. By analyzing pollen and marine fossils, geologists can tell that temperatures \npeaked about 6,000 years ago, before another shift in Earth’s orbit\ncaused renewed cooling. So what’s coming next? Based on the repeated natural cycle seen \nin the climate record, we’d normally expect the Earth \nto continue a trend of gradual cooling for the next few thousand years. However, this cooling abruptly \nreversed about 150 years ago. Why? Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere \nhave been rising since the 19th century, when fossil fuel use increased. We know that from studying air bubbles \ntrapped in Antarctic ice. This surge in carbon dioxide \nalso coincides with a global temperature increase \nof nearly one degree Celsius. Ice cores \nand atmospheric monitoring stations show us that carbon dioxide levels \nare rising faster, and to higher levels, than at any point \nin the last 800,000 years. Computer models forecast another one to\nfour degrees Celsius of warming by 2100, depending on how much \nadditional fossil fuel we burn. What does that mean for the ice currently \non Greenland and Antarctica? Past climate changes suggest that even \na small warming shift can begin a process of ice melt \nthat continues for thousands of years. By the end of this century, ice melt is expected to raise \nthe sea level by 30 to 100 centimeters, enough to impact many coastal cities \nand island nations. If a four-degree Celsius warming persisted\nfor several millennia, the sea level could rise \nby as much as 10 meters. By studying past climates, scientists learn more about what drives \nthe shifts in ice that have shaped our planet \nfor millions of years. Research suggests that \nby taking action now to reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions quickly, we still have the opportunity to curb \nice loss and save our coastal communities. "

        "text": "The idea of human rights \nis that each one of us, no matter who we are \nor where we are born, is entitled to the same \nbasic rights and freedoms. Human rights are not privileges, and they cannot be granted or revoked. They are inalienable and universal. That may sound straighforward enough, but it gets incredibly complicated as soon as anyone tries \nto put the idea into practice. What exactly are the basic human rights? Who gets to pick them? Who enforces them, and how? The history behind \nthe concept of human rights is a long one. Throughout the centuries and across\nsocieties, religions, and cultures we have struggled with defining notions\nof rightfulness, justice, and rights. But one of the most modern affirmations\nof universal human rights emerged from the ruins of World War II\nwith the creation of the United Nations. The treaty that established the UN\ngives as one of its purposes to reaffirm faith in \nfundamental human rights. And with the same spirit, in 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This document, written by an international\ncommittee chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, lays the basis for modern \ninternational human rights law. The declaration is based on the principle that all human beings are born\nfree and equal in dignity and rights. It lists 30 articles recognizing,\namong other things, the principle of nondiscrimination\nand the right to life and liberty. It refers to negative freedoms,\nlike the freedom from torture or slavery, as well as positive freedoms, such as the freedom \nof movement and residence. It encompasses basic civil\nand political rights, such as freedom of expression, religion,\nor peaceful assembly, as well as social, economic,\nand cultural rights, such as the right to education and the right to freely \nchoose one's occupation and be paid and treated fairly. The declaration takes no sides\nas to which rights are more important, insisting on their universality, indivisibility, and interdependence. And in the past decades,\ninternational human rights law has grown, deepening and expanding our understanding\nof what human rights are, and how to better protect them. So if these principles \nare so well-developed, then why are human rights abused\nand ignored time and time again all over the world? The problem in general\nis that it is not at all easy to universally enforce these rights\nor to punish transgressors. The UDHR itself, despite being\nhighly authoritative and respected, is a declaration, not a hard law. So when individual countries violate it, the mechanisms to address \nthose violations are weak. For example, the main bodies within the UN\nin charge of protecting human rights mostly monitor and investigate violations, but they cannot force states to, say,\nchange a policy or compensate a victim. That's why some critics say it's naive\nto consider human rights a given in a world where state interests \nwield so much power. Critics also question the universality\nof human rights and emphasize that their development has been heavily guided by a small number\nof mostly Western nations to the detriment of inclusiveness. The result? A general bias in favor \nof civil policital liberties over sociopolitical rights and of individual \nover collective or groups rights. Others defend universal human rights laws and point at the positive role they have\non setting international standards and helping activists in their campaigns. They also point out that not all international \nhuman rights instruments are powerless. For example, the European Convention\non Human Rights establishes a court where the 47 member countries\nand their citizens can bring cases. The court issues binding decisions\nthat each member state must comply with. Human rights law is constantly evolving as are our views and definitions of what\nthe basic human rights should be. For example, how basic or important\nis the right to democracy or to development? And as our lives are increasingly digital, should there be a right \nto access the Internet? A right to digital privacy? What do you think? "

        "text": "In 1901, David Hänig published a paper that forever changed \nour understanding of taste. His research led to what we know \ntoday as the taste map: an illustration that divides the tongue \ninto four separate areas. According to this map, receptors at the tip of our tongues\ncapture sweetness, bitterness \nis detected at the tongue’s base, and along the sides, receptors capture \nsalty and sour sensations. Since its invention, the taste map \nhas been published in textbooks and newspapers. The only problem with this map, \nis that it’s wrong. In fact, it’s not even \nan accurate representation of what Hänig originally discovered. The tongue map is a common misconception— something widely believed \nbut largely incorrect. So where do misconceptions \nlike this come from, and what makes a fake fact \nso easy to believe? It’s true that the tongue map’s \njourney begins with David Hänig. As part of his dissertation \nat Leipzig University, Hänig analyzed taste sensitivities across \nthe tongue for the four basic flavors. Using sucrose for sweet, \nquinine sulfate for bitter, hydrochloric acid for sour, \nand salt for salty, Hänig applied these stimuli to compare \ndifferences in taste thresholds across a subject’s tongue. He hoped to better understand \nthe physiological mechanisms that affected these four flavors, and his data suggested that sensitivity \nfor each taste did in fact vary across the tongue. The maximum sensation for sweet \nwas located at the tongue’s tip; bitter flavors were strongest at the back;\nsalt was strongest in this area, and sour at the middle \nof the tongue’s sides. But Hänig was careful \nto note that every sensation could also be tasted across the tongue, and that the areas he identified offered \nvery small variations in intensity. Like so many misconceptions, the tongue map represents a distortion \nof its original source, however the nature of that distortion \ncan vary. Some misconceptions \nare comprised of disinformation— false information intentionally designed \nto mislead people. But many misconceptions, \nincluding the tongue map, center on misinformation—\nfalse or misleading information that results from unintentional \ninaccuracy. Misinformation is most often shaped \nby mistakes and human error, but the specific mistakes \nthat lead to a misconception can be surprisingly varied. In the case of the tongue map, Hänig’s dissertation was written \nin German, meaning the paper could only be \nunderstood by readers fluent in German and well versed in Hanig’s \nsmall corner of academia. This kicked off a game of telephone \nthat re-shaped Häing’s research every time it was shared \nwith outside parties. Less than a decade after his dissertation, newspapers were falsely insisting \nthat experiments could prove sweetness was imperceptible \non the back of the tongue. The second culprit \nbehind the tongue map’s spread were the images \nthat Hänig’s work inspired. In 1912, a rough version of the map \nappeared in a newspaper article that cautiously described \nsome of the mysteries behind taste and smell research. Featuring clear labels across the tongue,\nthe article’s illustration simplified Hänig’s more-complicated \noriginal diagrams. Variations of this approachable image \nbecame repeatedly cited, often without credit or nuanced \nconsideration for Hänig’s work. Eventually this image spread \nto textbooks and classrooms as a purported truth \nof how we experience taste. But perhaps the factor that most \ncontributed to this misconception was its narrative simplicity. In many ways, the map complements our desire for clear \nstories about the world around us— a quality not always present \nin the sometimes-messy fields of science. For example, even the number of tastes we have is more \ncomplicated than Hänig’s work suggests. Umami— also known as savory— \nis now considered the fifth basic taste, and many still debate \nthe existence of tastes like fatty, alkaline, metallic, \nand water-like. Once we hear a good story, it can be difficult to change \nhow we see that information, even in the face of new evidence. So, next time you see a convenient chart \nor read a surprising anecdote, try to maintain a healthy skepticism— because misconceptions \ncan leave a bitter taste on every part of your tongue. "

        "text": "Many of us have hundreds of things\non our minds at any moment, often struggling to keep track\nof everything we need to do. But fortunately, there's one important thing\nwe don't have to worry about remembering: breathing. When you breathe, you transport oxygen\nto the body's cells to keep them working and clear your system \nof the carbon dioxide that this work generates. Breathing, in other words,\nkeeps the body alive. So, how do we accomplish \nthis crucial and complex task without even thinking about it? The answer lies \nin our body's respiratory system. Like any machinery,\nit consists of specialized components, and requires a trigger \nto start functioning. Here, the components are the structures \nand tissues making up the lungs, as well as the various other \nrespiratory organs connected to them. And to get this machine moving,\nwe need the autonomic nervous system, our brain's unconscious control center\nfor the vital functions. As the body prepares \nto take in oxygen-rich air, this system sends a signal \nto the muscles around your lungs, flattening the diaphragm and contracting the intercostal muscles \nbetween your ribs to create more space \nfor the lungs to expand. Air then wooshes into your nose and mouth, through your trachea, and into the bronchi\nthat split at the trachea's base, with one entering each lung. Like tree branches, these small tubes \ndivide into thousands of tinier passages called bronchioles. It's tempting to think of the lungs \nas huge balloons, but instead of being hollow,\nthey're actually spongy inside, with the bronchioles running \nthroughout the parenchyma tissue. At the end of each bronchiole \nis a little air sack called an alveolus, wrapped in capillaries \nfull of red blood cells containing special proteins \ncalled hemoglobin. The air you've breathed in\nfills these sacks, causing the lungs to inflate. Here is where the vital exchange occurs. At this point, the capillaries\nare packed with carbon dioxide, and the air sacks are full of oxygen. But due to the basic process of diffusion, the molecules of each gas \nwant to move to a place where there's a lower concentration \nof their kind. So as oxygen crosses over \nto the capillaries, the hemoglobin grabs it up, while the carbon dioxide \nis unloaded into the lungs. The oxygen-rich hemoglobin \nis then transported throughout the body via the bloodstream. But what do our lungs do \nwith all that carbon dioxide? Exhale it, of course. The autonomic nervous system \nkicks in again, causing the diaphragm to ball up, and the intercostal muscles to relax, making the chest cavities smaller\nand forcing the lungs to compress. The carbon dioxide-rich air is expelled,\nand the cycle begins again. So that's how these spongy organs keep\nour bodies efficiently supplied with air. Lungs inhale and exhale \nbetween 15 and 25 times a minute, which amounts to an incredible \n10,000 liters of air each day. That's a lot of work, but don't sweat it. Your lungs and \nyour autonomic nervous system have got it covered. "

        "text": "In the 8th century CE, \nVikings surged across the misty seas. They came from Scandinavia \nin Northern Europe but would travel far and wide. Some plundered and settled \nin the British Isles and France; others braved Artic exploration or forged clever new trade routes \nto the Middle East. With their steely navigational skills, \nadvanced long-ships and fearsome tactics, the Vikings sustained their seafaring \nfor over three hundred years. But for all their might, \nthey left few monuments. Instead, fragments of stone, \nbark, and bone provide the keys to their culture. Found in graves, bogs, \nand sites of ancient settlements, many of these objects are inscribed with messages in Old Norse \nwritten in runic letters. But the Vikings also scratched runes\ninto household goods, jewellery, weapons, and even shoes. Deciphering these messages \nis no easy task. Runes are short, straight, \nand diagonal lines that make up an alphabet \ncalled the “futhark.” All classes of people spoke and wrote \nthis language, in many different dialects. There was no standard spelling, \nthey wrote the individual runic letters by pronouncing the sounds \nof their regional accents. Some of these inscriptions also bore \nthe influence of other cultures the Vikings interacted with— the runic inscription “love conquers all,”\nfor example, is originally a Latin phrase \nfrom the poet Virgil. Many, like the enigmatic Rok runestone, \nwere carved in verse, highlighting the tradition \nof Old Norse poetry. So even though modern runologists \ncan read runes, their meaning isn’t always obvious. Still, in spite of the remaining \nmysteries, many inscriptions memorializing the dead and recording local histories \nhave been deciphered— along with some \ncontaining magical incantations. The Ramsund runes in Sweden are carved \non a rocky outcrop beside a bridge for travelers passing over swampy ground. This causeway was commissioned \nby a prominent local woman named Sigríðr. She proclaimed both her importance \nand her family’s power by carving their names in stone, and even associated herself \nand her family with mythical heroism by carving illustrations of Sigurd \nthe dragon slayer. In the town of Jelling in Denmark, two standing stones from the 10th century memorialize different generations\nof a royal family. The first was erected by King Gorm the Old\nin memory of his Queen Thyrvi, and the second by their son, \nHarald Bluetooth, after Gorm’s death. The stones announce the power \nof this Viking Age dynasty, and they are among the earliest historical\ndocuments of Denmark. They indicate that Denmark \nwas the earliest major Viking Age kingdom, by telling that Harald controlled \nsouthern Norway, and that he converted to Christianity. Today, Harald Bluetooth’s initials \nmake up the Bluetooth logo. The 10th century warrior poet Egil \nwas a well-known carver of runes. According to poetic accounts, he once \ncarved runes on a horn filled with poison, causing the horn to shatter. In another story, Egil saves a young girl’s life \nby placing a piece of whale bone carved with healing runes \nunder her pillow. Norse poetry tells of runic spells, \ncast to ensure calm seas, safe childbirth and triumphant battles. But the exact nature of these spells \nisn’t fully understood— many of the inscriptions on swords,\naxes, and spears are indecipherable. Other objects, like the Lindholm amulet, have inscriptions that could be \nincantations, riddles, or religious messages. While it’s difficult to pinpoint the end\nof the Viking era, by 1100 CE their sea-borne expansion \nhad mostly come to an end. However, people continued to speak \nversions of Old Norse throughout Scandinavia; and runes remained in use in rural areas\ninto the 19th century. Today, many runestones remain standing \nat their original sites. The inscription on the Danish Glavendrup\nstone has fearsomely declared \nfor a thousand years: “A warlock be he who damages this stone\nor drags it in memory of another!” "

We're visiting ancient Rome\nto watch the Liberalia, an annual festival that celebrates\nthe liberty of Rome's citizens. We're looking in at a 17-year-old\nnamed Lucius Popidius Secundus. He's not from a poor family, but he lives\nin the region known as the Subura, a poorer neighborhood in Rome,\nyet close to the center of the city. (Gong) The tenants of these\napartments are crammed in, (Grunting) which poses considerable risk. Fires are frequent and the smell of ash\nand smoke in the morning is not uncommon. Lucius, who awoke at dawn,\nhas family duties to perform today. (Cheering) His 15-year-old brother is coming of age. Half the children in ancient Rome\ndie before they reach adulthood, so this is a particularly\nimportant milestone. Lucius watches his brother\nstand in his new toga before the household shrine\nwith its protective deities, as he places his bulla,\na protective amulet, in the shrine with a prayer of thanks. The bulla had worked.\nIt had protected him. Unlike many others,\nhe had survived to become an adult. At 17, Lucius has almost\ncompleted his education. He has learned to speak well,\nmake public speeches, and how to read and write\nboth Latin and Greek. His father has taught him\nthe types of things you can't learn in the classroom: how to run, how to swim, and how to fight. Lucius could choose, at 17,\nto become a military tribune and command soldiers\non the edge of the Empire. But in other ways,\nLucius is still a child. He's not trusted\nto arrange business deals. His father will take care\nof that until he is 25. And Dad will arrange Lucius' marriage\nto a girl 10 years younger. His dad has his eye on a family\nwith a 7-year-old daughter. Back to the Liberalia. As Lucius leaves with his family, the shops are open as the population\ngoes about its business. The streets are full\nof itinerant traders selling trinkets and people bustling from place to place. Large wagons are not allowed\nin the city until after the ninth hour but the streets are still crowded. Fathers and uncles\ntake the kids to the Forum Augustus to see statues of Rome's famous warriors like Aeneas, who led Rome's ancestors,\nthe Trojans, to Italy. And Romulus, Rome's founder. And all the great generals of the Republic\nfrom more than 100 years earlier. Lovingly, we can imagine\nfathers and guardians with their now adult children remembering stories of Rome's glory and re-telling the good deeds and sayings\nof the great men of the past: lessons on how to live well, and to overcome the follies of youth. There is a sense of history in this place,\nrelevant to their present. Romans made an empire\nwithout end in time and space. (Thump) Rome was destined to be\neternal through warfare. Wars were a fact of life, even in A.D. 73. There are campaigns in the north\nof England and into Scotland, to the north of the River\nDanube into Romania, and on the frontier\nbetween Syria and Iraq to the east. It's now the eighth hour --\ntime to head for the baths. Lucius and his family head up\nthe Via Lata, the wide street, to the Campus Martius,\nand the enormous Baths of Agrippa. The family members leave\nthe clients and freedmen outside, and enter the baths with their peer group. Baths would change from dark,\nsteamy rooms to light ones. The Romans had perfected window glass. Everyone moves from the cold room to the tepid room and to the very hot room. (Man) Oops! More than an hour later, the bathers leave massaged, oiled, (Whistling) and have been scraped down with a strigil to remove the remaining dirt. At the ninth hour, seven hours\nafter they left home, the men return for a celebratory dinner. Dinner is an intimate affair, with nine people\nreclining around the low table. Slaves attend to their every need if the diners, through gestures,\ndemand more food and wine. As the day closes, we can hear\nthe rumble of wagons outside. The clients and freedmen, with a meal of robust\n-- if inferior -- food inside them, shuffle off to the now tepid baths before returning\nto their apartment blocks. Back at Lucius' house,\nthe drinking continues into the night. Lucius and his stepbrother\ndon't look too well. A slave stands by in case\neither of them needs to vomit. With hindsight, we know Lucius' future. In 20 years' time, the Emperor Vespasian's\nyoungest son, Domitian, as emperor, will enact a reign of terror. Will Lucius survive? (Drums) "

        "text": "A mountain separating two lakes. A room papered \nfloor to ceiling with bridal satins. The lid of an immense snuffbox. These seemingly unrelated images \ntake us on a tour of a sperm whale’s head in Herman Melville’s \"Moby Dick.\" On the surface, the book is the story of Captain Ahab’s \nhunt for revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale who bit off his leg. But though the book features pirates,\ntyphoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you shouldn’t expect a conventional \nseafaring adventure. Instead, it’s a multilayered exploration \nof not only the intimate details of life aboard a whaling ship, but also subjects from across \nhuman and natural history, by turns playful and tragic, \nhumorous, and urgent. The narrator guiding us through \nthese explorations is a common sailor called Ishmael. Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp \nand drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea. But after he befriends \nthe Pacific Islander Queequeg and joins Ahab’s crew aboard the Pequod, Ishmael becomes more \nof an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional character. While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck \ntries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us \non his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, \nnot excluding its suburbs.” In his telling, life’s biggest questions \nloom large, even in the smallest details. Like his narrator, Melville \nwas a restless and curious spirit, who gained an unorthodox education\nworking as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages \naround the world in his youth. He published \"Moby Dick\" in 1851, when the United States’ \nwhaling industry was at its height. Nantucket, where the Pequod sets sail, was the epicenter of this lucrative \nand bloody global industry which decimated the world’s \nwhale populations. Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away \nfrom the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whale’s perspective \nat one point, when he speculates on how terrifying \nthe huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below. The author’s first-hand familiarity \nwith whaling is evident over and over again\nin Ishmael’s vivid descriptions. In one chapter, \nthe skin of a whale’s penis becomes protective clothing \nfor a crewman. Chapters with titles as unpromising \nas “Cistern and Buckets” become some of the novel’s \nmost rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out \na sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato. Tangling whale-lines provoke \nwitty reflections on the “ever-present perils” \nentangling all mortals. He draws on diverse branches of knowledge,\nlike zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and teachings from a range \nof religious and cultural traditions. The book experiments with writing style \nas much as subject matter. In one monologue, Ahab challenges \nMoby Dick in Shakespearean style: “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying \nbut unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; \nfrom hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit \nmy last breath at thee.” One chapter is written as a playscript, where members of the Pequod’s multi-ethnic\ncrew chime in individually and in chorus. African and Spanish sailors trade insults \nwhile a Tahitian seaman longs for home, Chinese and Portuguese crewmembers \ncall for a dance, and one young boy prophesies disaster. In another chapter, Ishmael sings the process \nof decanting whale oil in epic style, as the ship pitches and rolls \nin the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landslides. A book so wide-ranging \nhas something for everyone. Readers have found \nreligious and political allegory, existential enquiry, \nsocial satire, economic analysis, and representations \nof American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict. As Ishmael chases meaning \nand Ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces \nof optimism and uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterize \nhuman existence no matter what it is we’re chasing. Through \"Moby Dick’s\" many pages, Melville invites his readers \nto leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt \nfor the “ungraspable phantom of life.” "

        "text": "66 million years ago,\nnear what’s now the Yucatán Peninsula, a juvenile sauropod feasted\non horsetail plants on a riverbank. Earth was a tropical planet. Behemoth and tiny dinosaurs alike\nroamed its lands, while reptiles and tentacled ammonites\nswept its seas. But, in an instant,\neverything would change. A roughly 12-kilometer-wide asteroid\nwas careening toward Earth at around 20 kilometers per second. From where the sauropod stood, there would have been\nno early warning signs. The asteroid barreled through Earth's\natmosphere in a matter of seconds and struck the Yucatán’s\nsubmerged continental shelf. It exploded upon impact, instantaneously creating\na 100-kilometer-wide hole and ejecting sedimentary\nand crystalline rocks. Within minutes, the impact crater,\nknown today as Chicxulub, began collapsing inwards. Meanwhile, the base rebounded some\n20 kilometers above the Earth’s surface, then fell back down and moved outwards,\ncreating a ring of mountains. The energy released from the asteroid’s\nimpact is estimated to have been several billion times that\nof a nuclear bomb. The force sent seismic energy\nacross the planet at a much greater magnitude\nthan any earthquake a tectonic fault could ever produce. Massive landslides ensued. And a tsunami sped\nfrom the newly formed crater, potentially reaching 1,500 meters high. Countless lives were extinguished. Some instantly: all life\nwithin 1,500 kilometers of the impact site was incinerated; others right after: by colossal waves,\nlandslides, and hurricane force winds. But many organisms\nacross the planet survived. It was what came next that would bring\nabout the end for many species, including almost all dinosaurs. This was just the beginning of one\nof the most devastating periods in the history of life on Earth. When the asteroid struck,\nit sent hundreds of gigatons of carbon-dioxide-rich limestone\nand sulfur-saturated-sediments into the atmosphere. The sulfur combined with water vapor\nto create sulfate aerosols. This plume of limestone dust,\nsoot, and sulfate aerosols spread from the impact site\nat several kilometers per second, blanketing the globe in a matter of hours. It’s thought to have blocked the Sun, plunging Earth into an extended period\nof darkness and dropping the temperature\nin many places by at least 25°C. The asteroid’s immediate\nimpact was devastating, but it seems to have been\nthe rapid climate change it triggered that ended the roughly 165-million-year\nreign of the dinosaurs. Plants and plankton rapidly died, causing the collapse\nof food webs worldwide. An estimated 75% of life on Earth\nwent extinct, including almost all dinosaurs. Small birds were the only\nkinds that remained, perhaps because they relied on hardy seeds\nthat weathered the catastrophe. It's unclear why exactly the lifeforms\nthat survived the extinction did. Many smaller organisms,\nlike insects, persisted. So did early mammals— perhaps because\nof their ability to burrow and hibernate. And photosynthetic lifeforms like algae, that had ways of withstanding\nlow-light conditions, also survived. Traces of the asteroid scattered worldwide\nand the scar of the Chicxulub crater attest to this period\nof monumental destruction. So, what are the chances of another\nChicxulub happening? Space programs are continuously\nidentifying and tracking near-Earth asteroids. Fortunately, the likelihood of one\nas large and cataclysmic striking in the next thousand or so years\nseems to be small— something like a 7 in a million chance. However, we are facing the consequences\nof another kind of rapid climate change, this time because of humanity's\nown emissions. Animals are going extinct faster\nthan ever in our history, and people are being displaced\nfrom their homes. But, unlike the dinosaurs, we have the opportunity to avoid the\nlarge-scale devastation that will come if governments continue\nwith the status quo. "

        "text": "When President Ronald Reagan began\nhis first term in 1981, the US economy was struggling. Unemployment rates were high\nand getting higher, and in 1979, inflation had peaked \nat an all-time high for peacetime. In an effort to combat these issues, Reagan's administration introduced\na number of economic policies, including tax cuts for large corporations\nand high-income earners. The idea was that tax savings for the rich would cause extra money \nto trickle down to everyone else, and for that reason, these policies are often referred \nto as trickle-down economics. From the 80s to the late 90s, the US saw one of its longest \nand strongest periods of economic growth in history. Median income rose, \nas did rates of job creation. Since then, many politicians have invoked\ntrickle-down theory as a justification for tax cuts— but did these policies actually work, either in the sense of stimulating \neconomic growth, or in terms of improving circumstances\nfor Americans? Would they work in other circumstances? To answer these questions, the main things to consider are whether\nthe impact of the tax cut on the government’s tax revenue \nis harmful, whether the money saved in taxes actually\nstimulates the economy, and whether stimulating the economy\nactually improves people’s lives. The idea behind tax cuts is \nthat if taxes are too high, people will be less willing to work, which would ultimately\ndecrease tax revenue. So at a lower tax rate, the government\nmight actually gain more tax money that it can theoretically put \ntowards improving life for its citizens, because people will work more when they\nget to keep more of their earnings. Of course, there’s a limit to how much\nthe government can cut taxes: at a zero tax rate there is no tax revenue\nregardless of how much people are working. So while cuts from a very high\ntax rate might be fine, cuts from a lower tax rate might\nbe counterproductive, hampering the government's ability\nto accomplish crucial things. Tax rates were extremely high\nwhen Reagan took office. His administration cut the highest income\ntax bracket from 70% to 28% and corporation tax from 48% to 34%. By comparison, as of early 2021, those rates were 37% and 21% respectively. When tax rates are lower, tax cuts\nfor the wealthy can be harmful. For example, in 2012 to 2013, lawmakers cut the top tax-rate in the\nstate of Kansas by almost 30% and reduced some business\ntax rates to zero. As a result, the government’s balance\nsheet immediately fell into negative territory \nand did not recover, implying that wealthy individuals \nand companies did not invest back into the economy. In short, the money did not trickle down. This appears to be a trend: in a study over multiple periods \nof history and across 18 countries, The London School of Economics \nfound that cutting taxes increased the wealth\nof the top 1% of people, but had little effect \non the economy as a whole. In order for tax cuts for the rich\nto truly stimulate the economy, they would have to spend the saved money putting it back into, for example, \nlocal businesses— but this isn’t what happens in practice. No economic policy operates in isolation: each time and place is unique with\nmultiple policies in place simultaneously, so there is only ever one test case\nfor each set of scenarios. This makes it difficult to deliver\ndefinitive rulings on whether an economic policy worked, whether something else might\nhave worked better, or whether it would work \nin a different situation. And yet, rhetoric \naround trickle-down economics, both during the Reagan era and since, often promises something definitive: that spending by society’s richest members\non things other than taxes directly improves the financial \ncircumstances of the less wealthy. And there’s not\nmuch evidence to support that. "

        "text": "The distinct forms of speech heard around Bremen, Germany \nand Interlaken, Switzerland are considered regional dialects \nof the German language. And yet, when someone from Bremen \nis visiting the Swiss Alps, the conversations they hear between locals\nwill likely be incomprehensible to them. Similarly, outside of China, Mandarin and Cantonese are often referred\nto as Chinese dialects. But they’re even more dissimilar\nthan Spanish and Italian. On the other hand, speakers of Danish,\nNorwegian, and Swedish, which are recognized as three\ndistinct languages, can usually communicate in their native\ntongues with little difficulty. And Turkish language soap operas,\nbroadcast without dubbing or subtitles, are some of the most popular\nshows in Azeri-speaking Azerbaijan. So, when is a form of speech considered\na dialect versus a language? It seems reasonable that the degree \nof mutual intelligibility would determine whether two ways of speaking are\nclassified as separate languages or as dialects of the same language. But as we've seen, there are many\noccasions where this is not the case. Perhaps surprisingly, the distinction\nbetween a language and a dialect usually has nothing to do \nwith pronunciation, vocabulary, or any other linguistic features. However, it’s not coincidental, either. It’s a matter of politics. The basis for what’s officially deemed\na language was shaped by the emergence of a European \nnation states beginning around the 1500s. In order to establish and maintain \ncentralized governments, clear territorial boundaries, \nand state-sponsored education systems, many nation states promoted\na standardized language. Which form of speech was chosen \nto be the standard language was usually based on what people spoke \nin the capital. And while other forms of speech persisted,\nthey were often treated as inferior. This tradition extended across the globe \nwith European colonization and into modern times. Italy, for example, has at least 15 \nof what might be called regional dialects. One of them, the Florentine dialect, became known as Standard Italian when \nthe country politically unified in 1861. It was selected because legendary authors \nlike Dante and Machiavelli used it in their original works, And it came to represent an image \nof Italian national identity that some found particularly desirable. Later on, in his attempt to establish \na unified, fascist state, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini \nsaw language standardization as an important objective. His government promoted standard Italian\nwhile prohibiting other forms of speech from the public sphere, framing them as backward \nand unsophisticated. In everything from job applications\nto court testimonies, standard languages act as gatekeepers\naround the world. For instance, one 1999 study showed that\nlandlords responded to apartment inquiries based on what form of speech\ntheir prospective tenants used. When callers spoke African-American\nVernacular English, or AAVE, landlords were more likely \nto reject their inquiries. When they spoke so-called \nStandard American English, which is often associated with whiteness, landlords responded more positively. Both of these forms of speech are\nconsidered English dialects. In the United States, \nsome people have cast AAVE as an incorrect or simplified version \nof mainstream US English. But AAVE follows consistent \ngrammatical rules every bit as sophisticated \nas other forms of English. Linguists tend to avoid \nthe term dialect altogether. Instead, many opt to call different forms\nof speech “varieties.” This way, languages are seen \nas groups of varieties. So the English language \nis made up of varieties including Standard British \nand American English, AAVE, Nigerian English, Malaysian English,\nand many others. Each has its own unique history \nand characteristic pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammatical structures. But the dividing line \nbetween varieties is murky. Human language, in all its\ncross-pollinating, ever-evolving glory, naturally resists the impulse \nto sort it into neat buckets. Oftentimes, forms of speech exist \non a kind of linguistic continuum where they overlap with others, and the differences between them \nare gradual— not clear cut. And that’s the confounding\nbeauty of the dynamic, diverse, and dazzling universe \nof human communication. "

        "text": "Since the dawn of humanity, an estimated 100.8 billion\npeople have lived and died, a number that increases by about\n.8% of the world's population each year. What happens to all \nof those people's bodies after they die and will the planet eventually\nrun out of burial space? When a person's heart stops beating, the body passes through several\nstages before it begins decomposing. Within minutes after death, the blood begins settling in\nthe lower-most parts of the body. Usually eight to twelve hours later, the skin in those areas is discolored\nby livor mortis, or post-mortem stain. And while at the moment of death\nthe body's muscles relax completely in a condition called primary flaccidity, they stiffen about two to six hours later\nin what's known as rigor mortis. This stiffening spreads \nthrough the muscles, and its speed can be affected by age,\ngender, and the surrounding environment. The body also changes temperature, usually cooling off \nto match its environment. Next comes decomposition, the process by which bacteria and insects\nbreak apart the body. Many factors affect \nthe rate of decomposition. There is, however, a basic guide of the\neffect of the environment on decompositon called Casper's Law. It says that if all other \nfactors are equal, a body exposed to air decomposes twice\nas fast as one immersed in water and eight times as fast \nas one buried in earth. Soil acidity also greatly \naffects bone preservation. High-acidity soils with \na pH of less than 5.3 will rapidly decompose bone, whereas in a neutral or basic soil\nwith a pH of 7 or more, a skeleton can remain in relatively\ngood condition for centuries. Different cultures throughout history have\ndeveloped unique approaches to burials. As far back as \nthe first Neanderthal burials, death was accompanied by rituals, like the positioning, coloring,\nor decorating of corpses. Traditional Christian burials decorate\nthe body in dress, while in traditional Islam, a body is wrapped in a piece \nof ritual fabric with the face oriented toward Mecca. Traditional Hindus ceremonially burn\nthe body, and Zoroastrians, followers of one of the\noldest monotheistic religions, traditionally place bodies atop a tower\nto expose them to the Sun and scavenging birds.` Before the Industrial Revolution,\nburials were simple and accessible. These days, with suitable burial land\nrunning out in high-population areas, purchasing private gravesites\ncan be costly, and many people can't afford\nsimple burials. Even cremation, the second most common\nburial practice in the world, comes with a high cost. As for the question \nof running out of space, the issue isn't so much about total land\nin the world as it is that large populations cluster\ntogether within cities. Most of the big cities in the world may run out of suitable burial grounds\nwithin a century. For London, it's even sooner. That may happen by 2035. So are there alternatives\nto traditional burials that might help with the space issue? In some countries, skyscraper cemeteries\nenable vertical burials. Some options focus on the body's\nrelationship with the environment. Promession, for example, freeze-dries\nand pulverizes the body, creating a powder \nthat can turn into compost when mixed with oxygen and water. There are also green burials that use\nspecial materials, such as biodegradable caskets, urns that sprout trees, and burial suits that grow mushrooms. Eternal reefs take that concept\nto the depths of the ocean using a mixture of ashes and cement\nto create marine habitats for sea life. Death is an inevitable part\nof the human condition, but how we treat bodies and burials\ncontinues to evolve. We may each have different spiritual, religious, or practical approaches to dying, but the ever-increasing demand\nfor burial space might give us a push to be creative about where our bodies go\nafter the final stages of life.

        "text": "Nearly three millennia ago, a Babylonian tablet described \na curious illness called miqtu. Said to cause symptoms ranging from \nfacial twitching to full body convulsions, the Babylonians believed those afflicted\nwere possessed by evil spirits, and the only treatment was\ndivine intervention. Today, we know the symptoms\nof miqtu by another name, and modern medicine has developed\nnumerous treatments for those experiencing seizures. But these ancient afflictions still hold\na surprising number of secrets. Doctors define a seizure \nas any set of symptoms resulting from excess \nelectrical activity in the brain. Outside this shared feature, there is a \nmassive range of seizure symptoms, and researchers have identified a variety\nof different seizure types. But regardless of the underlying\nconditions that cause them, every seizure begins here. Hippocrates identified the brain \nas the source of seizures around 400 BCE. However, this insight didn't immediately\nlead to better treatments. Generally, ancient Greeks prescribed\nmedicinal herbs and alterations in diet. If they believed the seizure was caused \nby bleeding in the skull, they sometimes employed\na technique called trepanation. This early surgery involved drilling \na hole in the skull to let blood escape and relieve pressure on the brain. Trepanation had... sizable risks. But it wasn’t until the 19th century\nthat scientists would make the next leap forward \nin seizure treatment. In 1870, two German researchers discovered\nthat using electricity to stimulate specific areas of a dog’s \nbrain could move parts of its body. Around the same time, other scientists\ndiscovered the brain and nervous system were connected via a network of cells \ncalled neurons that transmitted electrical signals \nthroughout the body. This established the brain \nas the control center for nerve impulses that determine our thoughts and movement. Better yet, this model made it clear \nthat seizures were due to errors in that control center, such as misfiring neurons\nor excess electrical activity. Early experiments even suggested \nthat different patterns of misfiring could account for different \nseizure types and symptoms. So if seizures were due\nto neurons misfiring, how could doctors stop\nthis from happening? Physicians like Sir Charles Locock\nhypothesized that sedative drugs might calm overactive brain activity, a theory he confirmed by treating seizures with a medication called \npotassium bromide. Others like Sir Victor Horsley suspected that removing damaged parts of\nthe brain might stop a patient's seizures. In 1886, he performed a craniotomy, temporarily removing part of a patient's\nskull to extract scarred brain tissue. Not only did his patient survive,\nbut his seizures improved, launching further research \nin surgical treatments. Over the next two centuries, \nseizure treatments advanced rapidly. And today, there are dozens of available\nseizure medications that work with unprecedented specificity. Some newer medications are able \nto focus on specific proteins in the neuron to help manage\nelectrical activity. And advanced brain imaging techniques can\nsometimes allow doctors to pinpoint exactly what parts of the brain are\ncausing an individual's seizures. Surgeons then use this information\nto perform targeted surgeries. These various treatments help doctors\nmanage the majority of seizure cases, allowing most people with seizures \nto live healthy and comfortable lives. But the underlying pathology \nof many seizures remains elusive. In cases without clear brain damage or \ncertain types of pre-existing conditions, it's incredibly difficult to determine\nwhat causes neurons to misfire. It's also not always clear why some\ntreatments are effective. And even more mysterious are cases where\nseizures are resistant to existing treatments that work \non similar seizure types. Scientists are still working\non these questions, but there are clear answers for what to do if you encounter someone\nexperiencing a seizure. You should never hold \na seizing person down, put objects in their mouth, \nor perform CPR. Instead, try to keep the person safe\nfrom falling or bumping their head, shift them onto their side\nto keep airways open, and stay with them until\nmedical help arrives. "

        "text": "After a three-hour concert by her\nfavorite Norwegian metal band, Anja finds it difficult to hear \nher friend rave about the show. It sounds like he's speaking\nfrom across the room, and it’s tough to make out his muted voice\nover the ringing in her ears. By the next morning, \nthe effect has mostly worn off, but Anja still has questions. What caused the symptoms? \nIs her hearing going to fully recover? And can she still go to concerts\nwithout damaging her ears? To answer these questions, we first need to understand what sound is\nand how we hear it. Like a pebble creating ripples in water, sound is created when displaced molecules\nvibrate through space. While sound vibrations can travel\nthrough solids and liquids, our ears have evolved to process\nvibrations in the air. These waves of air pressure enter \nour ear canals and bounce off the eardrum. A trio of bones called the ossicular chain then carries those vibrations \ninto the cochlea, transforming waves of air pressure\ninto waves of cochlear fluid. Here, our perception of sound\nbegins to take form. The waves of fluid move\nthe basilar membrane, a tissue lined with tens of thousands\nof hair cells. The specific vibration of these hair cells\nand the stereocilia on top of each one determine the auditory signal \nour brain perceives. Unfortunately, these essential cells\nare also quite vulnerable. There are two properties of sound \nthat can damage these cells. The first is volume. The louder a sound is, the greater\nthe pressure of its vibrations. While the ear’s upper limits vary\nfrom person to person, close range exposure to sound\nexceeding 120 decibels can instantly bend or blow out hair cells,\nresulting in permanent hearing damage. The pressure of more powerful sounds \ncan even dislocate the ossicular chain or burst an eardrum. The other side of this equation \nis the sound’s duration. While dangerously loud sounds \ncan injure ears almost instantly, hair cells can also be damaged by exposure to lower sound pressure \nfor long periods. For example, hearing a hand dryer is safe \nfor the 20 seconds you’re using it. But if you listened \nfor 8 consecutive hours, this relatively low-pressure sound \nwould overwork the stereocilia and swell the hair cell’s \nsupporting tissue. Swollen hair cells are unable to vibrate \nwith the appropriate speed and accuracy, making hearing muffled. This kind of hearing loss is known\nas a temporary threshold shift, and many people will experience \nit at least once in their lifetime. In Anja’s case, \nthe loud sounds of the concert only took three hours\nto cause this condition. Fortunately, it's a temporary ailment\nthat usually resolves as swelling decreases over time. In most cases, simply avoiding hazardous sounds \ngives hair cells all they need to recover. One temporary threshold shift isn’t likely\nto cause permanent hearing loss. But frequent exposure \nto dangerous sound levels can lead to a wide range \nof hearing disorders, such as the constant buzz of tinnitus or difficulty understanding speech\nin loud environments. Overworked hair cells can also generate\ndangerous molecules called reactive oxygen species. These molecules\nhave unpaired electrons, driving them to steal electrons\nfrom nearby cells and cause permanent damage\nto the inner ear. There are numerous strategies you can\nadopt for preventing hearing loss. Current research around earbud headphone\nuse suggests keeping your volume at 80% or less if you’ll be listening for \nmore than 90 minutes throughout the day. Noise-isolating headphones can also help \nyou listen at lower volumes. Getting a baseline understanding \nof your hearing is essential to protecting \nyour auditory system. Just like our eyes and teeth,\nour ears also need annual check-ups. Not all communities have\naccess to audiologists, but organizations around the world are\ndeveloping portable hearing tests and easy-to-use apps to bring these\nvital resources to remote regions. Finally, wear earplugs\nwhen you’re knowingly exposing yourself to loud sounds for extended periods. An earplug’s effectiveness depends \non how well you’ve inserted it, so be careful to read the instructions. But when worn correctly, they can ensure you'll be able\nto hear your favorite band for many nights to come. "

        "text": "What would you say is the most important discovery made in the past few centuries? Is it the computer? The car? Electricity? Or maybe the discovery of the atom? I would argue that it is this chemical reaction: a nitrogen gas molecule plus three hydrogen gas molecules gets you two ammonia gas molecules. This is the Haber process of binding nitrogen molecules in the air to hydrogen molecules, or turning air into fertilizer. Without this reaction, farmers would be capable of producing enough food for only 4 billion people; our current population is just over 7 billion people. So, without the Haber process, over 3 billion people would be without food. You see, nitrogen in the form of nitrate, NO3, is an essential nutrient for plants to survive. As crops grow, they consume the nitrogen, removing it from the soil. The nitrogen can be replenished through long, natural fertilization processes like decaying animals, but humans want to grow food much faster than that. Now, here's the frustrating part: 78% of the air is composed of nitrogen, but crops can't just take nitrogen from the air because it contains very strong triple bonds, which crops cannot break. What Haber did basically was figure out a way to take this nitrogen in the air and put it into the ground. In 1908, the German chemist Fritz Haber developed a chemical method for utilizing the vast supply of nitrogen in the air. Haber found a method which took the nitrogen in the air and bonded it to hydrogen to form ammonia. Ammonia can then be injected into the soil, where it is quickly converted into nitrate. But if Haber's process was going to be used to feed the world, he would need to find a way to create a lot of this ammonia quickly and easily. In order to understand how Haber accomplished this feat, we need to know something about chemical equilibrium. Chemical equilibrium can be achieved when you have a reaction in a closed container. For example, let's say you put hydrogen and nitrogen into a closed container and allow them to react. In the beginning of the experiment, we have a lot of nitrogen and hydrogen, so the formation of ammonia proceeds at a high speed. But as the hydrogen and nitrogen react and get used up, the reaction slows down because there is less nitrogen and hydrogen in the container. Eventually, the ammonia molecules reach a point where they start to decompose back into the nitrogen and hydrogen. After a while, the two reactions, creating and breaking down ammonia, will reach the same speed. When these speeds are equal, we say the reaction has reached equilibrium. This might sound good, but it's not when what you want is to just create a ton of ammonia. Haber doesn't want the ammonia to break down at all, but if you simply leave the reaction in a closed container, that's what will happen. Here's where Henry Le Chatelier, a French chemist, can help. What he found was that if you take a system in equilibrium and you add something to it, like, say, nitrogen, the system will work to get back to equilibrium again. Le Chatelier also found that if you increase the amount of pressure on a system, the system tries to work to return to the pressure it had. It's like being in a crowded room. The more molecules there are, the more pressure there is. If we look back at our equation, we see that on the left-hand side, there are four molecules on the left and just two on the right. So, if we want the room to be less crowded, and therefore have less pressure, the system will start combining nitrogen and hydrogen to make the more compact ammonia molecules. Haber realized that in order to make large amounts of ammonia, he would have to create a machine that would continually add nitrogen and hydrogen while also increasing the pressure on the equilibrium system, which is exactly what he did. Today, ammonia is one of the most produced chemical compounds in the world. Roughly 131 million metric tons are produced a year, which is about 290 billion pounds of ammonia. That's about the mass of 30 million African elephants, weighing roughly 10,000 pounds each. 80% of this ammonia is used in fertilizer production, while the rest is used in industrial and household cleaners and to produce other nitrogen compounds, such as nitric acid. Recent studies have found that half of the nitrogen from these fertilizers is not assimilated by plants. Consequently, the nitrogen is found as a volatile chemical compound in the Earth's water supplies and atmosphere, severely damaging our environment. Of course, Haber did not foresee this problem when he introduced his invention. Following his pioneering vision, scientists today are looking for a new Haber process of the 21st century, which will reach the same level of aid without the dangerous consequences. "

Though they were once conquered\nby a powerful neighbor, the kings and queens of Kush would \ngo on to successfully challenge two of the most dominant empires \nin history. From 1500 to 1100 BCE, \nEgypt controlled Kush, introducing many Egyptian \ncultural and religious practices. The civilization of Kush was more than\na thousand years old at that time. Its early capital city at Kerma had\nimpressive temples, palaces, and houses, including a massive mudbrick temple\nstructure that had a chapel deep inside, reached by a long staircase at the center. Rich gold mines helped the Kushites build\na flourishing commercial network, making bronze weapons and tools \nand trading materials like incense, animal skins, ivory, and ebony wood\nfrom sub-Saharan Africa. The tide started to change for Kush\nas Egypt descended into civil war. By 750 BCE, Egypt was divided into local \nkingdoms with fluctuating alliances. The Kushite king Piankhy \nsaw an opportunity. He led his navy, \nflanked by horsemen and archers, up the Nile to the gateway city \nof Khemenu. As Piankhy’s army constructed \nsiege ramps and battle towers, the city’s ruler sent his wives \nand daughters to negotiate— not with Piankhy,\nbut with the women of his royal household, later known as kandake, who were extremely influential in military\naffairs and political succession. At the end of a long siege,\nPiankhy entered the conquered city and bitterly criticized \nthe conditions in its stables. From there, Piankhy \nand the Kushite forces conquered the Egyptian capital of Memphis. Piankhy installed his sister, Amunirdis,\nas priestess of the great god Amun, in the Egyptian city of Thebes, and left other Kushite officials there\nbefore returning to live in Kush. His successors extended control\nall the way to the Nile Delta. This was a high point \nfor the Empire of Kush: trade thrived, and they built\nmagnificent temples, palaces, and pyramid tombs\nall along the Nile. But the Assyrian army was approaching\nEgypt in its annual campaigns. When the Assyrians began to encroach\non trade routes near Jerusalem, the Kushite king Taharqo\nmoved to stop them. The Assyrians defeated him with the help\nof some rebelling Egyptian princes, and drove him out of Egypt\nin the 7th century BCE. The Kushites continued to rule \nin their homeland for nearly 1,000 years that were prosperous and innovative. They moved their capital farther\nsouth to the city of Meroe, where they built temples \nto a new god called Apedemak. They built new cities in the savannah\nsouth of the Sahara Desert, some of which contained huge\nreservoirs for water. When the Roman Empire conquered\nEgypt in 31 BCE, Kushite armies again traveled north,\nled by Queen Amanirenas. She led them to success in battle\nagainst the Romans, capturing the bronze head of a statue\nof the Roman emperor Augustus, and bringing it back to Kush. They buried it under the doorway \nof a temple in the capital, so that worshippers would step\non it as they crossed the threshold. After brokering peace with the Romans,\nKush continued to prosper. Over time, however, groups of people\ncalled the Noba raided from the west, and trade routes were disrupted \nby the rising kingdom of Aksum. Around 350 CE, the Aksumite king\nsacked Meroe, effectively bringing Kushite rule \nto an end. Since then, some have argued \nthat Kush’s history has been overlooked by generations of European and American\nscholars who promoted the idea that Egypt was part \nof the origin of Western civilization, while Kush, as an African culture,\nwas excluded. Today, there’s still much\nto learn about Kush— including a writing system \nwe haven’t deciphered fully. "

        "text": "There are currently hundreds of thousands \nof people on transplant lists, waiting for critical organs like kidneys, \nhearts, and livers that could save their lives. Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs \navailable to fill that demand. What if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized \norgans from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine \ncurrently under development. We’re not able to print complex \norgans just yet, but simpler tissues including blood\nvessels and tubes responsible for nutrient \nand waste exchange are already in our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological \ncousin of 3-D printing, a technique that deposits layers of \nmaterial on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object \none slice at a time. Instead of starting with metal, plastic, \nor ceramic, a 3-D printer for organs and \ntissues uses bioink: a printable material that \ncontains living cells. The bulk of many bioinks are water-rich \nmolecules called hydrogels. Mixed into those are \nmillions of living cells as well as various chemicals that \nencourage cells to communicate and grow. Some bioinks include a \nsingle type of cell, while others combine several different \nkinds to produce more complex structures. Let’s say you want to print a meniscus, which is a piece of cartilage in the knee that keeps the shinbone and thighbone \nfrom grinding against each other. It’s made up of cells called chondrocytes, and you’ll need a healthy supply of \nthem for your bioink. These cells can come from donors whose\ncell lines are replicated in a lab. Or they might originate from a \npatient’s own tissue to create a personalized meniscus less\nlikely to be rejected by their body. There are several printing techniques, and the most popular is extrusion-based \nbioprinting. In this, bioink gets loaded into a \nprinting chamber and pushed through a round nozzle \nattached to a printhead. It emerges from a nozzle that’s rarely \nwider than 400 microns in diameter, and can produce a continuous filament roughly the thickness \nof a human fingernail. A computerized image or file guides the \nplacement of the strands, either onto a flat surface or into a \nliquid bath that’ll help hold the structure in place \nuntil it stabilizes. These printers are fast, producing the \nmeniscus in about half an hour, one thin strand at a time. After printing, some bioinks \nwill stiffen immediately; others need UV light or an additional \nchemical or physical process to stabilize the structure. If the printing process is successful, the cells in the synthetic tissue will begin to behave the same way\ncells do in real tissue: signaling to each other, exchanging \nnutrients, and multiplying. We can already print relatively simple \nstructures like this meniscus. Bioprinted bladders have also been \nsuccessfully implanted, and printed tissue has promoted facial \nnerve regeneration in rats. Researchers have created lung tissue,\nskin, and cartilage, as well as miniature, semi-functional \nversions of kidneys, livers, and hearts. However, replicating the complex \nbiochemical environment of a major organ \nis a steep challenge. Extrusion-based bioprinting may destroy a significant percentage of cells in the \nink if the nozzle is too small, or if the printing pressure is too high. One of the most formidable challenges is how to supply oxygen and nutrients \nto all the cells in a full-size organ. That’s why the greatest successes so far have been with structures \nthat are flat or hollow— and why researchers are busy \ndeveloping ways to incorporate blood vessels \ninto bioprinted tissue. There’s tremendous potential to use \nbioprinting to save lives and advance our \nunderstanding of how our organs function \nin the first place. And the technology opens up a dizzying \narray of possibilities, such as printing tissues with \nembedded electronics. Could we one day engineer organs that \nexceed current human capability, or give ourselves features like \nunburnable skin? How long might we extend human life \nby printing and replacing our organs? And exactly who—and what— will have access to this technology \nand its incredible output? "

        "text": "They call you the human cannonball, but you’re really more \nof a pinball person. Your act involves flying \nthrough a dozen rings of fire, bouncing through a trampoline course, and catching the trapezist \nin the grand finale. Your cannon has metal coils that \naccelerate you to the perfect speed. At least it’s supposed to. Today’s pre-flight test \nfails dramatically, and upon inspection, \nthis is a clear act of sabotage: someone amped the power up to the max. It’s too late to abort the launch; the trapezist will plummet if you don’t\ncatch him in a few minutes. So you’d better get fixing. The cannon was invented \nby your eccentric mentor, and as usual, his instructions leave\nsomething to be desired. The cannon’s electromagnet is powered \nby energy cells located in 16 chambers on two levels. Each level is a hollowed out square,\nwith three chambers to a side. The acceleration is survivable if: there are twice as many energy cells \nin the upper level as in the lower level. Every chamber has 1 to 3 \nenergy cells. And each side of the cannon, \nmade of 6 chambers, has 11 energy cells. Your mentor designed the cannon to use\na certain number of energy cells, but when the shipment arrived,\nit was 3 short. So he made all of those conditions\nwork with this reduced number, and it fired perfectly. That’s the amount you’ll need. Too many, or too few, \nand you and the trapezist are doomed. How many energy cells should you use, \nand where? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first step in this puzzle\nis to narrow the options. Let’s focus on rule 3 in isolation. We could put 11 cells in these two corners\nand fulfill it with just 22 total cells, because adjacent sides share corners. But if we put 11 in the middle chambers,\nwe could have 44 cells. The answer must be in the range\nbounded by those extremes. We can use the other rules \nto refine our options further. Since there are twice as many\ncells in the upper level, the total cells must be\na multiple of 3. Now, because of rule 4, we need to find two consecutive multiples\nof 3 that can meet all the conditions. Up to this point we haven’t used the rule\nthat each chamber must have 1 to 3 cells. It tells us that the minimum \nfor the lower level is 8 cells, in which case, by rule 1, \nthe upper level would have 16. On every side, the lower level would \naccount for 3 of the 11 cells, so the upper would have to have 8. But if two opposite sides had 8, that would be the upper level’s entire 16,\nnot leaving any for these two chambers. So 24 is out. Let’s look at the other extreme. The upper level can have \nat most 3 times 8, or 24 cells, which would give a total of 36. That eliminates 39 and 42. With 36, \nif we had 3 cells in each chamber, each side of the upper level would already\nhave 9 of its 11 cells, meaning we’d have to leave empty chambers\non the lower level. So 36 is also out. What about 33? We know we don’t want any sides \nwith all 3′s, so we can place 2′s at opposite\ncorners of the upper level. Now we have 8 of 11 cells per side. So we could place exactly 1 cell\nin each lower chamber... but that would fall short \nof the lower level’s required 11. That leaves only two options: 30 and 27, which must work by process of elimination, and 27 is the one you should use. To total 9, the lower level must have \nseven 1′s and one 2. If you put the 2 in a middle chamber, \nthe upper level would have too many cells. So the 2 has to go into a corner, and you can then place the upper level \nlike this. You’ve barely snapped \nthe last energy cell into place when you hear the ringleader\nannouncing your act. You’re pretty sure you’ve also noticed\nenough clues to solve the mystery. Who sabotaged you? "

        "text": "Every 24 hours, wind generates \nenough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more \nelectricity than humanity uses each day. And unlike coal or oil, this resource\nis totally renewed each day. So how can we harness this incredible\namount of energy, and is it possible to create a world\npowered entirely by wind? The basic principle of wind energy \nis simple. A series of sails or blades\nmounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy \ninto rotational energy. Traditional windmills use that rotational\nenergy to grind wheat or pump water. But in modern wind turbines, it turns \na generator that creates electricity. This conversion from wind \nto rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their \ninvention in the late 19th century. And there are three primary factors \nthat determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation\nof the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, \nand the amount of wind turning the rotor. First up, blade orientation. Wind turbines can be designed \nwith their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis. Vertical blades can pick up wind \ncoming from any direction, but with much less efficiency\nthan horizontal axis rotors. Horizontal designs allow blades to capture\nthe wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction \nand turning to face it. This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it\nthrough manual monitoring. Today, wind sensors and computer systems\nautomatically adjust the blades with expert precision\nto capture as much energy as possible. Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be\nshaped to maximize efficiency. While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved\nlike airplane wings. Wind travels faster over\nthe curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket \nabove the blade that forces it upwards. Since the amount of lift depends\non the angle at which the wind is moving \nrelative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut\ninto the wind. Made of fiberglass and resin layers, \nthese blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, \nand blistering sunlight for over 20 years. Even with aerodynamic blades\nand a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind\nif it's in a windy environment. Wind speeds typically increase the higher\ninto the atmosphere you travel. So today, most turbines are well\nover 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters. A turbine of this height and size can\ncapture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every\nyear to power 750 American homes. A wind farm of 200 similarly sized \nturbines could power over 150,000 American homes—\nor twice as many European homes— for an entire year. Offshore wind farms contain an even\ngreater number of even larger turbines. In 2019, the largest wind turbine \never built began operating off the coast \nof the Netherlands. With a rotor diameter of 220 meters,\njust one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs \nof 16,000 European households. Despite its amazing potential, \nwind energy still faces challenges. Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient \na turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much\nwind it can convert into electricity. German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain \nto keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% \nof the wind’s energy. Additionally, some people feel turbines\ndisrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent \navailability can make it difficult to integrate \ninto electrical grids. But even with these challenges,\nmodern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive \nsource of electricity. Wind turbines already provide essential\nenergy for communities around the world. And for many farmers, \nhosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source \nof additional income. With continued improvements\nin wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure\nand energy storage, wind power might blow away\nall our energy problems. "

        "text": "Today, plastics are everywhere. All of this plastic originated \nfrom one small object— that isn’t even made of plastic. For centuries, billiard balls were \nmade of ivory from elephant tusks. But when excessive hunting caused\nelephant populations to decline in the 19th century, billiard balls makers began to look \nfor alternatives, offering huge rewards. So in 1863 an American named \nJohn Wesley Hyatt took up the challenge. Over the next five years, he invented \na new material called celluloid, made from cellulose, a compound found\nin wood and straw. Hyatt soon discovered celluloid couldn’t\nsolve the billiard ball problem–– the material wasn’t heavy enough \nand didn’t bounce quite right. But it could be tinted and patterned to mimic more expensive\nmaterials like coral, tortoiseshell, amber, and mother-of-pearl. He had created what became\nknown as the first plastic. The word ‘plastic’ can describe \nany material made of polymers, which are just the large molecules\nconsisting of the same repeating subunit. This includes all human-made plastics, as well as many of the materials\nfound in living things. But in general, when people refer \nto plastics, they’re referring to synthetic materials. The unifying feature of these \nis that they start out soft and malleable and can be molded into a particular shape. Despite taking the prize \nas the first official plastic, celluloid was highly flammable,\nwhich made production risky. So inventors began to hunt\nfor alternatives. In 1907 a chemist combined phenol— a waste product of coal tar— and formaldehyde, creating \na hardy new polymer called bakelite. Bakelite was much less flammable \nthan celluloid and the raw materials used to make it were\nmore readily available. Bakelite was only the beginning. In the 1920s, researchers first\ncommercially developed polystyrene, a spongy plastic used in insulation. Soon after came polyvinyl chloride,\nor vinyl, which was flexible yet hardy. Acrylics created transparent, shatter-proof panels \nthat mimicked glass. And in the 1930s nylon took centre stage— a polymer designed to mimic silk, \nbut with many times its strength. Starting in 1933, polyethylene became\none of the most versatile plastics, still used today to make everything \nfrom grocery bags, to shampoo bottles, to bulletproof vests. New manufacturing technologies \naccompanied this explosion of materials. The invention of a technique \ncalled injection-moulding made it possible to insert melted plastics\ninto molds of any shape, where they would rapidly harden. This created possibilities for products\nin new varieties and shapes— and a way to inexpensively and rapidly \nproduce plastics at scale. Scientists hoped this economical \nnew material would make items that once had been\nunaffordable accessible to more people. Instead, plastics were pushed into service\nin World War Two. During the war, plastic production \nin the United States quadrupled. Soldiers wore new plastic helmet liners \nand water-resistant vinyl raincoats. Pilots sat in cockpits made of plexiglass,\na shatterproof plastic, and relied on parachutes \nmade of resilient nylon. Afterwards, plastic manufacturing \ncompanies that had sprung up during wartime turned\ntheir attention to consumer products. Plastics began to replace other materials\nlike wood, glass, and fabric in furniture, clothing, shoes,\ntelevisions, and radios. Versatile plastics opened up possibilities\nfor packaging— mainly designed to keep food \nand other products fresh for longer. Suddenly, there were plastic garbage bags,\nstretchy plastic wrap, squeezable plastic bottles, \ntakeaway cartons, and plastic containers for fruit,\nvegetables, and meat. Within just a few decades, \nthis multifaceted material ushered in what became known as\nthe “plastics century.” While the plastics century brought \nconvenience and cost-effectiveness, it also created staggering \nenvironmental problems. Many plastics are made of nonrenewable\nresources. And plastic packaging was designed\nto be single-use, but some plastics take centuries \nto decompose, creating a huge build up of waste. This century we’ll have to concentrate our\ninnovations on addressing those problems— by reducing plastic use,\ndeveloping biodegradable plastics, and finding new ways \nto recycle existing plastic.

In fact, most of the time desert locusts\nare no more dangerous than garden-variety grasshoppers. So what does it take to turn \nthese harmless insects into a crop-consuming plague? Desert locust eggs are laid \nin the damp depths of desert soil, in arid regions stretching \nfrom North Africa to South Asia. During the dry weather\ntypical in these ecosystems, desert locusts live a solitary lifestyle. Adolescent hoppers will spend\na few lonely weeks foraging for plants, before growing wings,\nreproducing, and dying. But when a region receives\nan abundance of rain, the scene is set \nfor a startling transformation. Increased moisture supports\nmore vegetation for newly hatched hoppers to eat, leading large groups to feed \nin close proximity. The frequent contact stimulates\ntheir leg hairs, triggering the release of a hormone that causes them to actively cluster \neven closer. Gluttonous crowds of locusts\nproduce huge amounts of poop, which carries a pheromone that furthers\ntheir transformation. The hopper’s diet shifts to include\nplants with toxic alkaloids. Soon, the locusts take on a striking\npattern that warns predators of their newly poisonous nature.

Roughly every week they shed \nand expand their exoskeletons, growing to roughly 50 times \ntheir hatching weight in just one month. Finally, the metamorphosis is complete. The adults beat their translucent wings \nand take flight as a full-fledged locust swarm. In this gregarious phase, these \nlong-winged, brightly colored creatures appear so different \nfrom their solitary counterparts that they were long thought \nto be a separate species. A typical swarm contains more locusts \nthan there are humans on the planet, covering hundreds of square kilometers\nin a dense cloud. At these numbers, desert locusts \neasily overwhelm their predators. A large swarm can match the daily food\nintake of a city of millions, and flying with the wind, the insect invasion can travel \nup to 150 kilometers a day. This living tornado can also\ncross large bodies of water. In 1988, a swarm even managed \nto traverse the Atlantic Ocean. The locusts likely formed rafts to rest\nat night, before fueling up in the morning with \na nourishing breakfast of their dead kin. While flying over land, \nthey seek out moist soil to lay eggs. Swarming mothers transfer their gregarious\ncondition to their offspring, making it likely that the next generation\nwill form another swarm. This means that while an individual \ndesert locust lives only three months, a plague can last up to a decade. The potential for a years-long plague\nisn’t unique to desert locusts, but the region they inhabit makes \nthe prospect particularly deadly. Their habitat spans \nsome of the world’s poorest countries, largely populated by people who grow\ntheir own food. By consuming crops and pastures, these insects directly endanger \n10% of humanity. Fortunately, a desert locust plague\ndoesn't last forever. When a wet period ends, vegetation becomes scarce \nand egg laying conditions decline. As existing swarms die off, new hatchlings\nspread out in search of food, creating enough distance to prevent\nsolitary locusts from transforming. Human intervention can also help. Researchers use satellite imagery \nto identify regions at risk of becoming locust hotspots \nand alert local governments. While most countries fight back \nwith chemical insecticides, some regions have found success using\nfungal diseases that are lethal to locusts but safe for people and the environment. Unfortunately, other modern practices\nare exacerbating the threat. Fields densely packed with a single crop\nare like a table set for locusts. And erratic weather caused by climate\nchange makes swarms harder to predict. If we plan to discourage lonely locusts\nfrom becoming catastrophic crowds, humans need to cut carbon emissions,\nrethink our agriculture, and generally reconsider \nour own ravenous appetites. "

        "text": "Take a moment to think\nabout the US Constitution. What's the first thing that comes to mind? Freedom of speech? Protection from illegal searches? The right to keep and bear arms? These passages are cited so often that we can hardly imagine the document\nwithout them, but that's exactly what the writers\nof the Constitution did. The list of individual freedoms\nknown as the Bill of Rights was not in the original text and wasn't added for another three years. So does this mean the founders\ndidn't consider them? The answer goes back to the very origins\nof the Constitution itself. Even prior to the first shots\nof the American Revolution, the Thirteen Colonies worked together\nthrough a provisional government called the Continental Congress. During the war in 1781, the Articles of Confederation \nwere ratified as the first truly national government. But establishing a new nation\nwould prove easier than running it. Congress had no power to make\nthe states comply with their laws. When the national government proved\nunable to raise funds, enforce foreign treaties, or suppress rebellions, it was clear reform was needed. So in May 1787, all the states\nbut Rhode Island sent delegates to Philidelphia\nfor a constitutional convention. A majority of these delegates favored\nintroducing a new national constitution to create a stronger federal government. Thanks to compromises on issues\nlike state representation, taxation power, and how to elect the president, their proposal gradually gained support. But the final text drafted in September still had to be approved by conventions\nheld in the states. So over the next few months, ratification would be debated\nacross the young nation. Among those who championed\nthe new document were leading statesmen Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. Together, they laid out eloquent\nphilosophical arguments for their positions\nin a series of 85 essays now known as the Federalist Papers. But others felt the Constitution\nwas overreaching and that more centralized authority would return the states to the sort\nof tyranny they had just escaped. These Anti-Federalists\nwere especially worried by the text's apparent lack of protections\nfor individual liberties. As the conventions proceeded, many of these critics shifted\nfrom opposing the Constitution entirely to insisting on adding an explicit\ndeclaration of rights. So what was the Federalists problem\nwith this idea? While their opponents accused them\nof despotism, wanting to maintain absolute power\nin the central government, their real motives were mostly practical. Changing the constitution when it\nhad already been ratified by some states could complicate the entire process. More importantly, Madison felt that\npeople's rights were already guaranteed through the democratic process, while adding extra provisions\nrisked misinterpretation. And some feared that creating an explicit\nlist of things the government can't do would imply that it can do\neverything else. After the first five states ratified\nthe Constitution quickly, the debate grew more intense. Massachusetts and several other states would only ratify if they could propose\ntheir own amendments for consideration. Leading Federalists recognized the need\nto compromise and promised to give them due regard. Once ratification by nine states finally\nbrought the Constitution into legal force, they made good on their promise. During a meeting of \nthe first United States Congress, representative James Madison stood on the House floor to propose\nthe very amendments he had previously believed\nto be unnecessary. After much debate and revision, first in the Congress, and then in the states, ten amendments were ratified\non December 15, 1791, over three years after\nthe US Constitution had become law. Today, every sentence, word,\nand punctuation mark in the Bill of RIghts is still considered fundamental\nto the freedoms Americans enjoy, even though the original framers\nleft them out. "

        "text": "Most people will take a pill, receive an injection, or otherwise take some kind of medicine\nduring their lives, but most of us don't know anything\nabout how these substances actually work. How can various compounds impact the way\nwe physically feel, think, and even behave? For the most part, this depends on\nhow a drug alters the communication between cells in the brain. There are a number of different ways\nthat can happen. But before it gets into the brain, any drug must first reach the bloodstream on a journey that can take anywhere\nfrom seconds to hours, depending on factors like how\nit's administered. The slowest method is to take\na drug orally because it must be absorbed by\nour digestive system before it takes effect. Inhaling a drug gets it into\nthe bloodstream faster. And injecting a drug intravenously\nworks quickly too because it pumps the chemicals directly\ninto the blood. Once there, the drug quickly reaches\nthe gates of its destination, the brain. The entrance to this organ is guarded\nby the blood-brain barrier, which separates blood \nfrom the nervous system to keep potentially dangerous \nsubstances out. So all drugs must have a specific\nchemical composition which gives them the key to unlock\nthis barrier and pass through. Once inside, drugs start to interfere\nwith the brain's normal functioning by targeting its web of neurons \nand synapses. Neurons are brain cells that have\na nucleus, dendrites, and an axon. Synapses are structures placed along\nthe dendrites or the axon which allow the exchange of \nelectrochemical signals between neurons. Those signals take the form of chemicals\ncalled neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter plays different\nroles in regulating our behaviors, emotions, and cognition. But they all work in one of two ways. They can either inhibit \nthe receiving neuron, limiting its activity, or excite it, creating a new electrochemical signal\nthat spreads throughout the network. Any leftover neurotransmitter usually\ngets degraded or reabsorbed \ninto the transmitting neuron. A drug's effectiveness stems \nfrom its ability to manipulate these synaptic transmissions\nat different phases of the process. That results in an increase or a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters\nbeing spread. For instance, common antidepressants,\nlike SSRIs, stop the reabsorption of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates\nour moods. This effectively pushes more of it\ninto the neural network. Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine, raise levels of serotonin \nand noradrenaline, which regulate energy, arousal, alertness, and pleasure. Those same neurotransmitters also\naffect endorphin receptors, reducing pain perception. And tranquilizers works by increasing\nthe production of GABA to inhibit neural activity putting the person in a relaxed\nor sedated state. What about illegal or elicit drugs? These have powerful impacts on the brain\nthat we're still trying to understand. Crystal meth, an amphetamine, induces a long-lasting release\nof dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked with\nthe perception of reward and pleasure. It also activates noradrenaline receptors, which increases the heart rate, dilates pupils, and triggers the body's fight\nor flight response. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine\nand serotonin, pushing more into the network where they boost energy, create feelings of euphoria, and suppress appetites. And hallucinogenic drugs have some\nof the most puzzling effects. Substances like LSD, mescaline, and DMT all block the release of serotonin, which regulates mood and impulsivity. They also have an impact \non the neural circuits involved in perception, learning,\nand behavioral regulation, which may explain why these drugs\nhave such powerful impacts. Even if some of these \neffects sound exciting, there are reasons why some of these drugs\nare highly controlled and often illegal. Drugs have the power to alter \nthe brain's chemistry, and repeated use can permanently\nrewire the neural networks that support our ability to think, make decisions, learn, and remember things. There's a lot we still don't know \nabout drugs and their effects, both the good and the bad. But those we do know about are the ones\nwe've studied closely, and turned into effective medicines. As our knowledge grows about drugs\nand the brain, the possibilities will also increase for treating the many medical problems\nthat puzzle researchers today. "

        "text": "Fish are in trouble. The cod population off Canada's East Coast\ncollapsed in the 1990s, intense recreational \nand commercial fishing has decimated goliath grouper populations\nin South Florida, and most populations of tuna\nhave plummeted by over 50%, with the Southern Atlantic bluefin\non the verge of extinction. Those are just a couple of many examples. Overfishing is happening \nall over the world. How did this happen? When some people think of fishing, they imagine relaxing in a boat\nand patiently reeling in the day's catch. But modern industrial fishing,\nthe kind that stocks our grocery shelves, looks more like warfare. In fact, the technologies they employ\nwere developed for war. Radar, sonar, helicopters, and spotter planes are all used to guide factory ships\ntowards dwindling schools of fish. Long lines with hundreds\nof hooks or huge nets round up massive amounts of fish,\nalong with other species, like seabirds, turtles, and dolphins. And fish are hauled up onto giant boats, complete with onboard flash freezing\nand processing facilities. All of these technologies have enabled\nus to catch fish at greater depths and farther out at sea than ever before. And as the distance and depth\nof fishing have expanded, so has the variety of species we target. For example, the Patagonian toothfish\nneither sounds nor looks very appetizing. And fishermen ignored it until\nthe late 1970s. Then it was rebranded and marketed\nto chefs in the U.S. as Chilean sea bass, despite the animal actually \nbeing a type of cod. Soon it was popping up in markets\nall over the world and is now a delicacy. Unfortunately, these deep water fish \ndon't reproduce until they're at least ten years old, making them extremely vulnerable\nto overfishing when the young are caught before they've\nhad the chance to spawn. Consumer taste and prices can\nalso have harmful effects. For example, shark fin soup is considered\nsuch a delicacy in China and Vietnam that the fin has become \nthe most profitable part of the shark. This leads many fishermen to fill\ntheir boats with fins leaving millions of dead sharks behind. The problems aren't unique\nto toothfish and sharks. Almost 31% of the world's fish populations\nare overfished, and another 58% are fished\nat the maximum sustainable level. Wild fish simply can't reproduce\nas fast as 7 billion people can eat them. Fishing also has impacts\non broader ecosystems. Wild shrimp are typically caught by\ndragging nets the size of a football field along the ocean bottom, disrupting or destroying\nseafloor habitats. The catch is often as little as 5% shrimp. The rest is by-catch, unwanted \nanimals that are thrown back dead. And coastal shrimp farming isn't\nmuch better. Mangroves are bulldozed to make room\nfor shrimp farms, robbing coastal communities of storm\nprotection and natural water filtration and depriving fish of key\nnursery habitats. So what does it look like to give\nfish a break and let them recover? Protection can take many forms. In national waters,\ngovernments can set limits about how, when, where, \nand how much fishing occurs, with restrictions on certain \nboats and equipment. Harmful practices, such as bottom \ntrawling, can be banned altogether, and we can establish marine reserves\nclosed to all fishing to help ecosystems restore themselves. There's also a role for consumer awareness\nand boycotts to reduce wasteful practices, like shark finning, and push fishing industries towards\nmore sustainable practices. Past interventions have successfully\nhelped depleted fish populations recover. There are many solutions. The best approach for each fishery\nmust be considered based on science, respect for the local communities\nthat rely on the ocean, and for fish as wild animals. And then the rules must be enforced. International collaboration is often\nneeded, too, because fish don't care about our borders. We need to end overfishing. Ecosystems, food security, jobs, economies, and coastal cultures all depend on it. "

        "text": "You hear the gentle lap of waves, the distant cawing of a seagull. But then an annoying whine\ninterrupts the peace, getting closer, and closer, and closer. Until...whack! You dispatch the offending mosquito, \nand calm is restored. How did you detect that noise from afar\nand target its maker with such precision? The ability to recognize sounds \nand identify their location is possible thanks to the auditory system. That’s comprised of two main parts: \nthe ear and the brain. The ear’s task is to convert sound energy\ninto neural signals; the brain’s is to receive and process \nthe information those signals contain. To understand how that works, we can follow a sound \non its journey into the ear. The source of a sound creates vibrations that travel as waves of pressure \nthrough particles in air, liquids, or solids. But our inner ear, called the cochlea, is actually filled \nwith saltwater-like fluids. So, the first problem to solve \nis how to convert those sound waves, wherever they’re coming from, into waves in the fluid. The solution is the eardrum, \nor tympanic membrane, and the tiny bones of the middle ear. Those convert the large movements \nof the eardrum into pressure waves \nin the fluid of the cochlea. When sound enters the ear canal, it hits the eardrum and makes it vibrate \nlike the head of a drum. The vibrating eardrum jerks a bone \ncalled the hammer, which hits the anvil and\nmoves the third bone called the stapes. Its motion pushes the fluid \nwithin the long chambers of the cochlea. Once there, the sound vibrations have finally\nbeen converted into vibrations of a fluid, and they travel like a wave \nfrom one end of the cochlea to the other. A surface called the basilar membrane \nruns the length of the cochlea. It’s lined with hair cells that have \nspecialized components called stereocilia, which move with the vibrations of the\ncochlear fluid and the basilar membrane. This movement triggers a signal \nthat travels through the hair cell, into the auditory nerve, then onward to the brain, \nwhich interprets it as a specific sound. When a sound makes \nthe basilar membrane vibrate, not every hair cell moves - only selected ones, \ndepending on the frequency of the sound. This comes down to some fine engineering. At one end, \nthe basilar membrane is stiff, vibrating only in response to short\nwavelength, high-frequency sounds. The other is more flexible, vibrating only in the presence of longer\nwavelength, low-frequency sounds. So, the noises made by the seagull \nand mosquito vibrate different locations \non the basilar membrane, like playing different keys on a piano. But that’s not all that’s going on. The brain still has another \nimportant task to fulfill: identifying where a sound is coming from. For that, it compares the sounds \ncoming into the two ears to locate the source in space. A sound from directly in front of you will\nreach both your ears at the same time. You’ll also hear it at the same intensity \nin each ear. However, a low-frequency sound \ncoming from one side will reach the near ear microseconds \nbefore the far one. And high-frequency sounds will sound\nmore intense to the near ear because they’re blocked \nfrom the far ear by your head. These strands of information \nreach special parts of the brainstem that analyze time and\nintensity differences between your ears. They send the results of their \nanalysis up to the auditory cortex. Now, the brain has \nall the information it needs: the patterns of activity \nthat tell us what the sound is, and information about \nwhere it is in space. Not everyone has normal hearing. Hearing loss is the third most common \nchronic disease in the world. Exposure to loud noises \nand some drugs can kill hair cells, preventing signals from traveling \nfrom the ear to the brain. Diseases like osteosclerosis freeze \nthe tiny bones in the ear so they no longer vibrate. And with tinnitus, the brain does strange things to make us think there’s a sound \nwhen there isn’t one. But when it does work, our hearing is an incredible, \nelegant system. Our ears enclose a fine-tuned piece \nof biological machinery that converts the cacophony of vibrations \nin the air around us into precisely tuned electrical impulses that distinguish claps, taps, \nsighs, and flies.

        "text": "Late one night in 1871, a group of riders \ndescended on a sleeping army camp. In minutes they stirred the camp \ninto a panic, stole about 70 horses,\nand disappeared. Led by a young chief \nnamed Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest \nin a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier \nbetween the indigenous people known as the Numunu, \nor Comanches, and the United States forces sent \nto steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie \nled the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel \ndrew near his targets, they disappeared without \na trace into the vast plains. The Comanches had controlled \nthis territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages\naround the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican \nattacks from the south, attempts to settle the land \nby the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’ \nbids for power. The Comanche Empire was not \none unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands, \neach with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common \nwas their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child \nwas adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both \nother indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area\nwith relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie \nfaced off. Born around 1848, Quanah \nwas the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band, \nand Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated\nwith the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village, \ncapturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought \nrefuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada. In the years that followed, Quanah \nproved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young \nwoman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father \nand several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing \nQuanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band \nwas able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast \nmarket for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions \nof buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led \na surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s \n1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender, \nQuanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced \ncertain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah \nand the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation \nin Oklahoma. As hunter-gatherers,\nthey could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life \non the reservation. The U.S. government had promised\nrations and supplies, but what they provided \nwas wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly \nin a weak political position: he had no wealth or power \ncompared to others who had been \non the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect \nfor cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement \nleasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights\nwith the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income\nfor the Comanches on the reservation. As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials\ngrew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction \nof schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges \non the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint \none chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed \noutside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported \nQuanah for this role, just as several older leaders \nhad supported him to lead them against \nthe U.S. armed forces. Even Quanah’s former adversary, \nRanald MacKenzie, advocated for his appointment. Quanah acted in Hollywood movies \nand befriended American politicians, riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s\ninauguration parade. Still, he never cut his long braids and advocated for the Native American \nChurch and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker, \nadopting his mother’s surname, and tried to track down \nhis mother and sister, eventually learning they had both \ndied shortly after their capture. Quanah adapted again and again—\nto different worlds, different roles, and circumstances that would seem \ninsurmountable to most. Though he wasn’t without critics, \nafter Quanah’s passing, Comanches began using the term “chairman” to designate the top elected official \nin the tribe, recognizing him \nas the last chief of the Comanches and a model of cultural \nsurvival and adaptation. In that spirit, today’s Comanche Nation\nlooks towards the future, with over 16,000 enrolled citizens \nand countless descendants. "

        "text": "Whether or not you realize it, as a surfer you’re a master \nof complicated physics. The science of surfing begins as soon as you and your board \nfirst hit the water. The board’s size and light construction \nhelp it displace a lot of water. In turn, a buoyant force equal to the weight of the \ndisplaced water pushes up, counteracting you and your board’s weight. This lets you stay afloat while \nyou wait to paddle for a wave. And what exactly are you waiting for? The perfect wave, of course. Like other waves in physics, ocean waves\nrepresent a transfer of energy. Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates \nwater particles near the surface, leading to the growth of ripples \nthat become waves. These deviations from the flat surface \nare acted upon by gravity, which tries to restore the surface \nto its original flat state. As the waves then move through the water, particles push and pull on their neighbors\nthrough the wave induced pressure, and this motion propagates energy through \nthe water in unison with the wave motion. The motion of these particles is much more limited than the \noverall motion of the waves. Near the shore, the shallower seafloor constrains \nthe motion of the waves to occur in a more limited region \nthan out at sea, concentrating the wave energy \nnear the surface. If the topography of the shoreline \nis even and smooth, this will refract the waves \nto become more parallel to the shore as they approach. This is the crucial moment. As the wave gets near, you quickly pivot your board \nin the same direction as the wave and paddle to match its speed. Your board forms an angle with the water, and this creates a dynamic pressure \non the bottom of it, forcing you and your board \nout of the water, to skim along the surface. At the same time, your increased forward momentum \nmakes you more stable, allowing you to stand up \nand surf along the wave. Now you’ve caught the wave, and are riding along its front \nface parallel to the shoreline. Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter \nyour speed and direction by repositioning your weight. Above you is the wave’s crest, where the water particles are undergoing\ntheir greatest acceleration. That forces them to move faster \nthan the underlying wave, so they shoot ahead before falling under\ngravity’s influence. This forms the waves’ characteristic\ncurls, or jets, as they break along the shore. Sometimes, the curl might completely \nenclose part of the wave, forming a moving tube of water \nknown as the barrel. Because of irregularities in the seafloor \nand the swell itself, few barrels last as long as the legendary \n27-second ride off the coast of Namibia. But many who manage to get barreled have said they feel time \npassing differently inside, making it one of the most magical \nexperiences a surfer can have. Of course, not all beaches are created equal. Offshore underwater canyons or rock\nformations in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal\nor Mavericks, California refract the incoming wave energy \ninto a single spot, creating massive waves \nsought by surfers worldwide. And some of these waves travel \nfor more than a week, with swells originating more than 10,000 \nkilometers away from shore. Waves surfed in sunny California may have originated in the stormy \nseas near New Zealand. So while you may not be thinking about \nweather patterns in the South Pacific, tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics, the art of catching the perfect wave \nrelies on all these things and more. And the waves we surf, created by wind, are just one visible part of the \ncontinuous oscillation of energy that has shaped our universe \nsince its very beginning. "

        "text": "Transcriber: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Jessica Ruby In all times and places in our history, human beings have wondered, \"Where did we come from? What's our place in the world? What happens to us after we die?\" Religions are systems of belief that have developed and evolved over time in response to these and other eternal mysteries, driven by the feeling that some questions can only be answered by faith and based on an intuition that there is something greater than ourselves, a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return. Hinduism means the religions of India. It's not a single religion but rather a variety of related beliefs and spiritual practices. It dates back five millennia to the time of Krishna, a man of such virtue that he became known as an avatar of Vishnu, an incarnation of the god in human form. He taught that all life follows karma, the law of cause and effect, and our job is to do our duty, or dharma, according to our place in society without worrying how things turn out. When we die, we are reincarnated into a new body. If we followed our dharma and did our proper duty in our past life, we get good karma, which sends our soul upward in the social scale. Our rebirth into the next life is thus determined by what we do in this one. The wheel of rebirths is called samsara. It's possible for a very holy person to lead a life with enough good karma to escape the wheel. This escape is called moksha. Hinduism teaches that everything is one. The whole universe is one transcendent reality called Brahman, and there's just one Brahman but many gods within it, and their roles, aspects, and forms differ according to various traditions. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the preserver who sometimes takes on human form, and Shiva is the transformer, or Lord of the Dance. Durga is the fiercely protective divine mother. Ganesha has an elephant head and is the wise patron of success. Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world. And although most Hindus live in India, they can be found on every continent, one billion strong. Now, let's travel west, across deserts and mountains to the fertile crescent about 4,000 years ago. Judaism began with God calling Abraham and Sarah to leave Mesopotamia and migrate to the land of Canaan. In return for their faith in the one true God, a revolutionary concept in the polytheistic world of that time, they would have land and many descendants. From this promise came the land of Israel and the chosen people, but staying in that land and keeping those people together was going to be very difficult. The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, but God freed them with the help of the prophet Moses, who received the Ten Commandments and later hundreds more. They conquered the Promised Land, but could only keep it for a few hundred years. Israel sits at a crossroads through which many armies marched over the centuries. And in the year 70, the Romans destroyed the temple in their capital, Jerusalem. So, the religion transformed itself from a temple religion with sacrifices and priests to a religion of the book. Because of this, Judaism is a faith of symbolism, reverence, and deep meanings tied to the literature of its history. The many sacred scriptures make up the Hebrew bible, or Tanakh, and hundreds of written discussions and interpretations are contained in an expansive compendium of deeper meanings, called the Talmud. Jews find rich, symbolic meaning in daily life. At the Passover meal, every item on the menu symbolizes an aspect of the escape from slavery. The importance of growing up is emphasized when young people reach the age of bar and bat mitzvah, ceremonies during which they assume responsibility for their actions and celebrate the weaving of their own lives into the faith, history, and texts of the Jewish people. There are 14 million Jews in the world today, 6 million in Israel, which became independent following the horrors of genocide in World War II, and 5 million in the United States. But now let's go back 2500 years and return to India where Buddhism began with a young prince named Siddhartha. On the night he was conceived, his mother, Queen Maya, is said to have been visited in her sleep by a white elephant who entered her side. Ten months later, Prince Siddartha was born into a life of luxury. Venturing forth from his sheltered existence as a young man, he witnessed the human suffering that had been hidden from him and immediately set out to investigate its sources. Why must people endure suffering? Must we reincarnate through hundreds of lives? At first he thought the problem was attachment to material things, so he gave up his possessions. He became a wandering beggar, which he discovered certainly made him no happier. Then he overheard a music teacher telling a student, \"Don't tighten the string too much, it will break. But don't let it go too slack, or it will not sound.\" In a flash, he realized that looking for answers at the extremes was a mistake. The middle way between luxury and poverty seemed wisest. And while meditating under a bodhi tree, the rest of the answer came to him. All of life abounds with suffering. It's caused by selfish craving for one's own fulfillment at the expense of others. Following an eight-step plan can teach us to reduce that craving, and thus reduce the suffering. On that day, Siddhartha became the Buddha, the enlightened one. Not the only one, but the first one. The Buddhist plan is called the Eightfold Path, and though it is not easy to follow, it has pointed the way for millions to enlightenment, which is what Buddhahood means, a state of compassion, insight, peace, and steadfastness. From the time he got up from under that tree to the moment of his death as an old man, the Buddha taught people how to become enlightened: right speech, right goals, a mind focused on what is real, and a heart focused on loving others. Many Buddhists believe in God or gods, but actions are more important than beliefs. There are nearly a billion Buddhists in the world today, mostly in East, Southeast, and South Asia. 2,000 years ago in Judaism's Promised Land, Christianity was born. Just as Hindus called Krishna \"God in Human Form,\" Christians say the same thing about Jesus, and Christianity grew out of Judaism just as Buddhism grew out of Hinduism. The angel Gabriel was sent by the God of Abraham to ask a young woman named Mary to become the mother of his son. The son was Jesus, raised as a carpenter by Mary and her husband Joseph, until he turned 30, when he began his public career as the living word of God. Less interested in religiousness than in justice and mercy, Jesus healed the sick in order to draw crowds and then taught them about his heavenly father -- affectionate, forgiving, and attentive. Then, he would invite everyone to a common table to illustrate his Kingdom of God, outcasts, sinners, and saints all eating together. He had only three years before his unconventional wisdom got him into trouble. His enemies had him arrested, and he was executed by Rome in the standard means by which rabble-rousers were put to death, crucifixion. But shortly after he was buried, women found his tomb empty and quickly spread word, convinced that he had been raised from the dead. The first Christians described his resurrected appearances, inspiring confidence that his message was true. The message: love one another as I have loved you. Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus in December at Christmas, and his suffering, death, and resurrection during Holy Week in the spring. In the ceremony of baptism, a washing away of sin and welcoming into the Christian community, recall Jesus's own baptism when he left his life as a carpenter. In the rite of Communion, Christians eat the bread and drink the wine blessed as the body and blood of Jesus, recalling Jesus's last supper. There are two billion Christians worldwide, representing almost a third of the world's people. Islam began 1400 years ago with a man of great virtue, meditating in a mountain cave in the Arabian desert. The man was Muhammad. He was visited by a divine messenger, again the angel Gabriel, in Arabic, Jibril, delivering to him the words of Allah, the one God of Abraham. In the next few years, more and more messages came, and he memorized and taught them. The verses he recited were full of wise sayings, beautiful rhymes, and mysterious metaphors. But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet. Many agreed the verses were indeed the words of God, and these believers became the first Muslims. The word Muslim means one who surrenders, meaning a person who submits to the will of God. A Muslim's five most important duties are called the Five Pillars: Shahada, Muslims declare publicly, there is no other God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet; Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca; Zakat, every Muslim is required to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor; Sawm, they fast during daylight hours for the lunar month of Ramadan to strengthen their willpower and their reliance on God; and Hajj, once in a lifetime, every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, rehearsing for the time when they will stand before God to be judged worthy or unworthy of eternal life with Him. The words of God, revealed to the prophet over 23 years, are collected in the Quran, which literally translates into \"the recitation.\" Muslims believe it to be the only holy book free of human corruption. It's also considered by many to be the finest work of literature in the Arabic language. Islam is the world's second largest religion, practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe. Religion has been an aspect of culture for as long as it has existed, and there are countless variations of its practice. But common to all religions is an appeal for meaning beyond the empty vanities and lowly realities of existence, beyond sin, suffering, and death, beyond fear, and beyond ourselves. "

        "text": "Gripped with vengeful passion, The Queen of the Night \ntears across the stage. She begins to sing her titular aria, one of the most famous sections \nfrom Mozart’s beloved opera, \"The Magic Flute.\" The orchestra fills the hall with music, but the queen’s voice soars above \nthe instruments. Its melody rings out \nacross thousands of patrons, reaching seats 40 meters away— all without any assistance \nfrom a microphone. How is it possible that this single voice\ncan be heard so clearly, above the strains \nof dozens of instruments? The answer lies in the physics \nof the human voice, and the carefully honed technique \nof an expert opera singer. All the music in this opera house \noriginates from the vibrations created by instruments— whether it’s the strings of a violin \nor the vocal folds of a performer. These vibrations send waves into the air, \nwhich our brains interpret as sound. The frequency of these vibrations–– specifically, the number \nof waves per second–– is how our brains determine \nthe pitch of a single note. But in fact, every note we hear is actually a combination \nof multiple vibrations. Imagine a guitar string vibrating \nat its lowest frequency. This is called the fundamental, and this low pitch is what our ears \nmostly use to identify a note. But this lowest vibration triggers \nadditional frequencies called overtones, which layer on top of the fundamental. These overtones break down \ninto specific frequencies called harmonics, or partials— and manipulating them \nis how opera singers work their magic. Every note has a set of frequencies \nthat comprise its harmonic series. The first partial vibrates \nat twice the frequency of the fundamental. The next partial is three times \nthe fundamental’s frequency, and so on. Virtually all acoustic instruments \nproduce harmonic series, but each instrument’s shape and material\nchanges the balance of its harmonics. For example, a flute emphasizes \nthe first few partials, but in a clarinet’s lowest register, the odd-numbered partials \nresonate most strongly. The strength of various partials is part of what gives each instrument\nits unique sonic signature. It also affects an instrument’s ability \nto stand out in a crowd, because our ears are more strongly \nattuned to some frequencies than others. This is the key to an opera singer’s \npower of projection. An operatic soprano— the highest of the four standard \nvoice parts— can produce notes \nwith fundamental frequencies ranging from 250 to 1,500 vibrations \nper second. Human ears are most sensitive \nto frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 \nvibrations per second. So if the singer can bring out \nthe partials in this range, she can target a sensory sweet spot \nwhere she’s most likely to be heard. Higher partials are also advantageous because there’s less competition \nfrom the orchestra, whose overtones are weaker \nat those frequencies. The result of emphasizing \nthese partials is a distinctive ringing timbre \ncalled a singer’s squillo. Opera singers work for decades \nto create their squillo. They can produce higher frequencies by modifying the shape and tension \nin their vocal folds and vocal tract. And by shifting the position \nof their tongues and lips, they accentuate some overtones \nwhile dampening others. Singers also increase their range \nof partials with vibrato— a musical effect in which a note \nslightly oscillates in pitch. This creates a fuller sound \nthat rings out over the instruments’ \ncomparatively narrow vibratos. Once they have the right partials, they employ other techniques \nto boost their volume. Singers expand their lung capacity \nand perfect their posture for consistent, controlled airflow. The concert hall helps as well, with rigid surfaces that reflect \nsound waves towards the audience. All singers take advantage \nof these techniques, but different vocal signatures \ndemand different physical preparation. A Wagnerian singer needs \nto build up stamina to power through the composer’s \nfour-hour epics. While bel canto singers require \nversatile vocal folds to vault through acrobatic arias. Biology also sets some limits— not every technique is feasible \nfor every set of muscles, and voices change as singers age. But whether in an opera hall \nor a shower stall, these techniques can turn \nun-amplified voices into thundering musical masterpieces. "

Across India, people hold their breath \nfor the declaration of independence after nearly two centuries of British \noccupation and rule. And at the stroke of midnight, a squirming infant and two new \nnations are born in perfect synchronicity. These events form the foundation \nof \"Midnight’s Children,\" a dazzling novel by the British-Indian \nauthor Salman Rushdie. The baby who is the exact same age \nas the nation is Saleem Sinai, the novel’s protagonist. His narrative stretches over \n30 years of his life, jumping backwards and forwards in time \nto speculate on family secrets and deep-seated mysteries. These include the greatest enigma of all: \nSaleem has magic powers, and they’re somehow related \nto the time of his birth. And he’s not the only one. All children born in and around \nthe stroke of midnight are imbued with extraordinary powers; like Parvati the Witch, \na spectacular conjurer; and Saleem’s nemesis Shiva, \na gifted warrior. With his powers of telepathy, Saleem forges connections with a \nvast network of the children of midnight— including a figure who can step \nthrough time and mirrors, a child who changes their gender \nwhen immersed in water, and multilingual conjoined twins. Saleem acts as a delightful guide \nto magical happenings and historical context alike. Although his birthday is a day \nof celebration, it also marks a turbulent period \nin Indian history. In 1948, the leader of the Indian \nindependence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, was assassinated. Independence also coincided \nwith Partition, which divided British-controlled India  into the two nations of India \nand Pakistan. This contributed to the outbreak of \nthe Indo-Pakistani Wars in 1965 and 1971. Saleem touches on all this and more, tracing the establishment \nof Bangladesh in 1971 and the emergency rule of Indira Gandhi. This vast historical frame is one \nreason why \"Midnight’s Children\" is considered one of the most illuminating\nworks of postcolonial literature ever written. This genre typically addresses the \nexperience of people living in colonized and formerly colonized countries, and explores the fallout through themes \nlike revolution, migration, and identity. Rushdie, who like Saleem was born in 1947,\nwas educated in India and Britain, and is renowned for his cross-continental \nhistories, political commentary, and magical realism. He enriches \"Midnight’s Children\" \nwith a plethora of Indian and Pakistani cultural references, from family traditions to food, \nreligion and folktales. Scribbling by night under the \nwatchful eyes of his lover Padma, Saleem’s frame narrative echoes \nthat of \"1001 Nights,\" where a woman named Scheherazade \ntells her king a series of stories to keep herself alive. And as Saleem sees it, 1001 is “the number of night, of magic, \nof alternative realities.” Over the course of the novel, Rushdie dazzles us with \nmultiple versions of reality. Sometimes, this is like reading \na rollercoaster. Saleem narrates: “Who what am I? My answer: I am everyone everything whose being-in-\nthe-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens \nafter I’ve gone which would not have happened \nif I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional \nin this matter; each 'I,' every one of the now-six-\nhundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, \nyou’ll have to swallow a world.” Saleem’s narrative often has \na breathless quality— and even as Rushdie depicts the \ncosmological consequences of a life, he questions the idea that we can ever \ncondense history into a single narrative. His mind-bending plot and \nshapeshifting characters have garnered continuing \nfascination and praise. Not only did \"Midnight’s Children\" win \nthe prestigious Man Booker Prize in its year of publication, but in a 2008 competition that pitted \nall 39 winners against each other, it was named the best of all the winners. In a masterpiece of epic proportions, Rushdie reveals that there \nare no singular truths— rather, it’s wiser to believe in several \nversions of reality at once, hold many lives in the \npalms of our hands, and experience multiple moments \nin a single stroke of the clock.

        "text": "Translator: tom carter\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Literary critic Northrop Frye once observed that in our primitive days, our literary heroes were -- well, nearly gods, and as civilization advanced, they came down the mountain of the gods, so to speak, and became more human, more flawed, less heroic. From the divine heroes like Hercules, down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as Beowulf, the great leaders such as King Arthur, and the great but flawed heroes like Macbeth or Othello. Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, or Hiccup, until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero. Contrary to the sound, the anti-hero is not the villain, not the antagonist. The anti-hero is actually the main character in some contemporary works of literature. Guy Montag in \"Fahrenheit 451,\" Winston Smith in \"1984,\" who unwittingly ends up challenging those in power -- that is, those who abuse their power to brainwash the populace to believe that the ills of society have been eliminated. Ideally, those who challenge the establishment should be wise, confident, brave, physically strong, with a type of charisma that inpires followers. The anti-hero, however, at best demonstrates a few underdeveloped traits, at worst, is totally inept. The story of the anti-hero usually unfolds something like this. The anti-hero initially conforms, ignorantly accepting the established views, a typical, unquestioning, brainwashed member of society. The anti-hero struggles to conform, all the while starting to object, perhaps finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions, and naïvely, unwisely, sharing those questions with an authority figure. The anti-hero openly challenges society, and tries to fight against the lies and tactics used to oppress the populace. This step, for the anti-hero, is seldom a matter of brave, wise and heroic opposition. Maybe the anti-hero fights and succeeds in destroying the oppressive government, with a lot of impossible luck. Perhaps he or she runs away, escapes to fight another day. All too often though, the anti-hero is killed, or brainwashed to return to conformity with the masses. No heroic triumph here, no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern world, inspiring others to fight, or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive army of the evil empire. Our storytelling ancestors calmed our fears of powerlessness by giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demons and monsters that we suspected haunted the night beyond our campfires. But eventually, we realized the monsters did not lie out there, they reside inside of us. Beowulf's greatest enemy was mortality. Othello's, jealousy. Hiccup, self-doubt. And in the tales of the ineffectual anti-hero, in the stories of Guy Montag and Winston Smith, lie the warnings of contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fears: that we are not strong enough to defeat the monsters. Only this time, not the monsters chased away by the campfire, but the very monsters who built the campfire in the first place. "

        "text": "When Nicolas Bourbaki applied \nto the American Mathematical Society in the 1950s, he was already one of the most influential\nmathematicians of his time. He’d published articles \nin international journals and his textbooks were required reading. Yet his application was firmly rejected \nfor one simple reason— Nicolas Bourbaki did not exist. Two decades earlier, \nmathematics was in disarray. Many established mathematicians had lost \ntheir lives in the first World War, and the field had become fragmented. Different branches used disparate \nmethodology to pursue their own goals. And the lack of a shared \nmathematical language made it difficult to share \nor expand their work. In 1934, a group of French mathematicians \nwere particularly fed up. While studying at the prestigious \nÉcole normale supérieure, they found the textbook \nfor their calculus class so disjointed that they decided to write a better one. The small group \nquickly took on new members, and as the project grew, \nso did their ambition. The result was \nthe \"Éléments de mathématique,\" a treatise that sought to create \na consistent logical framework unifying every branch of mathematics. The text began \nwith a set of simple axioms— laws and assumptions it would use \nto build its argument. From there, its authors derived \nmore and more complex theorems that corresponded with work \nbeing done across the field. But to truly reveal common ground, the group needed to identify \nconsistent rules that applied to a wide range of problems. To accomplish this, they gave new, \nclear definitions to some of the most important \nmathematical objects, including the function. It’s reasonable to think of functions \nas machines that accept inputs and produce an output. But if we think of functions \nas bridges between two groups, we can start to make claims about \nthe logical relationships between them. For example, consider a group of numbers\nand a group of letters. We could define a function where \nevery numerical input corresponds to the same alphabetical output, but this doesn’t establish \na particularly interesting relationship. Alternatively, we could define a function \nwhere every numerical input corresponds to a different \nalphabetical output. This second function sets up \na logical relationship where performing a process on the input \nhas corresponding effects on its mapped output. The group began to define functions by how\nthey mapped elements across domains. If a function’s output came \nfrom a unique input, they defined it as injective. If every output can be mapped \nonto at least one input, the function was surjective. And in bijective functions, each element \nhad perfect one to one correspondence. This allowed mathematicians to establish \nlogic that could be translated across the function’s domains \nin both directions. Their systematic approach \nto abstract principles was in stark contrast to the popular \nbelief that math was an intuitive science, and an over-dependence on logic \nconstrained creativity. But this rebellious band of scholars \ngleefully ignored conventional wisdom. They were revolutionizing the field, \nand they wanted to mark the occasion with their biggest stunt yet. They decided to publish \n\"Éléments de mathématique\" and all their subsequent work \nunder a collective pseudonym: Nicolas Bourbaki. Over the next two decades, Bourbaki’s \npublications became standard references. And the group’s members took their prank \nas seriously as their work. Their invented mathematician claimed \nto be a reclusive Russian genius who would only meet \nwith his selected collaborators. They sent telegrams in Bourbaki’s name, \nannounced his daughter’s wedding, and publicly insulted anyone \nwho doubted his existence. In 1968, when they could \nno longer maintain the ruse, the group ended their joke \nthe only way they could. They printed Bourbaki’s obituary,\ncomplete with mathematical puns. Despite his apparent death, the group \nbearing Bourbaki’s name lives on today. Though he’s not associated \nwith any single major discovery, Bourbaki’s influence informs \nmuch current research. And the modern emphasis on formal proofs\nowes a great deal to his rigorous methods. Nicolas Bourbaki may have been imaginary— \nbut his legacy is very real. "

It’s a still morning–\nunusually still, and the lack of wind is the latest \nin a series of troubling signs. The year is 1400 BCE. Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, \ntreeless desert between the towering Andes \nand Pacific Ocean. The villagers live off the sea, \nharvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, \nand using them to build fishing boats. Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats\nto hunt shark and other fish while the women harvest \nshellfish and sea urchins. In winter, storms bring powerful waves,\nwhich cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores. Most years, Quexo’s village catches \nmore than enough fish. But this year, the winds have died \nand the fish have dwindled. Quexo has seen this pattern before: the fish disappear, \nthen the violent rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve \nmud bricks and wash away settlements. He needs to stop the bad weather \nbefore the storms come— his only hope is a special ritual \nhe’s been planning. Quexo spends much less time\nin the ocean than the other villagers. He became a shaman after seeing \na sign in the sea one morning— like his father and grandfather\nbefore him. This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain \nas the sun rises. There, he gathers ceremonial cactus \nand herbs like “horse tail,” “stonebreaker,\" and valerian, \nalong with the mineral hematite. Back in the village, \neveryone is preparing to leave for a religious festival \nat a large temple inland. The festival marks the beginning of what\nis usually the season of abundance, but with the signs pointing to storms,\nQuexo isn’t feeling too celebratory. Whole families travel to the festival,\nwhere they camp for a few days. They’ve packed seaweed, carved bones,\ngourd bowls, reed mats, and other goods to trade \nin the market around the temple. Quexo inspects the goods to make \nsure everything is of the finest quality. He brings the herbs he gathered \nto trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes \nfrom the highlands in the Andes. He needs cinnabar for his ritual \nto ward off the storms. Around lunchtime, the sprawling \ntemple rises out of the desert ahead. People have come from all along \nthe coast and the foothills. The women handle trade transactions—\nthey’re looking for cotton and ceramics. Men aren’t usually allowed \nto do the trading, but shamans are an exception. Though Quexo is a man, during rituals \nhe becomes half man, half woman, and this ambiguity makes his role \nmore flexible outside ceremonies too. Quexo can’t find any cinnabar \nin the market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza. He puts on his ceremonial garb: \nred face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth\nand vertebrae. Inside, the ceremonies \nare already underway, and the shamans have drunk\nthe sacred cactus drink. Many of them are Quexo’s friends \nfrom festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans \nwho would have cinnabar. He begins to panic. If the highland shamans don’t show up, his only option will be to make \nthe long walk into the mountains. It’s a dangerous journey \nthat takes five days, precious time he doesn’t have to waste. But perhaps he has no choice. He refuses the sacred cactus \nand sets off toward the mountains. As he leaves the settlement behind,\nhe sees a group approaching. He recognizes them as highlanders\nby their llamas. He dashes toward their shaman. Barely pausing to say hello, \nhe offers him hematite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime\nand chew with coca leaves. In return, the other shaman \ngives him the precious cinnabar. With the key to his ritual in hand, Quexo heads home to the temple \nof the fisherman in hopes of turning the tide. "

        "text": "Every day of your life, you move through systems of power\nthat other people made. Do you sense them? Do you understand power? Do you realize why it matters? Power is something we are often\nuncomfortable talking about. That's especially true in civic life,\nhow we live together in community. In a democracy, power is supposed to\nreside with the people, period. Any further talk about power\nand who really has it seems a little dirty,\nmaybe even evil. But power is no more inherently good or\nevil than fire or physics. It just is. It governs how any form of \ngovernment works. It determines who gets to determine\nthe rules of the game. So learning how power operates is key\nto being effective, being taken seriously,\nand not being taken advantage of. In this lesson, we'll look at where\npower comes from, how it's exercised and what you can do to\nbecome more powerful in public life. Let's start with a basic definition. Power is the ability to make others do\nwhat you would have them do. Of course, this plays out in \nall arenas of life, from family to the workplace \nto our relationships. Our focus is on the civic arena, where power means getting a community\nto make the choices and to take the actions that you want. There are six main sources of civic power. First, there's physical force\nand a capacity for violence. Control of the means of force,\nwhether in the police or a militia, is power at its most primal. A second core source \nof power is wealth. Money creates the ability to buy results\nand to buy almost any other kind of power. The third form of power is state action,\ngovernment. This is the use of law and \nbureaucracy to compel people to do or not do certain things. In a democracy, for example,\nwe the people, theoretically, give government its power\nthrough elections. In a dictatorship, state power emerges\nfrom the threat of force, not the consent of the governed. The fourth type of power is social norms\nor what other people think is okay. Norms don't have the centralized\nmachinery of government. They operate in a softer way,\npeer to peer. They can certainly make people\nchange behavior and even change laws. Think about how norms around marriage\nequality today are evolving. The fifth form of power is ideas. An idea, individual liberties, say,\nor racial equality, can generate boundless amounts\nof power if it motivates enough people to change\ntheir thinking and actions. And so the sixth source of \npower is numbers, lots of humans. A vocal mass of people creates\npower by expressing collective intensity of interest and by asserting legitimacy. Think of the Arab Spring\nor the rise of the Tea Party. Crowds count. These are the six main sources of power,\nwhat power is. So now, let's think about how\npower operates. There are three laws of power \nworth examining. Law number one:\npower is never static. It's always either accumulating\nor decaying in a civic arena. So if you aren't taking action,\nyou're being acted upon. Law number two:\npower is like water. It flows like a current \nthrough everyday life. Politics is the work of harnessing \nthat flow in a direction you prefer. Policymaking is an effort to freeze\nand perpetuate a particular flow of power. Policy is power frozen. Law number three:\npower compounds. Power begets more power,\nand so does powerlessness. The only thing that keeps law\nnumber three from leading to a situation where only one person has all the power is how we apply laws one and two. What rules do we set up so that a few\npeople don't accumulate too much power, and so that they can't enshrine their\nprivilege in policy? That's the question of democracy, and you can see each of these laws at work\nin any news story. Low wage workers organize to\nget higher pay. Oil companies push to get a big\npipeline approved. Gay and lesbian couples seek the legal\nright to marry. Urban parents demand school vouchers. You may support these efforts or not. Whether you get what you want depends\non how adept you are with power, which brings us finally to what you can do\nto become more powerful in public life. Here, it's useful to think in\nterms of literacy. Your challenge is to learn how to read \npower and write power. To read power means to pay attention to\nas many texts of power as you can. I don't mean books only. I mean seeing society as a set of texts. Don't like how things are in your campus\nor city or country? Map out who has what kind of power,\narrayed in what systems. Understand why it turned out this way, who's made it so, \nand who wants to keep it so. Study the strategies others\nin such situations used: frontal attack or indirection, coalitions or charismatic authority. Read so you may write. To write power requires first that you \nbelieve you have the right to write, to be an author of change. You do. As with any kind of writing,\nyou learn to express yourself, speak up in a voice that's authentic. Organize your ideas, \nthen organize other people. Practice consensus building. Practice conflict. As with writing,\nit's all about practice. Every day you have a chance to practice,\nin your neighborhood and beyond. Set objectives, then bigger ones. Watch the patterns, see what works. Adapt, repeat. This is citizenship. In this short lesson, we've explored where\ncivic power comes from, how it works\nand what you can do to exercise it. One big question remaining\nis the \"why\" of power. Do you want power to benefit everyone\nor only you? Are your purposes\npro-social or anti-social? This question isn't about strategy. It's about character,\nand that's another set of lessons. But remember this: Power plus character\nequals a great citizen, and you have the power to be one. "

        "text": "There's a quote usually attributed\nto the writer Mark Twain that goes, \"A lie can travel \nhalfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.\" Funny thing about that. There's reason to doubt\nthat Mark Twain ever said this at all, thus, ironically, proving the point. And today, the quote, whoever said it,\nis truer than ever before. In previous decades, \nmost media with global reach consisted of several \nmajor newspapers and networks which had the resources\nto gather information directly. Outlets like Reuters\nand the Associated Press that aggregate or rereport stories\nwere relatively rare compared to today. The speed with which \ninformation spreads now has created the ideal conditions for\na phenomenon known as circular reporting. This is when publication A\npublishes misinformation, publication B reprints it, and publication A then cites B\nas the source for the information. It's also considered a form\nof circular reporting when multiple publications report on the same initial piece \nof false information, which then appears to another author as\nhaving been verified by multiple sources. For instance, the 1998 publication\nof a single pseudoscientific paper arguing that routine vaccination\nof children causes autism inspired an entire \nantivaccination movement, despite the fact that the original paper\nhas repeatedly been discredited by the scientific community. Deliberately unvaccinated children\nare now contracting contagious diseases that had been virtually \neradicated in the United States, with some infections proving fatal. In a slightly less dire example, satirical articles that are formatted\nto resemble real ones can also be picked up by outlets\nnot in on the joke. For example, a joke article in the\nreputable British Medical Journal entitled \"Energy Expenditure in Adolescents\nPlaying New Generation Computer Games,\" has been referenced in serious\nscience publications over 400 times. User-generated content, such as wikis, are also a common contributer\nto circular reporting. As more writers come to rely\non such pages for quick information, an unverified fact in a wiki page\ncan make its way into a published article that may later be added as a citation\nfor the very same wiki information, making it much harder to debunk. Recent advances \nin communication technology have had immeasurable benefits in breaking down the barriers\nbetween information and people. But our desire for quick answers may overpower the desire \nto be certain of their validity. And when this bias can be multiplied by\nbillions of people around the world, nearly instantaneously,\nmore caution is in order. Avoiding sensationalist media, searching for criticisms \nof suspicious information, and tracing the original source\nof a report can help slow down a lie, giving the truth more time \nto put on its shoes.

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Jessica Ruby Imagine a place so dark you can't see the nose on your face. Eyes opened or closed, it's all the same because the sun never shines there. Up ahead, you see a light. When you creep in to investigate, a blue light flits around you. \"I could watch this forever,\" you think. But you can't because the mouth of an anglerfish has just sprung open and eaten you alive. You are just one of many creatures at the bottom of the ocean who learn too late to appreciate the power of bioluminescence. Bioluminescence refers to the ability of certain living things to create light. The human body can make stuff like ear wax and toe nails, but these organisms can turn parts of their body into glow sticks. It's like nature made them ready to rave. Why? In one way or another, bioluminescence improves a living thing's chances of survival. Take the firefly. It's ability to glow green helps it attract a mate on a warm, summer night, but it's just one of many living things that can glow. The railroad worm, Phrixothrix hirtus, can light up its body in two colors: red and green. Would you eat something that looks like an airport runway? Neither would any sensible predator. The flashing lights keep the worm safe. Then there's the deep sea shrimp, Acantherphyra purpurea. When it feels threatened, it spews a cloud of glowing goo from its mouth. Who doesn't run the other way when they've just been puked on? Plus, that puke attracts bigger predators who want to eat the shrimp's enemy. So what if you can't bioluminesce? No problem! There are other ways for living things to make bioluminescence work for them, even if they weren't born with the equipment to glow. Let's revisit the anglerfish moments before it tried to eat you. That glowing bait on top of its head? It comes from a pocket of skin called the esca. The esca holds bioluminescent bacteria. The anglerfish can't glow there by itself, so it holds a sack of glowing bacteria instead. Remember the firefly? It can actually make itself glow. Inside its lantern are two chemicals, a luciferin and a luciferase. When firefly luciferase and luciferin mix together in the presence of oxygen and fuel for the cell, called ATP, the chemical reaction gives off energy in the form of light. Once scientists figured out how the firefly creates its luciferase and luciferin, they used genetic engineering to make this light-producing reaction occur inside other living things that can't glow. For example, they inserted the genes, or instructions, for a cell to create firefly luciferase and luciferin into a tobacco plant. Once there, the tobacco plant followed the instructions slipped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree. The beauty of bioluminescence, unlike the light from the sun or an incandescent bulb, is that it's not hot. It takes place in a range of temperatures that don't burn a living thing. And unlike a glow stick, which fades out as the chemicals inside get used up, bioluminescent reactions use replenishable resources. That's one reason engineers are trying to develop bioluminescent trees. Just think, if planted on the side of highways, they could light the way, using only oxygen and other freely available, clean resources to run. Talk about survival advantage! That could help our planet live longer. Do you find yourself thinking of other ways to put bioluminescence to good use? That glow stick you swing at a rave may help you find a mate, but how else can bioluminescence improve your survival? If you start thinking in this way, you have seen the light. "

        "text": "In the spring of 1979, a lab worker\nin Sverdlovsk, USSR removed a clogged air filter\nin the ventilation system and didn’t replace it. His note to the supervisor was never \ntransferred to the official logbook, so when the next shift rolled in, workers simply started\nproduction as usual. Now, in most labs, this would\nhave been a minor mistake. But this lab was \na biological weapons facility producing huge quantities of anthrax— which, if inhaled, can kill \nup to 90% of those it infects. This deadly anthrax powder floated\nout into the sky for hours, causing the largest documented outbreak\nof inhalation anthrax on record and resulting in at least 64 deaths. What happened at Sverdlovsk was a tragedy, and the Soviet bioweapons program \nwas a violation of international law. But these days, it’s not just \nstate-sponsored bioweapons programs that keep biosecurity experts up at night. Nor is anthrax their largest concern. They’re worried about an even more\ndangerous kind of lab leak. Since the 1970s, researchers have been\nmanipulating the DNA of microbes to give them abilities\nthey didn’t have before. This is called “gain of function” work and it includes a huge body\nof scientific research. The majority of this work helps humanity\nwith very little risk, for example, engineered viruses \nare used in vaccine production, gene therapy, and cancer treatments. But within the gain of function realm \nlies an intensely debated sub-field where scientists engineer superbugs. Officially known as \n“enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” these ePPPs are typically variants \nof well-known viruses, such as Ebola or avian influenza that have\nbeen engineered to be, say, more transmissible or more deadly. The stakes of this kind of work\nare much higher: if even one unusually dangerous\nvirus escaped a lab, it could cause a global pandemic. Virologists developing ePPPs argue \nthis research could help us prepare for future pandemics, allowing us to jump start treatments\nand potentially save lives. For example, in the early 2010s, several research teams created \na deadly strain of bird flu with the novel ability to spread \nthrough the air between mammals. Advocates of the project argued\nthat by creating this ePPP, we could learn crucial information about a worst-case-scenario virus \nunder controlled conditions. But many critics argued \nthat it’s unclear whether bird flu would ever evolve in the wild\nas it did in the lab. Consequently, they believed the knowledge\ngained by studying this dangerous virus wasn’t remotely worth the risk \nof creating it in the first place. Both sides of this ongoing debate\nare trying to save lives; they just disagree \non the best way to do it. However, everyone agrees that an ePPP\nlab leak could be catastrophic. Labs that work with dangerous pathogens\nare designed with numerous safety features to protect the scientists who work there,\nas well as the outside world, such as ventilation systems\nthat decontaminate air and airtight “spacesuits”\nwith dedicated oxygen. Sometimes buildings are even nested \ninside each other to prevent natural disasters\nfrom breaching the closed environment. But this technology is expensive\nto build and maintain. And even when our tech doesn't fail, there’s still room for the most common\nkind of mistake: human error. Many human errors are inconsequential: a researcher spills a sample, but quickly disinfects \nthe otherwise well-controlled environment. Other incidents, however,\nare much more concerning. In 2009, a researcher accidentally\nstuck themselves with an Ebola-contaminated needle, endangering their life \nand the lives of those treating them. In 2014, six vials containing the virus\nthat causes smallpox were found in an unsecured storage room \nwhere they’d been forgotten for decades. That same year, a CDC scientist\nunknowingly contaminated a sample of relatively harmless bird flu\nwith a deadly lab-grown variant, and then shipped the contaminated\nsample to the USDA. While these incidents did not\nlead to larger crises, the potentially catastrophic consequences\nof an ePPP leak have convinced many scientists \nthat we should stop this kind of research altogether. But if that doesn’t happen,\nwhat can we do to minimize risk? Well, first, we can work to reduce \nhuman error by examining past mistakes. Some experts have suggested creating\nan international database of leaks, near-misses, and fixes taken \nthat would help labs adapt their protocols to minimize human errors. And a robust, well-funded pandemic \nearly warning system would help protect us \nfrom any disease outbreak— whether it comes\nfrom a lab leak or a natural spillover. Developing the kind of global standards\nand databases necessary for these changes would be difficult— requiring unprecedented international\ncollaboration and transparency. But we need to overcome these hurdles because pandemics don't care\nabout borders or politics. "

        "text": "You’ve found Leonardo Da Vinci’s \nsecret vault, secured by a series of combination locks. Fortunately, your treasure map \nhas three codes: 1210, 3211000, and… hmm. The last one appears to be missing. Looks like you’re gonna have \nto figure it out on your own. There’s something those \nfirst two numbers have in common: they’re what’s called \nautobiographical numbers. This is a special type of number \nwhose structure describes itself. Each of an autobiographical\nnumber’s digits indicates how many times the digit corresponding to that\nposition occurs within the number. The first digit indicates \nthe quantity of zeroes, the second digit indicates \nthe number of ones, the third digit the number of twos, \nand so on until the end. The last lock takes a 10 digit number, and it just so happens that there’s exactly one ten-digit\nautobiographical number. What is it? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Blindly trying different combinations \nwould take forever. So let’s analyze the autobiographical \nnumbers we already have to see what kinds of patterns we can find. By adding all the digits in 1210 together, we get 4 – the total number of digits. This makes sense \nsince each individual digit tells us the number of times a specific \ndigit occurs within the total. So the digits in our \nten-digit autobiographical number must add up to ten. This tells us another important thing – the number can’t have \ntoo many large digits. For example, if it included a 6 and a 7, then some digit would \nhave to appear 6 times, and another digit 7 times– making more than 10 digits. We can conclude \nthat there can be no more than one digit greater than 5 \nin the entire sequence. So out of the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9, only one – if any-- will make the cut. And there will be zeroes in the positions corresponding to the numbers \nthat aren’t used. So now we know that our number\nmust contain at least three zeroes – which also means that the leading \ndigit must be 3 or greater. Now, while this first digit counts \nthe number of zeroes, every digit after it counts how many times\na particular non-zero digit occurs. If we add together \nall the digits besides the first one – and remember, \nzeroes don’t increase the sum – we get a count of how many \nnon-zero digits appear in the sequence, including that leading digit. For example, \nif we try this with the first code, we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits. Now, if we subtract one, we have a count of how many non-zero \ndigits there are after the first digit – two, in our example. Why go through all that? Well, we now know something important: the total quantity of non-zero digits\nthat occur after the first digit is equal to the sum of these digits, \nminus one. And how can you get a distribution\nwhere the sum is exactly 1 greater than the number of non-zero \npositive integers being added together? The only way is for one \nof the addends to be a 2, and the rest 1s. How many 1s? Turns out there can only be two – any more would require additional \ndigits like 3 or 4 to count them. So now we have the leading digit of 3 \nor greater counting the zeroes, a 2 counting the 1s, and two 1s – one to count the 2s and another to count the leading digit. And speaking of that, it’s time to find out \nwhat the leading digit is. Since we know that the 2 \nand the double 1s have a sum of 4, we can subtract that from 10 to get 6. Now it’s just a matter \nof putting them all in place: 6 zeroes, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines. The safe swings open, \nand inside you find... Da Vinci’s long-lost autobiography. "

        "text": "Antibiotics: behind the scenes, \nthey enable much of modern medicine. We use them to cure infectious diseases, but also to safely facilitate everything \nfrom surgery to chemotherapy to organ transplants. Without antibiotics, even routine medical procedures \ncan lead to life-threatening infections. And we’re at risk of losing them. Antibiotics are chemicals \nthat prevent the growth of bacteria. Unfortunately, some bacteria \nhave become resistant to all currently available antibiotics. At the same time, \nwe’ve stopped discovering new ones. Still, there’s hope that we can get ahead \nof the problem. But first, how did we \nget into this situation? The first widely used antibiotic \nwas penicillin, discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. In his 1945 Nobel Prize \nacceptance speech, Fleming warned that bacterial resistance \nhad the potential to ruin the miracle of antibiotics. He was right: in the 1940s and 50s, resistant bacteria \nalready began to appear. From then until the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies \ncountered the problem of resistance by discovering many new antibiotics. At first this was a highly successful— \nand highly profitable— enterprise. Over time, a couple things changed. Newly discovered antibiotics \nwere often only effective for a narrow spectrum of infections, whereas the first ones \nhad been broadly applicable. This isn’t a problem in itself, but it does mean that fewer doses \nof these drugs could be sold— making them less profitable. In the early days, \nantibiotics were heavily overprescribed, including for viral infections \nthey had no effect on. Scrutiny around prescriptions increased, \nwhich is good, but also lowered sales. At the same time, \ncompanies began to develop more drugs that are taken over a patient’s lifetime, like blood pressure \nand cholesterol medications, and later anti-depressants \nand anti-anxiety medications. Because they are taken indefinitely, \nthese drugs more profitable. By the mid-1980s, no new chemical classes \nof antibiotics were discovered. But bacteria continued to acquire \nresistance and pass it along by sharing genetic information \nbetween individual bacteria and even across species. Now bacteria that are resistant \nto many antibiotics are common, and increasingly some strains \nare resistant to all our current drugs. So, what can we do about this? We need to control the use \nof existing antibiotics, create new ones, combat resistance to new \nand existing drugs, and find new ways to fight \nbacterial infections. The largest consumer \nof antibiotics is agriculture, which uses antibiotics not only \nto treat infections but to promote the growth of food animals. Using large volumes of antibiotics increases the bacteria’s exposure \nto the antibiotics and therefore their opportunity \nto develop resistance. Many bacteria that are common in animals, \nlike salmonella, can also infect humans, and drug-resistant versions can pass \nto us through the food chain and spread through international trade \nand travel networks. In terms of finding new antibiotics, nature offers the most promising \nnew compounds. Organisms like other microbes and fungi \nhave evolved over millions of years to live in competitive environments— meaning they often contain \nantibiotic compounds to give them a survival advantage \nover certain bacteria. We can also package antibiotics \nwith molecules that inhibit resistance. One way bacteria develop resistance \nis through proteins of their own that degrade the drug. By packaging the antibiotic with molecules\nthat block the degraders, the antibiotic can do its job. Phages, viruses that attack bacteria \nbut don’t affect humans, are one promising new avenue \nto combat bacterial infections. Developing vaccines for common infections,\nmeanwhile, can help prevent disease \nin the first place. The biggest challenge to all \nthese approaches is funding, which is woefully inadequate \nacross the globe. Antibiotics are so unprofitable \nthat many large pharmaceutical companies have stopped trying to develop them. Meanwhile, smaller companies \nthat successfully bring new antibiotics to market often still go bankrupt, \nlike the American start up Achaogen. New therapeutic techniques \nlike phages and vaccines face the same fundamental problem \nas traditional antibiotics: if they’re working well, \nthey’re used just once, which makes it difficult to make money. And to successfully counteract resistance \nin the long term, we’ll need to use \nnew antibiotics sparingly— lowering the profits \nfor their creators even further. One possible solution is to shift profits \naway from the volume of antibiotics sold. For example, the United Kingdom \nis testing a model where healthcare providers \npurchase antibiotic subscriptions. While governments are looking for ways \nto incentivize antibiotic development, these programs are still \nin the early stages. Countries around the world \nwill need to do much more— but with enough investment \nin antibiotic development and controlled use of our current drugs, we can still get ahead of resistance. "

        "text": "As dawn breaks over Athens, \nPheidias is already late for work. The year is 432 BCE, and he’s the architekton, \nor chief builder, for the Parthenon— \nAthens’ newest and largest temple. When completed, his masterpiece will be \nan enormous shrine to the goddess Athena, and a testament to the glory \nof the Athenians. But when he arrives onsite he finds \nfive epistatai, or city officials, waiting to confront him. They accuse Pheidias of embezzling gold designated for the temple’s \nsacred central statue. He has until sundown to provide \nall the temple’s expenses and account for every flake of gold— \nor face the judgement of the courts. Though he’s insulted by these \nfalse charges, Pheidias isn’t surprised. Pericles, the politician \nwho commissioned the Parthenon, has many enemies in city government, and this project \nis somewhat controversial. The public is expecting a classic temple \nin the Doric style: simple columns supporting \na horizontal entablature, crowned with a triangular roof. But Pheidias’ plans are far more radical \nby Athenian standards. His designs combine Doric columns \nwith a sweeping Ionic frieze, hosting a vast panorama of the city’s \nGreat Panathenaic festival. Not only will this sculpture show \nhumans and gods side by side— something never before seen \nin a temple’s décor— it will also cost much more \nthan the traditional approach. Praying to the Gods that his colleagues \nhave been keeping track of their spending, Pheidias sets off to prove his innocence. First, he checks in with his architects \nIktinos and Callicrates. Rather than using a blueprint, they pore over the syngraphai, \nor general plan, and paradeigma, a 3D model. Without an exact blueprint, the team \noften has to resolve issues in real time, guided only by careful calculation \nand their instinct for symmetry. Maintaining this symmetry \nhas proven especially difficult. The Parthenon is built on a curve \nwith the columns leaning slightly inwards. To project strength, and potentially keep the columns \nlooking straight from a distance, the architects incorporated entasis, \nor slight bulging, in each column. For the temple’s other elements, the team calculates symmetry by employing\nrelatively consistent proportions across the design. But their shifting plans require \nconstant recalculations. After helping solve one such computation, Pheidias collects his colleagues’ \ngold records and heads off to receive \na special delivery. Immense marble blocks for the Parthenon’s \npediment have just arrived from quarries at Mount Pentelikon. The usual ramps would collapse under the weight \nof these 2 to 3 ton stone blocks, so Pheidias orders the construction \nof new pulleys. After recording the additional expense and supervising \nthe construction all afternoon, he finally arrives \nat the sculpture workshop. His sculptors are carving \n92 mythical scenes, or metopes, to decorate the temple. Every carving depicts fighting \nfrom different epic battles— each a mythical representation \nof Greece’s victory over Persia about 40 years earlier. No temple has ever used \nso many metopes before, and each scene adds to the temple’s \nballooning expenses. Finally, Pheidias turns \nto his primary responsibility, and the focal point of the entire temple. Covered in thick layers of gold,\nminutely decorated, and towering above her worshippers, this will be a statue of the city’s \npatron and protector: Athena Parthenos. When the temple is complete, \nthrongs will gather on its perimeter— offering prayers, performing sacrifices, and pouring libations \nfor the goddess of wisdom. Pheidias spends the rest of the day designing finishing touches \nfor the statue, and as the light fades, \nthe epistatai arrive to confront him. After looming over his records, \nthey look up triumphantly. Pheidias may have accounted \nfor the temple’s general spending, but his records show no mention \nof the statue’s gold. At that moment, Pericles himself arrives \nto save his chief builder. The temple’s sponsor tells \nthem that all the gold on the statue can be removed and weighed individually \nto prove Pheidias’ innocence. Assigning laborers to the task— and charging the officials to watch \nthem late into the night— Pheidias and his patron \nleave their adversaries to the mercy of mighty Athena. "

        "text": "Standing at almost 84 meters tall, this is the largest known living tree\non the planet. Nicknamed General Sherman, this giant sequoia has sequestered\nroughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon over its estimated 2,500 years on earth. Very few trees can compete \nwith this carbon impact, but today, humanity produces more \nthan 1,400 tons of carbon every minute. To combat climate change, we need to steeply reduce \nfossil fuel emissions, and draw down excess CO2 \nto restore our atmosphere’s balance of greenhouse gases. But what can trees do to help\nin this fight? And how do they sequester carbon \nin the first place? Like all plants, trees consume\natmospheric carbon through a chemical reaction \ncalled photosynthesis. This process uses energy \nfrom sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide \ninto oxygen and energy-storing carbohydrates. Plants then consume \nthese carbohydrates in a reverse process called respiration, \nconverting them to energy and releasing carbon \nback into the atmosphere. In trees, however, a large portion\nof that carbon isn’t released, and instead, is stored \nas newly formed wood tissue. During their lifetimes, \ntrees act as carbon vaults, and they continue to draw down carbon \nfor as long as they grow. However, when a tree dies\nand decays, some of its carbon will be released\nback into the air. A significant amount of CO2\nis stored in the soil, where it can remain \nfor thousands of years. But eventually, that carbon\nalso seeps back into the atmosphere. So if trees are going to help \nfight a long-term problem like climate change, they need to survive to sequester \ntheir carbon for the longest period possible, \nwhile also reproducing quickly. Is there one type of tree \nwe could plant that meets these criteria? Some fast growing, long-lived, \nsuper sequestering species we could scatter worldwide? Not that we know of. But even if such a tree existed, it wouldn’t be a good \nlong-term solution. Forests are complex networks \nof living organisms, and there’s no one species \nthat can thrive in every ecosystem. The most sustainable trees to plant \nare always native ones; species that already play a role \nin their local environment. Preliminary research shows \nthat ecosystems with a naturally occurring diversity\nof trees have less competition for resources and better resist\nclimate change. This means we can’t just plant trees \nto draw down carbon; we need to restore depleted ecosystems. There are numerous regions\nthat have been clear cut or developed that are ripe for restoring. In 2019, a study led \nby Zurich’s Crowtherlab analyzed satellite imagery \nof the world’s existing tree cover. By combining it with climate and soil data and excluding areas necessary\nfor human use, they determined Earth could support nearly one billion hectares \nof additional forest. That’s roughly 1.2 trillion trees. This staggering number surprised\nthe scientific community, prompting additional research. Scientists now cite a more conservative \nbut still remarkable figure. By their revised estimates,\nthese restored ecosystems could capture anywhere from 100 to 200\nbillion tons of carbon, accounting for over one-sixth\nof humanity’s carbon emissions. More than half of the potential\nforest canopy for new restoration efforts \ncan be found in just six countries. And the study can also provide insight\ninto existing restoration projects, like The Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares\nof forest by 2030. But this is where it gets complicated. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and it’s unclear whether they’re best \nrestored by human intervention. It’s possible the right thing \nto do for certain areas is to simply leave them alone. Additionally, some researchers\nworry that restoring forests on this scale may have unintended \nconsequences, like producing natural bio-chemicals at a pace that could actually \naccelerate climate change. And even if we succeed \nin restoring these areas, future generations would need\nto protect them from the natural and economic forces\nthat previously depleted them. Taken together, these challenges\nhave damaged confidence in restoration projects worldwide. And the complexity \nof rebuilding ecosystems demonstrates how important \nit is to protect our existing forests. But hopefully, restoring \nsome of these depleted regions will give us the data and conviction \nnecessary to combat climate change on a larger scale. If we get it right, maybe these modern\ntrees will have time to grow into carbon carrying titans. "

If you’re lucky\nand avoid being destroyed by antimatter, you'll be the seed of a future galaxy. You gravitate towards a ring of particles\nthat have devised a game. A friendly gluon explains: there are an equal number of matter \nand antimatter particles. At the blow of a cosmic whistle, every particle of matter with a particle \nof antimatter to its immediate right will merge with that anitparticle\nto—poof!— both annihilate. The circle will tighten \nto make a smaller circle, and the process will repeat \nuntil just one particle of matter remains. They’d been waiting for someone like you,\nas with a perfectly balanced setup, no one would be left in the end. As guest of honor, they’ll let you choose \nwhere to insert yourself into the ring. What spot should you choose to make sure\nyou’re the last particle standing? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Explanation in 3 Explanation in 2 Explanation in 1 A general strategy can’t rely on knowing\nwhat the circle looks like. But we can rely on how it should end: \nwith you as the last particle standing. Let's start there and work backwards. Just before this, there were also \nsome matter/antimatter pairs. Here’s 3 for the sake of example. This right away suggests a strategy. You can simulate annihilations \nin any circle by marking all pairs \nof adjacent particles, then the newly adjacent pairs, and so on,\nto reach this final set. If you map them back \nto the original circle, standing to the immediate left \nof those final matter particles or the immediate right \nof final antiparticles means you’ll reach this endgame state \nand survive. So here are the safe spots \nin all three given circles. You find a good position and experience\nthe bittersweet radiance of your new friends pairing off\nand becoming pure energy. You’re soon left alone. But wait a minute! Today’s the big day. You’re an intelligent creature of matter\namidst a chaotic crowd of alien races. Every hundred million years, sentient species of the galaxy \nsend emissaries to the core to pay tribute to the galactic seed \nyou’re all descended from. Each of the 27,182 attendees has brought a cube of matter \nand a cube of antimatter. Except you: you’ve been chosen \nto represent your famed ancestor and reenact its moment of choice. Everyone places their matter \nand antimatter cubes in a ring. Your job: pick a spot to stand \nwhere you won’t be annihilated. The ring is too large to simulate\nannihilations like before, but you have a programmable device\nyou can point at spots between cubes. The device can detect the full sequence\nof cubes around the circle, count cubes of each type,\nperform arithmetic, and carry out simple logical commands. How do you program your device \nto identify safe spots? Pause to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s go back to our earlier approach: running time backwards \nstarting from you alone, then a sequence of pairs of cubes. A second step back produces more pairs\nnestled between existing cubes. As does the next, and the next,\neach adding nestled pairs like a Russian doll \nof fundamental particles. A pair never forms around an existing cube\nbecause only adjacent cubes annihilate. Your survival depends \non the matter particles to your right buffering you from antimatter. We can mathematically model this idea \nwith a sum, starting with your +1. For instance, this would be +1+1-1+1-1. From your perspective, \nno matter how far you look, this sum will be positive. Considering how we introduced pairs, \nthis makes sense— each inserted plus was immediately\nfollowed by a minus. If we examine the starting position\nof any other matter cube, its sum will eventually hit zero. The moment that happens \nmarks its exact annihilation partner. Again, our introduction of pairs \nreflects this; nestled pairs only delay the inevitable\nfor the outer cubes. We can now program the device. Start a running sum with +1,\nrepresenting you, and scan around the circle. For each matter cube, add one, and for each antimatter cube, \nsubtract one. If all 54,364 cubes have been scanned without the sum ever hitting 0, that spot is safe. Nothing left to do \nbut enjoy the fireworks. "

        "text": "In 1776, a powerful empire was\nborn in North America. The Lakotas had reached the Black Hills, the most sacred place and most coveted\nbuffalo hunting grounds in the western plains. Located in what is now South Dakota, \ncontrol of the Black Hills, or Paha Sapa, marked the Lakotas as the dominant power\nin the American West. Just a few decades before, they were vying\nfor power in the eastern woodlands— and losing. One of seven nations, \nor seven council fires, that made up the Sioux Alliance, the Lakotas had lived in the forests\nand wetlands between the Great Lakes \nand the Missouri Valley for centuries. In the 1600s, European colonizers\ndestabilized this region. While some tribes profited by trading\nfurs with new France, the Lakotas lived just out of range\nof the best trade opportunities. So in the early 1700s,\nthey turned their attention west. The western plains were much less fertile\nand abundant than the Lakotas’ homelands. The only easy access to food and water\nwas immediately alongside the rivers— land Arikaras had already claimed. To compete, the Lakotas became \nskilled buffalo hunters and warriors on horseback. They conquered the farming Arikaras, forcing them to pay tributes\nof maize and squash. When the Spanish arrived expecting\nto find lucrative trading grounds, they had to pay tolls \nto the Lakotas instead. In 1804, a new spectacle came floating\nup the Missouri River: Merriwether Lewis and William Clark. Lakota chief Black Buffalo refused to let\nthem pass until they paid a hefty tribute. In spite of this rocky start, the expedition marked the beginning\nof a close trade alliance between the Lakotas and the United States. Lakota men hunted buffalo, while women\nprocessed the hides into robes for trade. The US government supplied guns,\nammunition, and other goods, even providing Lakotas with smallpox\nvaccines that protected them from the deadly epidemics that ravaged\nother Native American nations. On paper, the United States had acquired\nthe Lakotas’ lands from France in the Louisiana Purchase. But the Lakotas would not cede their lands because of an agreement \nbetween two foreign powers. Though there were 15,000 Lakotas\nand 23 million Americans, the bulk of US population and military\nmight was concentrated on the east coast. Just getting an army to Lakota territory\npresented a huge expense, and once there they would face \nformidable warriors with deep local knowledge and alliances. To avoid a war it couldn’t afford \nand wouldn’t win, the US government attempted to appease \nthe Lakotas, paying steep tributes of ammunition \nand rations demanded by Lakota leaders. So while almost all the Native Americans\nin North America were being forced off their lands \nand onto reservations, the Lakota Empire was still expanding. By 1850, they controlled \nsome 500,000 square kilometers. They were spread thinly\nacross this vast area, moving their villages \nin pursuit of Buffalo. Though there was no central authority, the leaders of bands, or oyates, \ncame together at annual Sun Dances to strategize and coordinate complex\ndiplomatic operations. Lasting a few weeks each summer, Sun Dances were spiritual ceremonies \nthat reaffirmed communal ties, appeased Wakan Tanka, the Great Spirit,\nand kept the world in balance. Starting in 1849, the California gold rush\nbrought hordes of white settlers west, encroaching on Lakota territory\nand disturbing the buffalo herds. Lakota leaders correctly interpreted\nthis migration as a signal that the US no longer intended \nto respect their claim to the land. In retaliation, they attacked wagon trains\nand government offices. As the conflict grew, Chief Red Cloud\nnegotiated in Washington DC. While back in Lakota territory, chiefs \nSitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and others prepared for battle. They mobilized their Cheyenne \nand Arapaho allies and almost all the other Sioux nations \nagainst the US. In 1876, exactly 100 years after\nthe Lakotas’ arrival, gold prospectors occupied \nthe sacred Black Hills. For many Lakotas, \nthis was the final straw. Following a vision by Sitting Bull, \nCrazy Horse led Lakota forces to decisively defeat the Americans \nin the Battle of the Little Bighorn. After this victory, the Lakotas\nfaced an even graver threat: wagon travel and railroad construction\nhad decimated buffalo populations, and they faced starvation. To survive, they moved on to reservations, where the authorities murdered \nSitting Bull and Crazy Horse and attempted to dismantle their culture, \nprohibiting the Sun Dance on reservations. The Lakotas started a protest movement\ncalled the Ghost Dance. Alarmed by this resistance, in 1890,\nthe US Army massacred hundreds of Lakotas, many of them women and children,\nat Wounded Knee Creek. Today, Lakotas continue to fight \nfor their culture and their land. In 2016, they drew supporters worldwide\nto protest construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline \nthrough their reservation, continuing a long history of resistance to a government\nknown for breaking its promises.

        "text": "Arriving home after a long day, you settle\nin for a quiet evening alone. But instead of the sound of silence, \nyou hear a constant ringing— even though there’s nothing \nmaking any noise. What you’re experiencing \nis called tinnitus, the perception of a noise like ringing, \nbuzzing, hissing or clicking that occurs without any external source \nof sound. Tinnitus has been bothering humanity \nsince Ancient Babylon, plaguing everyone from Leonardo da Vinci \nto Charles Darwin. Today, roughly one in seven people \nworldwide experiences this auditory sensation. So where does this persistent sound \ncome from? When you normally hear something, \nsound waves hit various areas of your ear, creating vibrations that displace fluid \ninside the cochlea. If the vibrations are large enough, they elicit a chemical response \nthat transforms them into bioelectrical signals. These nerve impulses are then relayed \nthrough the hearing pathway to the brain, where they result \nin the sounds we perceive. However, in the vast majority \nof tinnitus cases, the nerve signals that produce \nthese mysterious sounds don’t travel through your ear at all. Instead, they’re generated internally, \nby your own central nervous system. Under usual circumstances, \nthese self-produced signals are an essential part of hearing. All mammals demonstrate \non-going neural activity throughout their hearing pathways. When there are no sounds present, this activity is at a baseline \nthat establishes your neural code for silence. When a sound does appear, \nthis activity changes, allowing the brain to distinguish \nbetween silence and sound. But the auditory system’s health \ncan affect this background signal. Loud noises, diseases, toxins, \nand even natural aging can damage your cochlear cells. Some of these may heal \nin a matter of hours. However, if enough cells die, \neither over time or all at once, the auditory system becomes \nless sensitive. With fewer cochlear cells \nrelaying information, incoming sounds generate \nweaker nerve signals. And many environmental sounds \ncan be lost completely. To compensate, your brain devotes more \nenergy to monitoring the hearing pathway. Just like you might adjust \nthe knobs of a radio, the brain modifies neural activity \nwhile also tweaking the tuning knob to get a clearer signal. Increasing this background neural activity\nis intended to help you process weak auditory inputs. But it can also modify \nyour baseline for silence— such that a lack of sound \nno longer sounds silent at all. This is called subjective tinnitus, and it accounts for the vast majority \nof tinnitus cases. Subjective tinnitus \nis a symptom associated with practically every known ear disorder, but it isn’t necessarily a bad thing. While its appearance can be surprising, subjective tinnitus has no inherently \nnegative consequences. But for some, tinnitus episodes \ncan trigger traumatic memories or otherwise distressing feelings, which increase the sound’s intrusiveness. This psychological loop often leads \nto what’s known as “bothersome tinnitus,\" a condition that can exacerbate \nthe symptoms of PTSD, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. There’s no known cure \nfor subjective tinnitus. So the most important thing \ndoctors can do is help people understand \nthis auditory event, and develop neutral associations \nwith these often-distressing sounds. For example, sound therapy uses noises \nlike rain, birdsong, or music to mask tinnitus and reduce stress. One form, called informational masking, \nuses soothing, complex auditory signals that distract the brain \nfrom the tinnitus sound. Another, called energetic masking, uses sounds with the same frequency \nas the patient’s tinnitus to occupy the neurons that would \notherwise deliver the tinnitus signal. Practiced alongside counseling, these interventions allow \npeople to re-evaluate their relationship with tinnitus. Losing the sound of silence \ncan be troubling to say the least. Tinnitus reveals that your brain is \nconstantly analyzing the world around you, even as it fails to filter \nits own internal noise. In a sense, experiencing tinnitus is like eavesdropping \non your brain talking to itself— though it may not be a conversation \nyou want to hear. "

        "text": "If you line up the entire text \nof “Moby Dick,” which was published in 1851, into a giant rectangle, you may notice some peculiar patterns: like these words, which seem to predict the assassination\nof Martin Luther King. Or these references \nto the 1997 death of Princess Di. So, was Herman Melville a secret prophet? The answer is no, and we know that thanks to a mathematical\nprinciple called Ramsey theory. It's the reason we can find geometric\nshapes in the night sky, it's why we can know without checking that at least two people in London have exactly the same number \nof hairs on their head, and it explains why patterns can be found\nin just about any text... even Vanilla Ice lyrics. So what is Ramsey theory? Simply put, it states that given enough\nelements in a set or structure, some particular interesting pattern\namong them is guaranteed to emerge. As a simple example, let’s look \nat what’s called the Party Problem— a classic illustration of Ramsey theory. Suppose there are at least six people\nat a party. Amazingly enough, we can say for sure that some group of three of them\neither all know each other, or have never met before, without knowing a single thing about them. We can demonstrate that by graphing\nout all the possibilities. Each point represents a person, and a line indicates \nthat the pair know each other. Every pair only has two possibilities:\nthey either know each other or they don't. There are a lot of possibilities, but every single one has the property \nthat we're looking for. Six is the lowest number of guests\nwhere that's guaranteed to be the case, which we can express like this. Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee that such a minimum number exists\nfor certain patterns, but no easy way to find it. In this case, as the total number\nof guests grows higher, the combinations get out of control. For instance, say you're trying\nto find out the minimum size of a party where there's a group of five people\nwho all know each other or all don't. Despite five being a small number, the answer is virtually \nimpossible to discover through an exhaustive search like this. That's because of the sheer \nvolume of possibilities. A party with 48 guests has 2^(1128) possible configurations, more than the number of atoms \nin the universe. Even with the help of computers, the best we know is that the answer\nto this question is somewhere between 43 and 49 guests. What this shows us \nis that specific patterns with seemingly astronomical odds can emerge from a relatively small set. And with a very large set,\nthe possibilities are almost endless. Any four stars where no three \nlie in a straight line will form some quadrilateral shape. Expand that to the thousands \nof stars we can see in the sky, and it's no surprise that we can\nfind all sorts of familiar shapes, and even creatures if we look for them. So what are the chances of a text\nconcealing a prophecy? Well, when you factor\nin  the number of letters, the variety of possible related words, and all their abbreviations \nand alternate spellings, they're pretty high. You can try it yourself. Just pick a favorite text, arrange the letters in a grid, and see what you can find. The mathematician T.S. Motzkin \nonce remarked that, “while disorder is more probable \nin general, complete disorder is impossible.\" The sheer size of the universe guarantees\nthat some of its random elements will fall into specific arrangements, and because we evolved to notice patterns\nand pick out signals among the noise, we are often tempted to find intentional\nmeaning where there may not be any. So while we may be awed by hidden messages\nin everything from books, to pieces of toast, to the night sky, their real origin \nis usually our own minds. "

As of 2020, it takes 3 trillion watts\nto power the entire world. But almost a billion people don’t have\naccess to reliable electricity. As countries become more industrialized\nand more people join the grid, electricity demand is expected \nto increase about 80% by 2050. That number isn't the complete picture. We'll also have to use electricity\nin completely new ways. Right now, we power a lot of things\nby burning fossil fuels, emitting an unsustainable amount \nof greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. We’ll have to eliminate \nthese emissions entirely to ensure a sustainable future \nfor humanity. The first step to doing so,\nfor many industries, is to switch from fossil fuels \nto electric power. We'll need to electrify cars, switch buildings heated by natural gas\nfurnaces to electric heat pumps, and electrify the huge amount of heat\nused in industrial processes. So all told, global electricity needs\ncould triple by 2050. We’ll also need all that electricity \nto come from clean energy sources if it’s going to solve the problems \ncaused by fossil fuels. Today, only one third of the electricity\nwe generate comes from clean sources. Fossil fuels are cheap and convenient, \neasy to ship, and easy to turn into electricity \non demand. So how can we close the gap? Wind and solar power work great\nfor places with lots of wind and sunshine, but we can’t store and ship sunlight \nor wind the way we can transport oil. To make full use of energy from these \nsources at other times or in other places, we’d have to store it in batteries and improve our power grid infrastructure\nto transport it long distances. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants \nuse nuclear fission to generate carbon-free electricity. Though still more expensive\nthan plants that burn fossil fuels, they can be built anywhere and don’t depend on intermittent \nenergy sources like the sun or wind. Researchers are currently working \nto improve nuclear waste disposal and the safety of nuclear plants. There’s another possibility we’ve been \ntrying to crack since the 1940s: nuclear fusion. It involves smashing light atoms together,\nso they fuse, and harnessing the energy this releases. Accidents aren't a concern\nwith nuclear fusion, and it doesn't produce the long-lived\nradioactive waste fission does. It also doesn’t have \nthe transport concerns associated with wind, solar, \nand other renewable energy sources. A major breakthrough here could\nrevolutionize clean energy. The same is true of nuclear fission, \nsolar, and wind. Breakthroughs in any \nof these technologies, and especially in all of them together,\ncan change the world: not only helping us triple \nour electricity supply, but enabling us to sustain it. "

        "text": "In the 1930s, American industrialist \nHenry Ford had one overwhelming obsession: soybeans. He extracted their oil to make enamel \nfor painting his cars. He crushed them into powder\nto make plastic parts. And he encouraged American farmers \nto grow as much of the plant as possible. But he wasn’t just feeding soy \nto machines. At the Chicago World’s Fair,\nhe hosted a soy-centric feast. The ingredient had been a staple\nin Asian cuisine for centuries, but Ford’s dinner— full of soy substitutes\nfor dairy, meat and wheat— took the integration of soy\ninto food a step further. Today, soy is in so many foods \nthat most people consume it every day without even knowing it. So what makes soybeans so versatile? And is our global obsession\nhealthy or harmful? Soybeans have been cultivated in Asia\nas early as 5,500 years ago, but since then they’ve spread \nacross the globe. Part of soy’s success is that \nthe crop can be grown easily and cheaply in variable conditions. And once they’re grown, soybeans have an incredibly high density\nof proteins and fats; ingredients which in recent years\nhave been used in everything from mayonnaise to biodegradable plastic. The ideal method\nfor separating these components depends on what you’re trying to extract. To isolate soy proteins, dehulled beans \nare sometimes pressed through rollers to create thin flakes, and then steeped \nin water to draw out the proteins. Alternatively, whole beans can be simply\nsoaked and ground into a whitish, protein rich liquid. In both cases, the resulting substance \ncan be used to make spongy foods like tofu or filtered to produce soymilk. And at the industrial scale, these proteins can be used in various ways\nto help make processed foods. Soy fats may be even more versatile. In one extraction method, soybeans are dried, cleaned, \nand then fed into an extruder. This machine simultaneously heats\nand presses the beans, producing a liquid containing soy oil\nand other fatty components. By adding water and spinning the mixture,\ncomponents are separated into two parts: refined soy oil for things like salad\ndressing, and a substance called lecithin. Lecithin is made of molecules\ncalled phospholipids, which have a phosphate head that attracts\nwater and a tail that attracts fats. These features make phospholipids\nexcellent for blending ingredients that naturally separate from each other. This process is called emulsification and soy lecithins are used \nas an emulsifying agent in a huge variety of foods. For example, during chocolate production phospholipids attach to both the fatty\ncomponents of the cocoa butter and the water-soluble sugar particles, making them easier to combine\ninto a smooth mixture. A similar process happens \nin powdered products that need to be instantly rehydrated. Soy lecithin bonds with the water and helps the powder \ndisperse more quickly. While there are other plants \nwe can process for lecithin and proteins, soy’s mild taste \nand widespread availability have earned it a place \nin thousands of food products. But is it unhealthy to be eating\nthis much soy? Not really. Soybeans contain many of the essential\namino acids our bodies need, making them one of the best ways \nto get these proteins without eating meat. And the beans’ fat content is largely\nmade up of so-called “good” fats— poly and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, which can decrease cholesterol \nand reduce the risk of heart disease. There are some compounds in soy that may inhibit our body’s absorption\nof various minerals. And about 0.3% of the general population\nhas a soy allergy, which can be severe in rare cases. But for many people, the biggest complaint\nabout soy consumption is the occasional increase in flatulence. Outside our bodies however,\nsoy is much more worrying. To accommodate the soy farms needed\nfor heavy industry, processed foods and livestock feed, \nhuge swaths of land have been deforested. Between 2006 and 2017, roughly\n22,000 square kilometers of the Amazon were cleared for soy production. In some regions, this has also led\nto the displacement of farmers and indigenous communities. So if we want to keep using soy\nand all its byproducts, we’ll need to find a way \nto do it humanely and sustainably. "

        "text": "A banker in London sends the latest stock info to his colleagues in Hong Kong in less than a second. With a single click, a customer in New York orders electronics made in Beijing, transported across the ocean within days by cargo plane or container ship. The speed and volume at which goods and information move across the world today is unprecedented in history. But global exchange itself is older than we think, reaching back over 2,000 years along a 5,000 mile stretch known as the Silk Road. The Silk Road wasn't actually a single road, but a network of multiple routes that gradually emerged over centuries, connecting to various settlements and to each other thread by thread. The first agricultural civilizations were isolated places in fertile river valleys, their travel impeded by surrounding geography and fear of the unknown. But as they grew, they found that the arid deserts and steps on their borders were inhabited, not by the demons of folklore, but nomadic tribes on horseback. The Scythians, who ranged from Hungary to Mongolia, had come in contact with the civilizations of Greece, Egypt, India and China. These encounters were often less than peaceful. But even through raids and warfare, as well as trade and protection of traveling merchants in exchange for tariffs, the nomads began to spread goods, ideas and technologies between cultures with no direct contact. One of the most important strands of this growing web was the Persian Royal Road, completed by Darius the First in the 5th century BCE. Stretching nearly 2,000 miles from the Tigris River to the Aegean Sea, its regular relay points allowed goods and messages to travel at nearly 1/10 the time it would take a single traveler. With Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia, and expansion into Central Asia through capturing cities like Samarkand, and establishing new ones like Alexandria Eschate, the network of Greek, Egyptian, Persian and Indian culture and trade extended farther east than ever before, laying the foundations for a bridge between China and the West. This was realized in the 2nd century BCE, when an ambassador named Zhang Qian, sent to negotiate with nomads in the West, returned to the Han Emperor with tales of sophisticated civilizations, prosperous trade and exotic goods beyond the western borders. Ambassadors and merchants were sent towards Persia and India to trade silk and jade for horses and cotton, along with armies to secure their passage. Eastern and western routes gradually linked together into an integrated system spanning Eurasia, enabling cultural and commercial exhange farther than ever before. Chinese goods made their way to Rome, causing an outflow of gold that led to a ban on silk, while Roman glassware was highly prized in China. Military expeditions in Central Asia also saw encounters between Chinese and Roman soldiers. Possibly even transmitting crossbow technology to the Western world. Demand for exotic and foreign goods and the profits they brought, kept the strands of the Silk Road in tact, even as the Roman Empire disintegrated and Chinese dynasties rose and fell. Even Mongolian hoards, known for pillage and plunder, actively protected the trade routes, rather than disrupting them. But along with commodities, these routes also enabled the movement of traditions, innovations, ideologies and languages. Originating in India, Buddhism migrated to China and Japan to become the dominant religion there. Islam spread from the Arabian Penninsula into South Asia, blending with native beliefs and leading to new faiths, like Sikhism. And gunpowder made its way from China to the Middle East forging the futures of the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughul Empires. In a way, the Silk Road's success led to its own demise as new maritime technologies, like the magnetic compass, found their way to Europe, making long land routes obsolete. Meanwhile, the collapse of Mongol rule was followed by China's withdrawal from international trade. But even though the old routes and networks did not last, they had changed the world forever and there was no going back. Europeans seeking new maritime routes to the riches they knew awaited in East Asia led to the Age of Exploration and expansion into Africa and the Americas. Today, global interconnectedness shapes our lives like never before. Canadian shoppers buy t-shirts made in Bangladesh, Japanese audiences watch British television shows, and Tunisians use American software to launch a revolution. The impact of globalization on culture and economy is indisputable. But whatever its benefits and drawbacks, it is far from a new phenomenon. And though the mountains, deserts and oceans that once separated us are now circumvented through super sonic vehicles, cross-continental communication cables, and signals beamed through space rather than caravans traveling for months, none of it would have been possible without the pioneering cultures whose efforts created the Silk Road: history's first world wide web.

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Picture this: your friend and you are watching a sitcom and a sassy sidekick walks into a room, carrying a four-tiered wedding cake. He trips, falls, and face-plants into the cake. Your friend doubles over with laughter and says, \"It's so ridiculous! So ironic!\" Well, quick, what do you do? Do you laugh along with the laugh track and let this grievous misinterpretation of irony go? Or, do you throw caution to the wind and explain the true meaning of irony? If you're me, you choose the latter. Unfortunately, irony has been completely misunderstood. We tend to throw out that term whenever we see something funny or coincidental. And while many examples of true irony can be funny, that is not the driving factor of being ironic. A situation is only ironic if what happens is the exact opposite of what was expected. If you expect A, but get B, then you have irony. Let's take the slap-stick cake situation as an example. When someone walks in precariously balancing something that shouldn't be carried alone, trips, falls, and makes a mess, it is funny, but it's not ironic. In fact, you probably expect someone who is single-handedly carrying a huge cake to trip. When he does, reality aligns with expectations, and so that is not irony. But what if the sassy sidekick walked in wearing a gold medal that he'd won at the cake walking event at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996? What if that sidekick was a professional cake carrier? Then, maybe there would have been a reasonable expectation that he would have been more skilled when carrying a ridiculously large cake. Then, when that reasonable expectation was not met by the tripping sidekick, irony would have been exemplified. Another example. A senior citizen texting and blogging. The common and reasonable expectation of more mature men and women is that they don't like or know technology, that they have a hard time turning on a computer, or that they have the old brick cell phones from the 1980s. One should not expect them to be connected, high-tech, or savvy enough to text or to be blogging, which must seem like some sort of newfangled thing that \"back in my day,\" they never had. So when Granny pulls out her smart phone to post pictures of her dentures or her grandkids, irony ensues. Reasonable expectations of the situation are not met. That is irony. So while the cake dropper might not be ironic, there are all kinds of situations in life that are. Go out, and find those true examples of irony. "

Now you must apprehend them quickly \nbefore their reinforcements arrive. Of course, the rebels won’t just stay put. They’ll try to dodge you\nby moving from planet to planet. But you have one major advantage. Every hour, your state-of-the-art cruiser \ncan warp between any two planets, while their beat-up smuggling ship can only jump to an adjacent planet \nin that same time. These rebels don’t like to stay put. Every time they can relocate, they will. Your scouts tell you that the approaching\nrebel fleet is 10 hours away. You can’t risk letting the rebels escape. Can you devise a sequence \nfor searching the planets that’s guaranteed to catch them \nin 10 warps or less, no matter what moves they make? Rounding up the rebels won’t be easy. For one, you have no way of knowing which \nplanet they’re on to begin with. And without that information, it’s hard \nto determine where they’ll move next. So where do you begin? When tackling problems of this kind \nit often helps to simplify things, so you can better understand \ntheir dynamics. Let’s imagine that this cluster \nhas the same arrangement but no outermost planets,\nleaving only the four in the center. We still don’t know which planet \nthe rebels start on. But there’s one key feature: the third planet \nis adjacent to all others, which means the rebels either start there \nand move somewhere else, or start on one of the other planets and have no choice \nbut to move to planet three. Simply checking planet three\ntwice in a row would do the trick. Adding the three outer planet \nadds a bit more complexity, but the same strategy remains. We want to check the planets in an order \nthat will eventually corner the rebels. And there’s another insight \nthat can help us: each hour, the rebels move from \nan even-numbered planet to an odd-numbered planet, or vice versa. This gives us a way \nto simplify the problem by dividing the planets into two subsets, and tackling each one separately. For starters, let’s assume the rebels \nbegin on an even-numbered planet: either two, four, or six. So we’ll search planet two first. If they’re not there, they must have \nstarted on either four or six. which means they can move to three, five, or seven. Planet three at the center gives them \nthe most options for their next move, so we’ll want to check there next. If we don’t find them, they must have been\nat planet five or seven, meaning they’ll next move to four or six. Let’s now search planet four. If they’re not there, they must have gone \nto the sixth planet and can only flee to three or seven. If we next scour planet three \nand don’t find them, we know they went to planet seven \nand are now cornered. They can only move to planet six, where\nwe’ll apprehend them on our fifth search. Of course, this plan only works assuming that the rebels were on \nan even-numbered planet in the first hour. But what if that assumption was wrong? In that case, they must’ve started \non an odd-numbered planet. And because they move to an adjacent \nplanet every hour, their location must alternate between\nodd and even-numbered planets. This means that if they were on \nan odd-numbered planet to start, after five moves, they'd be \non an even-numbered planet. So if our first five searches missed them because our assumption that they started \non an even-numbered planet was wrong, all we have to do now \nis repeat the sequence! Searching the planets in order two, three, four, three, six, two, three, four, three, six, leaves the rebels nowhere to run. Thanks to your deductive reasoning, \norder is restored to the galaxy. "

        "text": "In the 13th Century, Genghis Khan embarked on a mission\nto take over Eurasia, swiftly conquering countries and drawing \nthem into his expanding Mongol Empire. With his vast armies he became almost \nunstoppable. But, legend has it that there was \none obstacle that even the impressive Khan couldn’t \novercome: A towering wall of ice, grown by locals across a mountain pass to stop the Khan’s armies from \ninvading their territory. No one knows how historically accurate \nthat particular story is, but remarkably, it draws on fact: For centuries, in the Karakoram \nand Himalayan mountain ranges, people have been growing glaciers \nand using these homemade bodies of ice as sources of drinking water and \nirrigation for their crops. But before we get to that fascinating \nphenomenon, it’s important to understand the \ndifference between glaciers that grow in the wild, and those that humans create. In the wild, glaciers require three conditions to grow: Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time. First, a great deal of snow falls and \naccumulates. Cold temperatures then ensure that the \nstacked up snow persists throughout the winter, spring, \nsummer, and fall. Over the following years, decades, \nand centuries, the pressure of the accumulated snow transforms layers into highly compacted \nglacial ice. Artificially growing a glacier, however, is completely different. At the confluence of three great \nmountain ranges, the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, some local cultures have believed for\ncenturies that glaciers are alive. And what’s more, that certain glaciers can have different \ngenders including male and female. Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers\nby grafting together—or marrying— fragments of ice from male and \nfemale glaciers, then covering them with charcoal, \nwheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce. Under their protective coverings, these glacierets transform into fully \nactive glaciers that grow each year with \nadditional snowfall. Those then serve as lasting \nreserves of water that farmers can use \nto irrigate their crops. These practices have spread \nto other cultures, where people are creating their own \nversions of glaciers and applying them to solve serious \nmodern challenges around water supplies. Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region\nin northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the \nHimalayas and receives on average fewer than ten \ncentimeters of rain per year. As local glaciers shrink because \nof climate change, regional water scarcity is increasing. And so, local people have started growing \ntheir own glaciers as insurance against this uncertainty. These glaciers come in two types: \nhorizontal, and vertical. Horizontal glaciers are formed when \nfarmers redirect glacier meltwater into channels and pipes, then carefully siphon it off into a series\nof basins made from stones and earth. Villagers minutely control the release of \nwater into these reservoirs, waiting for each new layer to freeze before filling the basin \nwith another wave. In early spring, these frozen pools begin to melt, supplying villagers with \nirrigation for their fields. Local people make vertical glaciers using \nthe meltwater from already-existing glaciers \nhigh above their villages. The meltwater enters channels \nthat run downhill, flowing until it reaches a crop site where it bursts forth from a pipe pointing\nstraight into the air. When winter temperatures dip, this water freezes as it arcs \nout of the pipe, ultimately forming a 50 meter ice \nsculpture called a stupa, shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone. This inverted form minimizes the amount\nof surface area it exposes to the sun in the spring and summer. That ensures that the mini-glacier \nmelts slowly and provides a reliable supply of water \nto feed the farmers’ crops. These methods may be ancient, but they’re becoming more relevant as climate change takes its \ntoll on our planet. In fact, people are now growing their own\nglaciers in many regions beyond Ladakh. Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier \ngrowing technology, created their first stupa in 2016 \nin the Swiss Alps. There are plans for over 100 more in \nvillages in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness\nour homegrown glaciers well enough to build whole walls of ice– this time not for keeping people out, but to enable life in some of the planet’s\nharshest landscapes.

        "text": "In the mid-1930s, two familiar spires\ntowered above the morning fog. Stretching 227 meters into the sky, these 22,000-ton towers would help support\nCalifornia’s Golden Gate Bridge. But since they were currently\nin Pennsylvania, they first had to be dismantled,\npackaged, and shipped piece by piece over 4,500 kilometers away. Moving the bridge’s towers \nacross a continent was just one of the challenges \nfacing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the project's lead engineers. Even before construction began, \nthe pair faced all kinds of opposition. The military feared the bridge \nwould make the important harbor an even more vulnerable target. Ferry companies claimed the bridge\nwould steal their business, and residents wanted to preserve\nthe area's natural scenery. Worse still, many engineers thought\nthe project was impossible. The Golden Gate Strait was home \nto 96-kilometer-per-hour winds, swirling tides, an endless blanket of fog, and the earthquake-prone \nSan Andreas fault. But Strauss was convinced \nthe bridge could be built; and that it would provide \nSan Francisco’s commuters more reliable passage to the city. He was, however, a bit out of his depth. Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait\nused a cantilever bridge. This kind of bridge consists \nof a single beam anchored at one end and extended horizontally\nlike a diving board. Since these bridges can only extend so far\nbefore collapsing under their own weight, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers,\nlinked by a structure in the middle. But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif\nconvinced Strauss to pursue a different approach:\nthe suspension bridge. Where a cantilever bridge is supported\nfrom one end a suspension bridge suspends its deck\nfrom cables strung across the gap. The result is a more flexible structure that’s resilient to winds \nand shifting loads. This kind of design had long been used \nfor small rope bridges. And in the 1930s, \nadvanced steel manufacturing could create cables of bundled wire \nto act as strong steel rope for large-scale construction. At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest \nsuspension bridge ever attempted, and its design was only possible\ndue to these innovations. But cables and towers of this size \ncould only be built at large steelworks on the country’s east coast. While the recently completed Panama Canal made it possible to ship these components\nto California, reassembling the towers on site \ndidn’t go quite as smoothly. It was relatively easy to find a stable,\nshallow foundation for the north tower. But building the south tower \nessentially required erecting a ten-story building underwater. Since the strait’s depth prevented them\ndrilling or digging the foundations, bombs were dropped on the ocean floor,\ncreating openings for pouring concrete. A seawall was built to protect the site\nfrom powerful currents, and workers operated in 20-minute shifts\nbetween tides. The towers had so many compartments\nthat each worker carried a set of plans to prevent getting lost. And at one point, an earthquake rocked\nthe south tower nearly 5 meters in each direction. Strauss took worker safety very seriously,\nrequiring hard hats at all times and stretching a safety net \nbelow the towers. But not even these precautions \ncould prevent an entire scaffolding platform\nfrom falling in 1937, carrying ten workers to their deaths. Once the towers were complete, \nworkers spun the cables in place, hung suspenders at 50-foot intervals,\nand laid down the concrete roadway. The bridge was finished,\nbut there was still one more task ahead: painting it. After production, the steel had been \ncoated with a reddish paint primer it maintained throughout construction. But the Navy had been pushing hard to paint the bridge \na tactical black and yellow. Consulting architect Irving Morrow \nactually thought the primer itself paired nicely with the strait’s \nnatural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone. Citing numerous letters from locals, Morrow’s 30-page pitch \nto paint the bridge “international orange” beat out the Navy’s plans. And today, this iconic color \nstill complements the strait’s blue water, green hills, \nand rolling fog. "

        "text": "If you were buying a car in 1899, you would’ve had three major\noptions to choose from. You could buy a steam-powered car. Typically relying on gas-powered boilers, \nthese could drive as far as you wanted— provided you also wanted to lug\naround extra water to refuel and didn’t mind waiting 30 minutes\nfor your engine to heat up. Alternatively, you could buy\na car powered by gasoline. However, the internal combustion engines\nin these models required dangerous hand-cranking to start and emitted loud noises\nand foul-smelling exhaust while driving. So your best bet was probably\noption number three: a battery-powered electric vehicle. These cars were quick to start,\nclean and quiet to run, and if you lived somewhere with access \nto electricity, easy to refuel overnight. If this seems like an easy choice,\nyou're not alone. By the end of the 19th century, \nnearly 40% of American cars were electric. In cities with early electric systems, battery-powered cars were \na popular and reliable alternative to their occasionally explosive \ncompetitors. But electric vehicles had one\nmajor problem— batteries. Early car batteries were expensive\nand inefficient. Many inventors, including Thomas Edison, tried to build batteries \nthat stored more electricity. Others even built exchange stations \nin urban areas to swap out dead batteries for charged ones. But these measures weren’t enough to allow\nelectric vehicles to make long trips. And at over twice the price \nof a gas-powered car, many couldn’t afford these luxury items. At the same time, oil discoveries\nlowered the price of gasoline, and new advances made internal combustion\nengines more appealing. Electric starters removed the need\nfor hand-cranking, mufflers made engines quieter and \nrubber engine mounts reduced vibration. In 1908, Ford released the Model T; a cheap, high-quality gas-powered car \nthat captured the public imagination. By 1915, the percentage of electric cars\non the road had plummeted. For the next 55 years, internal combustion\nengines ruled the roads. Aside from some special-purpose vehicles,\nelectric cars were nowhere to be found. However, in the 1970s, \nthe tide began to turn. US concerns about oil availability renewed\ninterest in alternative energy sources. And studies in the 1980s linking \ncar emissions with smog in cities like Los Angeles encouraged governments \nand environmental organizations to reconsider electric vehicles. At this point, car companies had spent\ndecades investing in internal combustion engines \nwithout devoting any resources to solving the century-old \nbattery problem. But other companies were developing\nincreasingly efficient batteries to power a new wave \nof portable electronics. By the 1990s, energy dense nickel metal\nhydride batteries were on the market, soon followed by lithium-ion batteries. Alongside regulatory mandates \nby California to reduce smog, these innovations sparked a small wave\nof new electric vehicles, including hybrid cars. Hybrids aren’t true electric vehicles; their nickel metal hydride batteries are only used to optimize \nthe efficiency of gas-burning engines. But in 2008, Tesla Motors went further, grabbing the attention of consumers, \nautomakers, and regulators with its lithium-ion-powered Roadster. This purely electric vehicle could travel \nmore than 320 kilometers on a single charge, almost doubling the previous record. Since then, electric vehicles have \nvastly improved in cost, performance, efficiency, and availability. They can accelerate much faster\nthan gas-powered sports cars, and while some models still\nhave a high upfront cost, they reliably save their drivers money\nin the long run. As governments around the world focus \non slowing climate change, electric vehicles are now expected \nto replace gas-powered ones altogether. In Norway, 75% of car sales in 2020 \nwere plug-in electric vehicles. And policies such as California’s\nZero Emission Vehicle mandate and Europe’s aggressive \nCO2 emission standards have dramatically slowed investments \nin gas-powered vehicles worldwide. Soon, electric cars will reclaim \ntheir place on the road, putting gasoline in our rearview. "

        "text": "Two sisters take the same DNA test. The results show that one sister \nis 10% French, the other 0%. Both sisters share the same two parents, and therefore the same set \nof ancestors. So how can one be 10% more French \nthan the other? Tests like these rely on our DNA \nto answer questions about our ancestry, but our DNA actually \ncan’t tell us everything about who we are or where we’re from. DNA tests are great \nat answering some questions, like who your parents are, but \ncan provide baffling results to others, like whether you have ancestors \nfrom a particular region. To understand why, it helps to know where\nour DNA comes from in the first place. Each person’s DNA consists \nof about 6 billion base pairs stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes—\n46 total. That may seem like a dizzying amount \nof information, but 99% of our genome \nis shared among all humans. The remaining 1% contains everything\ndistinct about an individual’s ancestry. Commercial DNA tests utilize \nless than 1% of that 1%. One chromosome in each pair \ncomes from each parent. These halves join at conception: \nwhen a sperm and egg, each with only 23 chromosomes, \ncombine. The story of our ancestry becomes\nmuddled before conception. That’s because the 23 chromosomes \nin a sperm or egg aren’t identical to the chromosomes \nof every other cell in the body. As they go from a cell with 46 \nchromosomes to a sex cell with only 23, the chromosomes within each pair \nswap some sections. This process is called recombination, \nand it means that every sperm or egg contains single chromosomes \nthat are a unique mash up of each pair. Recombination occurs uniquely \nin each sex cell— making two sisters’ chromosomes different\nnot only from their parents’, but from each other’s. Recombination happens before conception, so you get exactly half of your DNA \nfrom each parent, but going further back \nthings get more complicated. Without recombination, you would get \n1/4 from each grandparent, 1/8 from each great-grandparent, \nand so on, but because recombination happens \nevery generation, those numbers vary. The more generations removed \nan ancestor is, the more likely they won’t be represented\nin your DNA at all. For example, without recombination, just 1/64 of your DNA would come \nfrom each ancestor six generations back. Because of recombination, \nthat number can be higher, though we don’t know for sure how high—\nor it can as low as 0. So one sister isn’t more French in the sense of having more \nancestors from France. Instead, the French ancestors are simply\nmore represented in her DNA. But the story doesn’t end there. Tests don’t trace the DNA \nof the sisters' actual French ancestors— we don’t have access to the genomes \nof deceased individuals from previous generations. Instead, these results \nare based on a comparison to the DNA of people \nliving in France today. The tests look for genetic markers, \nor combinations of genetic markers. These markers are short sequences \nthat appear in specific places. The sister deemed \"more French\" \nshares genetic markers with people currently living in France. The assumption is that these \nshared markers indicate ancestors from the same place: France. It’s important to note that results \nare based on people who’ve had their genomes sequenced— 80-90% of which are of European descent. Many indigenous peoples \nare barely represented, if at all. The test won’t reveal heritage from people\nnot represented in the database, and shouldn’t be used to prove \nrace or ethnicity. And as more people get sequenced, \nyour results might change. Looking further back, you may get a result\nlike 2% Neanderthal. Though Neanderthals were a separate \nspecies from humans, that 2% doesn’t come out of the 99% \nof our genome shared among all humans, but the 1% that varies. That’s because about 40,000 years ago, certain human populations \ninterbred with Neanderthals, meaning some people alive today \nhave Neanderthal ancestors. Many Neanderthal ancestors, in fact: there are so many generations \nin 40,000 years that a single Neanderthal’s genetic \ncontribution would be untraceable. You can be both 100% French \nand 2% Neanderthal— though both come from the 1% \nof DNA that makes us different, they’re accounting for different things. Looking for traces of our ancestry \nin our DNA gets complicated very quickly. Both the way we inherit DNA \nand the information available for testing makes it difficult to say certain things\nwith 100% certainty. "

        "text": "The evolutionary tango \nof animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered \"duck vagina,\"\nyou'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance\nmay not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption \nto reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia\nin insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve\nfaster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense\nbecause evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,\nits genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools\nfor reproduction, any improvement there \nwill have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having\nsuch decorative nether regions? After all, the function \nof genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it \nand delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female\nshould do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,\nlooks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find\nin a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems\nnecessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just\ndeposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis\nas courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper\non their penis, which produces a song that reverberates\nthroughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies\nenjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male \nto father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most\nmusical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution\nof insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little\ndrumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap\nthe female with these. And some hoofed mammals,\nlike rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension \non the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose\nbetween males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power\nof female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different\nto conception, and the female genitalia exploit\nthis distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets\nfor separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling \ntheir own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve\ninto such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where\na sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if\nshe fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst\nher offspring. For a male, on the other hand,\nthis is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female\nused his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation\nin an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders \nhave a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina\nblocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's\ngenitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject\nsperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved \ntheir own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely\nnew set of genitalia on their right hand flanks\nwhere the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain\nthe power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped\nlike a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,\ncounterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do \nis flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,\nnot just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of \na furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on\nfor millions of years and will continue for millions \nof years to come.

        "text": "At this very moment, almost everything \naround you is being eaten. Invisible to the naked eye, organisms \ncalled microbes swarm every surface. Hordes of bacteria, archaea, and fungi \nhave evolved to produce powerful enzymes that break down tough organic material \ninto digestible nutrients. But there’s one particularly widespread \ntype of material that almost no microbes can biodegrade: plastics. To make most plastics, molecules \nfrom oil, gas and coal are refined and turned into long, repeating chains \ncalled polymers. This process often requires temperatures \nabove 100˚C, incredibly high pressure, and various chemical modifications. The resulting man-made polymers \nare quite different from the polymers found in nature. And since they’ve only been \naround since the 1950s, most microbes haven’t had time to evolve \nenzymes to digest them. Making matters even more difficult, breaking most plastics’ chemical bonds \nrequires high temperatures comparable to those used to create them— and such heat is deadly to most microbes. This means that most plastics \nnever biologically degrade— they just turn into countless, tiny, \nindigestible pieces. And pieces from the most common plastics \nlike Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and Polyester-terephthalate\nhave been piling up for decades. Each year humanity produces roughly \n400 million more tons of plastic, 80% of which is discarded as trash. Of that plastic waste, \nonly 10% is recycled. 60% gets incinerated \nor goes into the landfills, and 30% leaks out into the environment where it will pollute natural ecosystems \nfor centuries. An estimated 10 million tons of plastic \nwaste end up in the ocean each year, mostly in the form of microplastic \nfragments that pollute the food chain. Fortunately, there are microbes \nthat may be able to take a bite out of this \ngrowing problem. In 2016, a team of Japanese researchers \nsampling sludge at a plastic-bottle recycling plant \ndiscovered Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This never-before-identified bacterium \ncontained two enzymes capable of slowly breaking \ndown PET polymers at relatively low temperatures. Researchers isolated the genes coding \nfor these plastic-digesting enzymes, allowing other bioengineers to combine \nand improve the pair— creating super-enzymes that could break \ndown PET up to 6 times faster. Even with this boost, these lab-grown enzymes still took weeks \nto degrade a thin film of PET, and they operated best at temperatures \nbelow 40˚C. However, another group of scientists \nin Japan had been researching bacterial enzymes adapted \nto high temperature environments like compost piles. And within one particularly warm pile \nof rotting leaves and branches, they found gene sequences \nfor powerful degrading enzymes known as Leaf Branch Compost Cutinases. Using fast-growing microorganisms, other researchers were able \nto genetically engineer high quantities of these enzymes. They then enhanced and selected \nspecial variants of the Cutinases that could degrade PET plastic \nin environments reaching 70˚C— a high temperature that can weaken \nPET polymers and make them digestible. With the help of these \nand other tiny diehards, the future of PET recycling \nlooks promising. But PET is just one type of plastic. We still need ways to biologically degrade\nall the other types, including abundant PEs and PPs which only begin breaking down \nat temperatures well above 130˚C. Researchers don’t currently know \nof any microbes or enzymes tough enough to tolerate \nsuch temperatures. So for now, the main way we deal \nwith these plastics is through energy-intensive physical \nand chemical processes. Today only a small fraction \nof plasticwaste can be biologically degraded by microbes. Researchers are looking for more \nheat-tolerant plastivores in the planet’s most hostile environments and engineering better \nplastivorous enzymes in the lab. But we can’t rely solely on these tiny \nhelpers to clean up our enormous mess. We need to completely rethink \nour relationship with plastics, make better use of existing plastics, and stopproducing more of the same. And we urgently need to design more \nenvironmentally friendly types of polymers that our growing entourage of plastivores \ncan easily break down. "

        "text": "Every year, the world uses \n35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel \ndependence pollutes the Earth and it won't last forever. Scientists estimate that we've consumed\nabout 40% of the world's oil. According to present estimates, at this rate, we'll run out of oil\nand gas in 50 years or so, and in about a century for coal. On the flip side, we have abundant\nsun, water, and wind. These are renewable energy sources, meaning that we won't use them up\nover time. What if we could exchange \nour fossil fuel dependence for an existence based \nsolely on renewables? We've pondered that question for decades, and yet, renewable energy still\nonly provides about 13% of our needs. That's because reaching 100% requires\nrenewable energy that's inexpensive and accessible. This represents a huge challenge, even if we ignore the politics involved\nand focus on the science and engineering. We can better understand the problem\nby understanding how we use energy. Global energy use is a diverse \nand complex system, and the different elements \nrequire their own solutions. But for now, we'll focus on two\nof the most familiar in everyday life: electricity and liquid fuels. Electricity powers blast furnaces, \nelevators, computers, and all manner of things in homes,\nbusinesses, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, liquid fuels \nplay a crucial role in almost all forms of transportation. Let's consider the electrical \nportion first. The great news is that our technology\nis already advanced enough to capture all that energy \nfrom renewables, and there's an ample supply. The sun continuously radiates about 173 quadrillion watts \nof solar energy at the Earth, which is almost 10,000 times\nour present needs. It's been estimated that a surface that\nspans several hundred thousand kilometers would be needed to power humanity\nat our present usage levels. So why don't we build that? Because there are other \nhurdles in the way, like efficiency and energy transportation. To maximize efficiency, solar plants must be located in areas \nwith lots of sunshine year round, like deserts. But those are far away \nfrom densely populated regions where energy demand is high. There are other forms of renewable energy\nwe could draw from, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomasses, but they also have limits based on\navailability and location. In principle, a connected electrical\nenergy network with power lines crisscrossing the globe would enable us to transport power\nfrom where it's generated to where it's needed. But building a system on this scale\nfaces an astronomical price tag. We could lower the cost by developing\nadvanced technologies to capture energy more efficiently. The infrastructure for transporting energy\nwould also have to change drastically. Present-day power lines lose about 6-8%\nof the energy they carry because wire material dissipates energy\nthrough resistance. Longer power lines would mean\nmore energy loss. Superconductors could be one solution. Such materials can transport electricity\nwithout dissipation. Unfortunately, they only work\nif cooled to low temperatures, which requires energy \nand defeats the purpose. To benefit from that technology, we'd need to discover \nnew superconducting materials that operate at room temperature. And what about the all-important,\noil-derived liquid fuels? The scientific challenge there is to store\nrenewable energy in an easily transportable form. Recently, we've gotten better\nat producing lithium ion batteries, which are lightweight \nand have high-energy density. But even the best of these\nstore about 2.5 megajoules per kilogram. That's about 20 times less than the energy\nin one kilogram of gasoline. To be truly competitive, car batteries\nwould have to store much more energy without adding cost. The challenges only increase \nfor bigger vessels, like ships and planes. To power a cross-Atlantic \nflight for a jet, we'd need a battery weighing\nabout 1,000 tons. This, too, demands a technological leap\ntowards new materials, higher energy density, and better storage. One promising solution would be\nto find efficient ways to convert solar into chemical energy. This is already happening in labs, but the efficiency is still too low\nto allow it to reach the market. To find novel solutions, we'll need\nlots of creativity, innovation, and powerful incentives. The transition towards all-renewable \nenergies is a complex problem involving technology, \neconomics, and politics. Priorities on how to tackle this challenge\ndepend on the specific assumptions we have to make when trying to solve\nsuch a multifaceted problem. But there's ample reason to be optimistic\nthat we'll get there. Top scientific minds around the world\nare working on these problems and making breakthroughs all the time. And many governments and businesses\nare investing in technologies that harness the energy all around us. "

        "text": "Each time you take a step, 200 muscles work in unison\nto lift your foot, propel it forward, and set it down. It's just one of the many thousands\nof tasks performed by the muscular system. This network of over 650 muscles\ncovers the body and is the reason we can blink, smile, run, jump, and stand upright. It's even responsible for \nthe heart's dependable thump. First, what exactly \nis the muscular system? It's made up of three main muscle types: skeletal muscle, which attaches\nvia tendons to our bones, cardiac muscle, which is only\nfound in the heart, and smooth muscle, which lines\nthe blood vessels and certain organs, like the intestine and uterus. All three types are \nmade up of muscle cells, also known as fibers,\nbundled tightly together. These bundles receive signals from\nthe nervous system that contract the fibers, which in turn\ngenerates force and motion. This produces almost all\nthe movements we make. Some of the only parts of the body whose motions aren't governed \nby the muscular system are sperm cells, the hair-like cilia in our airways, and certain white blood cells. Muscle contraction can be split\ninto three main types. The first two, shortening muscle fibers\nand lengthening them, generate opposing forces. So the biceps will shorten\nwhile the triceps will lengthen or relax, pulling up the arm and making it \nbend at the elbow. This allows us to, say, pick up a book, or if the muscle relationship \nis reversed, put it down. This complementary partnership\nexists throughout the muscular system. The third type of contraction\ncreates a stabilizing force. In these cases, the muscle fibers\ndon't change in length, but instead keep the muscles rigid. This allows us to grip a mug of coffee\nor lean against a wall. It also maintains our posture\nby holding us upright. Skeletal muscles form the bulk\nof the muscular system, make up about 30-40% of the body's weight, and generate most of its motion. Some muscles are familiar to us,\nlike the pectorals and the biceps. Others may be less so,\nlike the buccinator, a muscle that attaches your cheek\nto your teeth, or the body's tiniest skeletal muscle, a one-millimeter-long tissue fragment\ncalled the stapedius that's nestled deep inside the ear. Wherever they occur, skeletal muscles are\nconnected to the somatic nervous system, which gives us almost complete control\nover their movements. This muscle group also contains\ntwo types of muscle fibers to refine our motions even further,\nslow-twitch and fast-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers react instantly\nwhen triggered but quickly use up their energy\nand tire out. Slow-twitch fibers, on the other hand,\nare endurance cells. They react and use energy slowly\nso they can work for longer periods. A sprinter will accumulate more\nfast-twitch muscles in her legs through continuous practice, enabling her to quickly, if briefly,\npick up the pace, whereas back muscles contain \nmore slow-twitch muscles to maintain your posture all day. Unlike the skeletal muscles, the body's\ncardiac and smooth muscles are managed by \nthe autonomic nervous system beyond our direct control. That makes your heart thump\nroughly 3 billion times over the course of your life, which supplies the body \nwith blood and oxygen. Autonomic control also contracts\nand relaxes smooth muscle in a rhythmic cycle. That pumps blood through the smooth\ninternal walls of blood vessels, enables the intestine to constrict and\npush food through the digestive system, and allows the uterus to contract\nwhen a person is giving birth. As muscles work, they also use energy\nand produce an important byproduct, heat. In fact, muscle provides \nabout 85% of your warmth, which the heart and blood vessels\nthen spread evenly across the body via the blood. Without that, we couldn't maintain\nthe temperature necessary for our survival. The muscular system \nmay be largely invisible to us, but it leaves its mark on almost\neverything we do, whether it's the blink of an eye\nor a race to the finish line. "

        "text": "Beginning in the 3rd century,\nbefore the coming era, the Romans conquered\nthe Iberian Peninsula. This period gave rise to several regional\nlanguages in the area that's now Spain, including Castilian, Catalan and Galician. One of these would become Spanish—\nbut not for another 1,500 years. Those years tell the origin story \nof what’s become a global modern language. During the Roman occupation, colloquial spoken Latin, \noften called “Vulgar Latin,” mixed with Indigenous languages. Approximately 75% of modern Spanish comes\nfrom Latin, including syntactic rules. For instance, verbs are conjugated\nin a similar way as in Latin. And like other Roman languages, \nnouns have gender: el sol, the sun, is masculine, \nwhereas la luna, the moon, is feminine. After the Roman Empire collapsed, a series of other powers conquered \nthe region. First came the Visigoths starting \nin the 5th century of the common era. They spoke an eastern Germanic language that would eventually become \npart of German and lent a few words to the language\nthat would become Spanish. Then the Umayyad Caliphate\nousted the Visigoths. They spoke Arabic, which left \na strong mark on modern Spanish: over a thousand words come from Arabic. These often have a starting \n“a” or “z” sound, and sometimes include an “h.” In 1492, the Catholic Church consolidated\nits power through two monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, expelling Muslims and Jews, combining the distinct regional kingdoms\ninto one nation, and adopting one of the local languages \nas the official state language. That language was Castellano,\nor Castilian, from the Kingdom of Castile, which was centrally located in Spain\nand home to Madrid. Thereafter Castellano became Español,\nor Spanish. But the Spanish of 1492 was Old Spanish,\nvery different from Spanish today. That same year, Christopher Columbus\nsailed across the Atlantic Ocean, marking the start of the Spanish conquest\nof the Americas. The Indigenous population of the Americas spoke an estimated \n2,000 different languages. Over the next few decades, most of them were forced to adopt Spanish\nat the expense of their own languages. Still, words from Indigenous languages\nbecame part of Spanish. From Nahuatl, \nthe language of the Aztec Empire, came words with “ch” and “y”\nlike “chapulin” and “coyote.” From Quechua, \na language spoken in the Peruvian Andes, came words with “ch”\nlike “cancha,” “chullo,” and “poncho.” Some of these words describe things that hadn’t existed in the Spanish lexicon\nbefore, while others replaced existing\nSpanish words even in Spain. By the time Miguel de Cervantes published\nthe first part of “Don Quixote” in 1605, the language was arguably more similar \nto modern Spanish than plays of one of his contemporaries, \nWilliam Shakespeare, were to modern English. Starting in the 18th century, French language and culture were\nextremely fashionable in Spain, and later Hispanic America. While the two languages already had\ncommonalities from their shared roots in Latin, Spanish gained new words from French\nduring this period. In the 19th century, \nall over Central and South America, people revolted to gain independence \nfrom Spain. In the newly sovereign nations, people continued to speak the language\nof their former oppressors. Today, there are approximately 415 million\ninhabitants of Hispanic America. Spanish is the official language \nof 21 countries and Puerto Rico. As of 2021, only English, Mandarin,\nand Hindi have more speakers. How does a language with so many\nspeakers around the world not break apart into new languages\nthe way Vulgar Latin did? There's no easy answer to this question. Other languages that spread \nthrough colonialism, like French, have mixed with Indigenous languages \nto form entirely new ones. Some would argue that Spanglish,\na mixture of Spanish and English, is a distinct language \nor on its way to becoming one. But although a person in Buenos Aires\noccasionally might use words that aren’t fully intelligible to someone\nin Bogotá or Mexico City, Spanish retains enough unity \nof syntax, grammar, and vocabulary to remain one language.

        "text": "No matter how we make electricity,\nit takes up space. Electricity from coal requires mines,\nand plants to burn it and convert the heat into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines,\nfacilities to refine the uranium, a reactor, and a place to store \nthe spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines \nor solar panels. How much space depends\non the power source. Say you wanted to power a 10-watt \nlight bulb with fossil fuels like coal. Fossil fuels can produce \nup to 2,000 watts per square meter, so it would only take a credit card-sized\nchunk of land to power the light bulb. With nuclear power, you might only\nneed an area about the size of the palms of your hands. With solar power, you’d need at least\n0.3 square meters of land— twice the size of a cafeteria tray. Wind power would take roughly\n7 square meters— about half the size of a parking space— \nto power the bulb. When you consider the space needed \nto power cities, countries, and the whole world,\nit adds up fast. Today, the world uses 3 trillion watts \nof electricity. To power the entire world \nwith only fossil fuels, you’d need at least about 1,200\nsquare kilometers of space— roughly the area of Grand Bahama island. With nuclear energy, you’d need almost\nfour times as much space at a minimum— roughly 4,000 square kilometers, \na little less than the area of Delaware. With solar, you’d need at least\n95,000 square kilometers, approximately the area of South Korea. With wind power, you’d need two million—\nabout the area of Mexico. For each power source, there’s variability\nin how much power it can generate per square meter, but these numbers give us a general\nsense of the space needed. Of course, building energy infrastructure\nin a desert, a rainforest, a town, or even in the ocean \nare completely different prospects. And energy sources monopolize the space \nthey occupy to very different extents. Take wind power. Wind turbines need to be spread out—\nsometimes half a kilometer apart— so that the turbulence from one turbine doesn’t reduce the efficiency \nof the others. So, much of the land needed \nto generate wind power is still available for other uses. But the baseline amount of space\nstill matters, because cities and other densely populated\nareas have high electricity demands, and space near them is often limited. Our current power infrastructure \nworks best when electricity is generated\nwhere and when it’s needed, rather than being stored or sent\nacross long distances. Still, space demands are only\npart of the equation. As of 2020, 2/3 of our electricity\ncomes from fossil fuels. Every year, electricity generation \nis responsible for about 27% of the more than 50 billion tons \nof greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, accelerating climate change \nand all its harms. So although fossil fuels require the least\nspace of our existing technologies, we can’t continue to rely on them. Cost is another consideration. Nuclear plants don’t emit greenhouse gases\nand don’t require much space, but they’re way more expensive to build\nthan solar panels or wind turbines, and have waste to deal with. Renewables have almost no marginal costs— unlike with plants powered \nby fossil fuels, you don’t need to keep purchasing fuel \nto generate electricity. But you do need lots of wind and sunlight, which are more available in some places \nthan others. No single approach will be\nthe best option to power the entire world while eliminating\nharmful greenhouse gas emissions. For some places, nuclear power\nmight be the best option for replacing fossil fuels. Others, like the U.S., \nhave the natural resources to get most or all of their electricity \nfrom renewables. And across the board, we should be working\nto make our power sources better: safer in the case of nuclear, and easier to store and transport \nin the case of renewables. "

By saying that half of the new territories\nshould allow slavery while half prohibit it, you position the two viewpoints,\npro-slavery and anti-slavery, as equally valid. But if one view is wrong,\nwhile the other is right, a compromise between them is still wrong. And one side is definitely wrong here:\nthe pro-slavery side. The whole reason this government exists, the whole reason states exist at all, \nis to serve the people. That should include all people. Now, I know there are those \namong you who would argue otherwise, even among those in favor\nof ending slavery. In response to your many contorted\narguments, all of them wrong, I offer this reminder: the idea that slavery \nis morally indefensible is not new to you. The founders of your country knew it\nand many even acknowledged it publicly, even those of them who enslaved\nother people themselves. It’s clear that the errors and delusions\non this subject go far beyond the middle ground fallacy, but I call your attention \nto this particular fallacy because it can have dire consequences\nin many situations. Failure to recognize the fact \nthat a compromise between two positions, one of which is morally indefensible,\nis also morally indefensible, has helped to perpetuate countless\ninjustices large and small. Even well-intentioned people—\nwhich rest assured, I don’t mistake you for—\nfall prey to this fallacy, because you humans tend to view compromise\nas a virtue unto itself. “It’s March 1861. Seven states have seceded from the Union since Abraham Lincoln \nwas elected president. As Lincoln takes office with four more\nstates threatening to leave, he promises not to interfere with slavery\nin states where it exists, but to prohibit its expansion \ninto new territories and states.” “It’s April 1861, and a Civil War\nhas broken out over slavery.” Some things can't be resolved\nwith a compromise.

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do horror movies and comedies have in common? The two genres might seem totally different, but the reason they're both so popular is perhaps because what they have in common: their use of dramatic irony. First, let's clarify. There are three types of irony out there. Situational irony is when you expect one thing, but get the opposite. Verbal irony is when someone says something, but truly means the opposite. Dramatic irony, though, is what we will be looking at right now. Dramatic irony is when the audience seems to know more about an event, a situation, or a conversation than the characters in the movie, on the show, or in the book do. The audience is in on a secret that the characters have missed. This is a great story-telling device that creates tremendous emotion within that text. Think about it for a moment. How does it feel when, in a horror film, you know that the scary villain is hiding behind that door in the darkened room. The music becomes eerie, the lighting creates complete shadows, this has to be bad for the hero! Of course, though, that hero must enter the room to find the villain. You feel tremendous tension and the suspense of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary, but you just don't know when. That tension is dramatic irony: you know something more than the characters in the film. Now, take the typical comedy. There will probably be some type of \"misunderstanding\". Again, we know more of what is going on than the characters do. Picture two characters making a plan for a birthday surprise for their roommate while that roommate overhears the entire conversation from the hallway. From there, confusion and misunderstanding occur, and the tension builds. This isn't the same tension as the horror film since it is probably pretty funny as the character tries to figure out the whos and the whats, but it serves as a great example of the tension and suspense of dramatic irony. This tension or suspense in both genres drives the story and keeps the plot progressing. The audience wants, no, needs, to see the tension of the dramatic irony broken either by the scary person jumping out of the shadows or by someone finally revealing someone's true identity and clearing up the confusion. So, when you feel like you are in on a secret, that is dramatic irony, a hallmark of all the great writers, from Shakespeare to Hitchcock. "

So if you'd like to add a little humor to that story, or speech, \nor screenplay you're writing, here are a few tips and tricks\nfor finding the funny. All great storytelling, \nincluding comedy writing, consists of a handful \nof basic ingredients: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Writers have been asking these questions\nsince at least the 1st century BC, yet none can be answered \nwith a simple yes or no. They demand details, and the more specific the details,\nthe funnier the story. Let's start with the who,\nthe comedic character. Think about the books, TV shows,\nand movies that make you laugh. They're usually filled with funny types,\nor archetypes. The know-it-all, the loveable loser, the bad boss, the neurotic, the airhead. Incidentally, these are all stock \ncharacters found in Commedia Dell'Arte, or the artists comedy \nof late Renaissance Italy, and they have yet to get old. The Commedia rule for creating comic \ncharacters is find the flaw, then play it up. Or you can try playing with opposites. When the smartest guy in the room\ndoes the stupidest thing, or the doofus outwits the brainiac, we tend to laugh because\nwe didn't see that coming. Ancient Greek funnyman Aristotle\nis said to have said, \"The secret to humor is surprise.\" This surprise, \nor incongruity theory of humor, says we laugh at things \nthat seem out of place or run up against our expectations, like a frog dating a pig, or a lizard selling insurance, a baby disco dancing, a nun disco dancing, a cat disco dancing. Actually, a baby, a nun, or a cat\ndoing pretty much anything, especially involving disco. One fun way to find incongruities\nis by drawing connections. Actually drawing them with a mind map. Start small. Pick a word, I choose pickle. Jot it down, then quick as you can,\ntry making connections. What do pickles make me think of? Who eats pickles? What treasured pickle memories\ndo I have from childhood? Another great way to generate\ncomedic material is to shift from observation\nto imagination. Try going from \"what is\"\nto \"what if?\" Like, what if instead of a horse,\nfor example, you just had a pair of coconuts? Okay, let's think of some other\nmemorable moments in history, literature, or film. Now, what if they featured coconuts? Get wild, let it go. Even if an idea seems overdone, or too obvious, or just plain dumb, try jotting it down, anyway. What's obvious to you\nmay not be to the next person. And the opposite of the dumbest idea\nmight just turn out to be the smartest. What about all that dumb stuff\nthat happens in real life? Have you ever noticed how much comedy\nrevolves around things that irritate, frustrate, \nand humiliate us? Will Rodgers said, \"Everything's funny\nas long as it happens to somebody else.\" So if you're having a crummy morning, imagine it happening to a character\nyou're writing about, and by afternoon, you may at least\nget a funny story out of it. Once you've got your characters\nand story, here are a few quick and easy comedy\nwriting tricks to make them zing. The rule of three, or zig zig zag. Try setting up an expected pattern,\nzig zig, then flip it, zag. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut\nwalk into a bar. The punchline rule says put your punch\nat the end of the line. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut\nwalk into a disco. That brings up the rule of K. For some reason, words with a k-sound\ncatch our ears and are considered comical. Coconut, disco, pickles, crickets? Okay, so we don't always get the laugh. Humor is subjective. Comedy is trial and error. Writing is rewriting. Just keep trying. Find the flaws, discover the details, insert incongruities, incorporate k-words, and remember the most important rule\nof writing funny: have fun. As Charles Dickins said, \"There is nothing in the world so\nirresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor.\" And disco. "

        "text": "This syringe contains a radioactive form \nof glucose known as FDG. The doctor will soon inject its contents \ninto her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer \nusing a PET scanner. The FDG will quickly circulate \nthrough his body. If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a \nsignificant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon \nfor the scanner. PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools \nin medical diagnostics, and their life begins in \na particle accelerator, just hours earlier. The particle accelerator in question \nis called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker \nwithin hospitals. It uses electromagnetic fields to propel \ncharged particles like protons faster and faster \nalong a spiraling path. When the protons reach \ntheir maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains\na few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen \ncalled oxygen-18. When a proton slams into one of these \nheavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle \ncalled a neutron. This impact turns oxygen-18 \ninto fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be \ndetected on a PET scan. In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone \ndue to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking \nto get the scan done. So how can fluorine-18 be \nused to detect diseases? Radiochemists at the hospital can use \na series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine \nto different molecules, creating radiotracers. The identity of the tracer depends on what\ndoctors want to observe. FDG is a common one because the rate at \nwhich cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia. The FDG is now ready for \nthe patient’s scan. When a radiolabeled tracer \nenters the body, it travels through the circulatory system \nand gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain,\ncancer cells, or otherwise. Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has \nfound its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation. Now the doctors can see \ntheir target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner. The radiation that the tracer emits \nis what makes this possible. The isotopes used in PET decay \nby positron emission. Positrons are essentially electrons \nwith positive charge. When emitted, a positron collides \nwith an electron from another molecule in its surroundings. This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is \nconverted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors \nin the scanner walls. The software in the scanner \nuses those detectors to estimate where inside the body \nthe collision occurred and create a 3D map of the \ntracer’s distribution. PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with \nother types of imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis\nof Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that \notherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy. Meanwhile, researchers are actively \nworking to develop new tracers and expand the possibilities of what \nPET scans can be used for. But with all this talk of radiation and\nnuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe? Even though no amount of ionizing \nradiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives\nduring a PET scan is actually quite low. One scan is comparable to what you’re \nexposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, \nlike radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after \n20 to 30 transatlantic flights. Most patients feel that those risks \nare acceptable for the chance to diagnose \nand treat their illnesses. "

        "text": "Hello, everyone. \nLet's begin our guided tour. Welcome to the Museum of Museums. Museums have been a part of human history\nfor over 2000 years. But they weren't always \nlike the ones we visit today. The history of museums is far older\nand much stranger than you might imagine. We'll start over here in the Greek wing. Our word museum\ncomes from the Greek mouseion, temples built for the Muses,\nthe goddesses of the arts and the sciences. Supplicants asked the Muses \nto keep watch over academics and grant ingenuity \nto those they deemed worthy. The temples were filled \nwith offerings of sculptures, mosaics, complex scientific apparatuses, poetic and literary inscriptions, and any other tribute that would \ndemonstrate a mortal's worthiness for divine inspiration. We have arrived at the Mesopotamian wing. The first museum was created in 530 B.C.\nin what is now Iraq. And the first curator \nwas actually a princess. Ennigaldi-Nanna started to collect\nand house Mesopotamian antiquities in E-Gig-Par, her house. When archeologists excavated the area, they discovered dozens of artifacts\nneatly arranged in rows, with clay labels \nwritten in three languages. She must have had interesting parties. The tradition of collecting and displaying\nintriguing items began to be mimicked, as you can see here \nin the Roman Empire wing. Treasure houses \nof politicians and generals were filled with the spoils of war, and royal menageries \ndisplayed exotic animals to the public on special occasions,\nlike gladiator tournaments. As you can see, we have a lion here\nand a gladiator, and, well, the janitor ought \nto be in this wing clearly. Moving on, hurry along. The next step in the evolution of museums\noccurred in the Renaissance, when the study of the natural world\nwas once again encouraged after almost a millennium \nof Western ignorance. Curiosity cabinets,\nalso referred to as Wunderkammers, were collections of objects that acted\nas a kind of physical encyclopedia, showcasing artifacts. Just step into the wardrobe here.\nThere you go. Mind the coats. And we'll tour Ole Worm's cabinet, One of the most notable Wunderkammers belonged to a wealthy \n17th-century naturalist, antiquarian, and physician Ole Worm. Ole Worm collected natural specimens, human skeletons, ancient runic texts, and artifacts from the New World. In other curiosity cabinets, you could find genetic anomalies, precious stones, works of art, and religious and historic relics. Oh my. You might not want to touch that. These cabinets were private, again,\noften in residencies, curated by their owners, \nrulers and aristocrats, as well as merchants and early scientists. Now, who hears a circus organ? In the 1840s, an enterprising young showman\nnamed Phineas T. Barnum purchased some of the more famous\ncabinets of curiosity from Europe and started Barnum's American Museum\nin New York City. A spectacular hodgepodge of zoo, lecture hall, wax museum, theater, and freak show that was known\nfor its eclectic residents, such as bears, elephants, acrobats, giants, Siamese twins, a Fiji mermaid, and a bearded lady, along with a host of modern machinery\nand scientific instruments. Museums open to the public\nare a relatively new phenomenon. Before Barnum, the first public museums were only accessible \nby the upper and middle classes, and only on certain days. Visitors would have to apply \nto visit the museum in writing prior to admision, and only small groups could visit\nthe museum each day. The Louvre famously allowed all members\nof the public into the museum but only three days a week. In the 19th century, the museum as we know it\nbegan to take shape. Institutions like the Smithsonian\nwere started so that objects could be seen and studied,\nnot just locked away. American museums, in particular, commissioned experiments and hired explorers to seek out \nand retrieve natural samples. Museums became centers for scholarship\nand artistic and scientific discovery. This is often called the Museum Age. Nowadays, museums are open to everybody, are centers of learning and research, and are turning \ninto more hands-on institutions. But the question of who gets to go\nis still relevant as ticket prices can sometimes \nbar admission to those future scholars, artists\nand targets of divine inspiration who can't afford \nto satisfy their curiosity. Thank you all for coming,\nand please, feel free to stop by the gift shop \nof gift shops on your way out. "

        "text": "If you ever find yourself \ngazing at falling snow, why not catch a few snowflakes \non your glove and examine their shapes? You might notice \nthat they look symmetrical, and if you look closely, you'll see they have six sides. You could say a snowflake \nis simply frozen water, but compare one \nwith an ice cube from the freezer, and you'll realize \nthey're very different things. Unlike ice cubes, formed when liquid\nfreezes into a solid, snowflakes form when water vapor\nturns straight into ice. But that still doesn't explain why\nsnowflakes have six sides. To understand that, we need to delve deeper \ninto the physics of water. Water is made out of two hydrogen atoms\nand one oxygen atom. A single water molecule \nthus has ten protons and ten electrons, eight from oxygen \nand one from each hydrogen atom. The two electrons \nfrom oxygen's outer shell are shared with two electrons\nfrom both hydrogens as they bond together, and the remaining \nfour outer shell electrons from oxygen form two pairs. We call the bonds between these atoms\ncovalent bonds. The pairs of electrons \nare all negatively charged. Similar charges repel, so they tend to stay as far away\nfrom each other as possible. The pairs form four electron clouds, two of which are where the hydrogen\nand oxygen share electrons. The repulsion between the unbonded pairs is even stronger than repulsion\nbetween the shared pairs, so the two hydrogens \nget pushed a little further to an angle of 104.5 degrees. The water molecule as a whole\nis electrically neutral, but oxygen gets \na larger share of electrons, making it slightly negative\nand the hydrogens slightly positive. Due to its negative charge, the oxygen in one molecule is attracted to the positive charge\nof the hydrogen in another molecule. And so a weak bond \nbetween the two molecules, called a hydrogen bond,\nis formed. When water freezes, this bonding\noccurs on repeat, ultimately forming a hexagonal structure due to the angle between hydrogens\nand oxygen within each molecule. This is the seed of a snowflake, and it retains a hexagonal shape\nas it grows. As the snowflake moves through the air, water vapor molecules \nstick to the six sharp edges and expand the snowflake outwards,\nbit by bit. A snowflake's developing shape depends\non atmospheric conditions, like humidity and temperature. As a snowflake falls, changes in weather conditions\ncan affect how it grows, and even small differences in the paths\ntwo snowflakes take will differentiate their shapes. However, since conditions at the six \nsharp edges of one snowflake are similar, a symmetric snowflake can grow. Weather conditions \naffect snow on the ground, as well. Warmer ground temperatures produce\na wetter snow that is easier to pack because liquid water molecules\nhelp snowflakes stick to each other. Melted snow also plays a critical role\nin another wintry activity, skiing. Completely dry snow \nis very difficult to ski on because there's too much friction between\nthe jagged snowflakes and the ski surface. So what's happening is that as skis move, they rub the surface of the snow\nand warm it up, creating a thin layer of water,\nwhich helps them slide along. So technically, \nit's not really snow skiing, but water skiing. But it is true that \nno matter how hard you look, you're almost definitely not going to find\ntwo identical snowflakes, and that's a mystery that scientists\nare still trying to solve, though we know that it has to do with the many possible \nbranching points in snowflake formation, and the differences \nin temperature and humidity, and while we wait for the answer, we can enjoy watching these tiny fractals\nfalling from the sky.

        "text": "In 1980, two American professors\nbet $1,000 on a question with stakes \nthat couldn’t be higher: would the earth run out of resources \nto sustain a growing human population? One of them was Stanford biologist \nPaul Ehrlich, who wrote the bestselling 1968 book,\n“The Population Bomb.” The global population had grown\nrapidly since World War II, and Ehrlich predicted that millions\nwould starve to death as the population increased faster\nthan the food supply. He drew from the ideas of 18th century\neconomist Thomas Malthus and related work from the 20th century. Malthus had posited \nthat population growth, if unchecked over time, \nwould always outpace food supply. Through the 1970s, \nit seemed like Ehrlich was right: famines, pollution, and political unrest had many concerned that humanity \nwas on the brink of such a crisis, and some governments considered \nand even implemented policies to limit population growth. Betting against Ehrlich was Julian Simon,\na professor of business and economics. He analyzed historic data\nfrom around the world, and found no correlation \nbetween a growing population and a decrease in standards of living— in fact, he found the opposite. He argued that Ehrlich’s work,\nand that of Malthus before him, was based on theoretical calculations, while the real-world data\ntold a different story. But then, he departed \nfrom the data himself, claiming human ingenuity would always\nfind alternatives to compensate for diminishing resources. If that seems overly optimistic to you,\nwell, you're not alone. Ehrlich and other experts found \nSimon’s claims preposterous. In June 1980, Simon wrote a scathing \narticle for Science Magazine that incited a heated debate of published \narticles between the two men. Simon said he should have placed a wager\nagainst Ehrlich years before, when Ehrlich ventured that, “England would not exist \nin the year 2000.” Later that year, \nSimon called Ehrlich a false prophet and challenged him to a bet. Their feud also touched\non the debate about whether to prioritize environmental\nprotections or economic growth, a key issue in the American presidential\nrace between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. After some debate,\nthey set the final terms: $200 on the price\nof each of five metals. If the price of the metal decreased \nor held steady over the next decade, Simon won. If the price increased,\nEhrlich won. Wait, what? Weren’t we talking \nabout overpopulation and famine? What could the price of metals possibly\nhave to do with that? Well, the reality is that the price of\nmetals may not have been the best choice— many factors impact these prices that have\nnothing to do with overpopulation. But their reasoning was as follows: \nmetals are finite natural resources used in all sorts of manufacturing. Ehrlich believed a growing population \nwould consume such finite resources, and scarcity would drive the prices up. Simon thought humanity would find\nsubstitutes for the metals, and the prices would stay stable \nor even decrease. So, what happened? The world population continued \nto increase over the next 10 years, but the price of all five metals \ndecreased, making Simon the clear winner of a bet\nthat may not have been a great proxy for the question they were\ndebating, anyway. As for the question itself, today, their focus on overpopulation represent\na snapshot of history. Our understanding of what causes\nstarvation and famine has progressed: we have the resources to support\na growing human population, but we’re currently failing to distribute\nthose resources equitably, and changing that should be our priority. And we no longer see population size \nas a primary cause of environmental degradation \nand climate change, or limiting population growth \nas a viable solution to these problems. Rather, experts largely agree\nthat our focus should be on replacing unsustainable technologies\nand practices with sustainable ones, and that economic growth \nand environmental protections don’t have to be at odds. In October 1990, Julian Simon \nreceived a check from Paul Ehrlich. There was no note. "

        "text": "The sight of mistletoe may either send\nyou scurrying or if you have your eye on someone, awaiting an opportunity\nbeneath its snow white berries. But how did the festive Christmas \ntradition of kissing under mistletoe come about? The long lived custom intertwines \nthe mythology and biology of this intriguing plant. There are more than 1,000 species of\nmistletoe which grows the world over. In fact, the ancient Europeans\nwere so captivated by the plant’s unusual growth habits \nthat they included it in their legends and myths. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder \ndescribed how the Druid priesthood in ancient England\nbelieved that mistletoe was a plant dropped down from heaven \nby the gods; that explained its unlikely position \namongst the high branches of certain trees. They also believed it had powers \nof healing and bestowing fertility. Meanwhile, Scandinavian legends told \nof the plant’s mystical qualities in the story of the god Baldur\nand his adoring mother, Frigg, goddess of love, marriage and fertility. Frigg loved her son so much \nthat she commanded every plant, animal and inanimate object to vow \nthey’d never harm him. In her fervor, however, \nshe overlooked the mistletoe. The mischievous god Loki realized \nthis oversight, and pierced Baldur’s heart with an arrow \ncarved from a mistletoe branch. Frigg cried tears of such\nsadness that they formed the mistletoe’s pearly berries, making the other gods pity her \nand agree to resurrect Baldur. Hearing the news, Frigg became \nso overjoyed that she transformed the mistletoe from a symbol of death\ninto one of peace and love. She mandated a one day\ntruce for all fights and that everyone embraced beneath \nits branches when they passed to spread more love into the world. In the 17th century, British colonists \narriving in the New World found a different but very similar looking\nspecies of mistletoe. They applied it to these tales\nof magic, fertility and love, spreading the mistletoe hanging tradition\nfrom Europe into America. By the 18th century, people \nin Britain had turned this into a Christmas tradition. But this custom comes down to more \nthan just human imagination. All of it was inspired\nby the plant’s intriguing biology. We see mistletoe as a festive decoration,\nbut draped on tree boughs in the wild, it’s known as a partly parasitic plant. Mistletoe relies on modified roots\ncalled haustoria that penetrate the tree bark \nand siphon off the water and minerals trees carry up their trunks. To colonize nearby trees with its seeds, mistletoe depends on birds \nand other creatures to do the dispersing. Birds that eat the mistletoe’s \nsticky white berries sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds\nby wiping them off onto tree bark, or with a bit of luck, they excrete the indigestible seed\nonto a tree where it germinates and starts to grow. With its resilience and foliage \nthat stays lush even while the surrounding trees \nlose their leaves, you can see why mistletoe captivated\nour superstitious ancestors. They saw these as signs of the plant’s\nmagical qualities and fertility. Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder with the diversity of wildlife\nit supports. More than just a parasite, \nit’s also known as a keystone species. It's eaten by a diversity of animals,\nincluding deer, elk, squirrels, chipmunks, porcupines, robins, bluebirds, \nmourning doves, and the butterfly genus Delius. Some mistletoe species\nproduce dense bushes, which are excellent nesting locations\nfor a variety of birds. And despite their parasitic\nrelationship with trees, mistletoes can also help other plants. For instance, juniper sprouts \nnear mistletoe to benefit from the visiting berry-eating birds. Through the many benefits it provides, mistletoe influences diversity \nand allows ecosystems to flourish. You might even say, \nthat for this iconic plant, life imitates legend. In the wild, mistletoe has the power \nto bring things together. And in our own traditions \nwe see that happening too. "

        "text": "The vagina harbors hundreds of different\nkinds of microorganisms. Some tend to be especially prevalent,\nlike Lactobacilli. These bacteria produce an acid \nthat lowers the vagina’s pH, limiting what can survive there and\npreventing against certain infections. Candida yeasts are also usually present\nin small quantities. Most of the time, \nthese fungi are harmless. The body’s immune system keeps them \nin check while other microorganisms, like Lactobacilli, combat and outcompete\nthem for nutrients and territory. But under certain conditions, \nCandida yeasts can cause infections. One species in particular,\ncalled Candida albicans, is the usual culprit of vaginal thrush\nor yeast infections, which affect 3 out of every 4 people \nwith a vagina. So, how exactly does a yeast\ninfection happen? Candida albicans yeasts are shapeshifters. And when the balance within the vagina\nis disrupted— like the pH increases or there are \nfewer microbes to compete with— Candida albicans may assume \ntheir disease-causing forms. They multiply and metamorphose— substituting their rounded structures for elongated thread-like forms \ncalled hyphae. Then, they secrete enzymes that degrade\nthe epithelial cells lining the vagina and permeate the tissue. Immune cells rush to the site, generating some of the most recognizable\nsymptoms of yeast infections: itching, burning, swelling, and redness. These may also be accompanied\nby a change in vaginal discharge, the fluid that’s frequently flushed from\nthe vagina to keep it healthy and clean. During a yeast infection,\ndischarge may become thicker and whiter because the vagina is shedding \nmore epithelial and Candida cells. A few major factors, like \nantibiotic treatments and lower immunity, can make people more susceptible \nto vaginal yeast infections. When someone’s immune system is\ncompromised, from illness or otherwise, their body may be unable to control\nCandida effectively. And in treating bacterial infections,\nantibiotics kill harmful bacteria, but they can also wipe out beneficial \nones, like Lactobacilli, allowing Candida to multiply more easily. Many other factors also help set\nthe stage for yeast infections. Hormonal changes and diet alter\nthe vaginal microbiome. Semen is relatively basic, \nso it can disrupt the vagina’s pH. Tight, non-breathable, and wet garments\nincubate moisture and are thought to facilitate\na more Candida-friendly environment. Soaps can damage the protective\nmucus that coats the vagina, making it easier for Candida to permeate. That’s why many doctors recommend\njust gently washing the vulva with water. And it’s important to wipe \nfrom front to back to avoid introducing more Candida as well \nas other potentially harmful microbes to the vagina. Most yeast infections are mild \nand clear up within two weeks. Antifungal medications usually offer\ndependable treatments by reducing the number of Candida cells, allowing the immune system and \nother microorganisms to regain control. And interestingly, the solution \nto treating some yeast infections could be more yeasts. Preliminary studies with probiotics \ncontaining the harmless yeasts we use in brewing and baking have shown \npromise in keeping Candida in check while reducing inflammation. But some yeast infections\nrequire more extensive therapies. About 5 to 10% of people with vaginas experience at least 4 yeast infections \na year. For some of those, \nthe cause seems to be genetic. Some people have gene variants that make\nit harder for their immune systems to recognize and regulate Candida cells. But why many others have recurrent\ninfections is currently unclear— and requires a lot more research. In fact, so does basically everything\nwe've just talked about. We don’t know nearly enough \nabout the vaginal microbiome. This is probably because of stigma\nand underfunding when it comes to topics that traditionally\nfall under the umbrella of “women’s health.” For instance, while erectile dysfunction\naffects a much smaller percentage of people than vaginal yeast infections, there’s about 6 times more\nresearch on the subject. Hopefully, we’ll soon have\na better understanding of the many microorganismal multitudes \nwe contain— and how best to keep them in balance. "

        "text": "Every year before the ancient Greeks\nsowed their seeds of grain, they celebrated Demeter, \nthe goddess of agriculture. On Earth, each morsel of food \nwas sweet sustenance, while in the land of the dead,\nit ensured a permanent stay. Demeter tended to Earth’s fields \nwith her beloved daughter, Persephone, who inherited her mother’s passions\nand grew into a bright young woman. But all the while, a shadowy figure\nwatched from below. One day, Persephone was frolicking\nin a meadow with a freshwater nymph, Cyane. As they admired a blooming\nnarcissus flower, they noticed it tremble in the ground. Suddenly, the earth split, \nand a terrifying figure arose. It was Hades, god of the dead\nand the underworld. He wrenched Persephone from Cyane,\ndragged her into his inky chariot, and blasted back through the earth. Cyane wept so hard she dissolved,\nbecoming one with the river. By the time Demeter arrived \nat the scene of the abduction, the crater in the meadow had closed—\nand Cyane and Persephone had vanished. Demeter sped to Mount Olympus for help. Many of the gods had witnessed the scene. And they knew about the deal \nthat paved the way for it: Zeus, Persephone’s father, \nhad granted Hades her hand in marriage without her consent— or Demeter’s. But when faced with Demeter’s pleas, \nthe other gods stayed silent, So, she searched alone. In her grief and desperation, \nshe neglected her usual tasks. Crops withered, and a great famine \nplagued the Earth. As mortals began to perish, \nthe gods grew wary. Who would worship them and \noffer tributes if the humans disappeared? So, Zeus ordered Demeter to stop \nher crusade and returned to her duties. But she refused. Deep below, across the frigid river Styx,\nand through the halls of the underworld, Persephone was waging her own protest. Hades expected her to serve\nas his wife and queen. But Persephone rebuffed the god’s advances\nand refused food. As she longed for her mother’s company, her friends’ laughter,\nand the sun’s warmth, Persephone grew colder and lonelier. And she was starving. She hungered for satisfying grains,\ncrisp vegetables and fresh fruit. Wandering the ghostly gardens, she contemplated the pomegranates \nthat hung heavily on their branches... Meanwhile, Demeter continued her hunt. She appealed to the all-seeing sun god,\nHelios, whose rays had long warmed her crops. Indeed, when Helios drew his golden\nchariot across the sky that fateful day, he saw what happened— \nand he knew of the deal. Out of respect and sympathy for Demeter, Helios told her of Hades’ demands,\nZeus’ betrayal and Persephone’s abduction. Furious and heartbroken, Demeter sped\nto Mount Olympus and confronted Zeus, demanding their daughter’s return. But Zeus declined: in her ravenous hunger, Persephone had eaten a few seeds from the \npomegranate that grew in the underworld. Though a meager amount, it was enough\nto ensnare her in Hades forever. Demeter wouldn't accept this fate. She swore that if she wasn’t\nreunited with Persephone, the fields would never be fertile again, and the distinction between the Earth \nand the underworld would soon dissolve. So, they made a pact. For two thirds of every year, Persephone \nwould return to the land of the living, But for the remainder, she would stay \nin the world of the dead. When Persephone ascended to Earth,\nshe and her mother rejoiced. Together, they showered the fields \nwith rain and nurtured them with sun. For mortals, Persephone’s arrival came\nto herald the start of spring. But her descent always came too soon. Each time she returned to Hades, \nDemeter mourned, and the earth grew cold, \ndark, and unyielding, ushering in the winter months. Knowing Demeter couldn’t be roused \nfrom her grief, the humans stored their crops, \nstoked their fires, and awaited Persephone’s safe return. And so it was that her transit marked\nthe gradual turning of the seasons and the bittersweet compromise\nbetween life and death. "

        "text": "Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy\ntwo billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common\ngarments in the world. But how and where is the average\nt-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life\non a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and\ngrown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest\nthese puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically\nseparates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed \ninto 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity\nof water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce\nthe average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides\nand pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton\ngrown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons \nof cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them\nto a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into\nsnowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets \nof rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals\nuntil they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into\ncommercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring\nin about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain\ncancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals\ncan cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water\nin rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced\nin some countries that the entire process of growing\nand producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth \ntravels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,\nor Turkey, human labor is still required \nto stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that \nmachines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's\nbiggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people\nin the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions\nand low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts\ntravel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton \nan enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce \ntheir own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts\nfor 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's\nwillingness to buy boosted global production \nfrom 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most\nresource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly\n400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers \nboth use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times\nmore than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing \nconsumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations\nand the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable \nhuman labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second\nlargest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from\nrecycled or organic fabrics. Wash clothes less and line dry\nto save resources. Instead of throwing them away\nat the end of their life, donate, recycle, or reuse them\nas cleaning rags. And, finally, you might ask yourself, how many t-shirts and articles of clothing\nwill you consume over your lifetime, and what will be their combined \nimpact on the world? "

But why do these reactions happen in the first place? Kareem Jarrah answers this question by examining the two underlying forces that drive both endothermic and exothermic chemical reactions: enthalpy and entropy.\n\nLesson by Kareem Jarrah, animation by Flaming Medusa Studios Inc.",

        "text": "You know how sometimes\nyou go to bake a cake but your bananas have all gone rotten, your utensils have rusted, you trip and pour all of your baking soda\ninto the vinegar jug, and then your oven explodes? My friend, you and your chemical reactions\nhave fallen victim to enthalpy and entropy and, boy, are they forces \nto be reckoned with. Now, your reactants are all products. So, what are these \"E\" words,\nand what's their big idea? Let's start with enthalpy, an increase or decrease of energy\nduring a chemical reaction. Every molecule has a certain amount\nof chemical potential energy stored within the bonds between its atoms. Chemicals with more energy \nare less stable, and thus, more likely to react. Let's visualize the energy flow \nin a reaction, the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen,\nby playing a round of crazy golf. Our goal is to get a ball, the reactant,\nup a small rise and down the other much steeper slope. Where the hill goes up,\nwe need to add energy to the ball, and where it goes down, the ball releases\nenergy into its surroundings. The hole represents the product,\nor result of the reaction. When the reaction period ends,\nthe ball is inside the hole, and we have our product: water. This, like when our oven exploded,\nis an exothermic reaction, meaning that the chemical's final energy\nis less than its starting energy, and the difference has been added\nto the surrounding environment as light and heat. We can also play out\nthe opposite type of reaction, an endothermic reaction, where the final energy is greater \nthan the starting energy. That's what we were trying \nto achieve by baking our cake. The added heat from the oven would \nchange the chemical structure of the proteins in the eggs\nand various compounds in the butter. So that's enthalpy. As you might suspect, exothermic reactions are more likely \nto happen than endothermic ones because they require less energy to occur. But there's another independent factor\nthat can make reactions happen: entropy. Entropy measures a chemical's randomness. Here's an enormous pyramid of golf balls. Its ordered structure \nmeans it has low entropy. However, when it collapses, \nwe have chaos everywhere, balls bouncing high and wide. So much so that some \neven go over the hill. This shift to instability, \nor higher entropy, can allow reactions to happen. As with the golf balls, \nin actual chemicals this transition from structure to disorder\ngets some reactants past the hump and lets them start a reaction. You can see both enthalpy\nand entropy at play when you go to light \na campfire to cook dinner. Your match adds enough energy to activate the exothermic reaction\nof combustion, converting the high-energy \ncombustible material in the wood to lower energy carbon dioxide and water. Entropy also increases\nand helps the reaction along because the neat, organized log of wood is now converted into randomly moving\nwater vapor and carbon dioxide. The energy shed by this \nexothermic reaction powers the endothermic reaction\nof cooking your dinner. Bon appétit! "

        "text": "What is love? Seriously, though, what is it? What is love? A verb? A noun? A universal truth? An ideal? A common thread of all religions? A cult? A neurological phenomenon? There's no shortage of answers. Some are all-encompassing. It conquers all. It's all you need. It's all there is. These are all comparisons, though, ways of defining it by contrast, by saying it's more important than all other things, but is it? Sure, love matters more than your standard turkey sandwich, but does it matter more than shelter? Or sanity? Or an exceptional turkey sandwich? No matter your answer, you're just ranking it, not defining it. Another challenge to defining love is we often try to do so while falling into it or out of it. Would you trust someone who just won the lottery to accurately define the concept of currency? Or, I don't know, ask a guy to define bears while he's fending them off? Or is romance not like winning the lottery? Are break ups not like bear attacks? Bad comparisons? That's my point. I'm not thinking right because I'm in love, so ha! Taking a step back, or taking a cold shower, whatever, love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing in all of human history. And despite centuries upon centuries of obsession, it still overwhelms us. Some say it's a feeling, a magical emotion, a feeling for someone like you've never felt before. But feelings are fluid, not very concrete foundation for a definition. Sometimes you hate the person you love. Plus, come on, you've felt feelings like it before, sort of in miniature. Your relationships with your family shape your relationships with partners. And your love for your partner may be in its own dynamic relationship, healthy or totally weird, with the love of your parents and siblings. Love is also a set of behaviors we associate with the feeling: Holding hands, kissing, hugging, public displays of affection, dating, marriage, having kids, or just sex. But these loving actions can be subjective or culturally relative. You may love or be someone who can't have kids or doesn't want to, who believes in marriage but also in divorce, who's from a culture where people don't really date the way we think of dating, or who just doesn't want to make out on the bus. But if love is a thing that we can define, then how can it mean opposite things for so many people? So, maybe love's just all in your head, a personal mystery winding through your neural pathways and lighting up pleasing, natural rewards in your nervous system. Perhaps these rewards are addictive. Perhaps love is a temporary or permanent addiction to a person, just like a person can be addicted to a drug. I don't mean to be edgy like some pop song. Evidence shows that chemicals in your brain stimulated by another person can make you develop a habit for that person. The person comes to satisfy a physiological craving, and you want more. But then sometimes, slowly or suddenly, you don't. You've fallen out of love, become unaddicted, for a spell. What happened? Does one develop a tolerance or hit a limit? Why do some lovers stay addicted to each other their entire lives? Perhaps to create new lives, to proliferate their species? Maybe love is just human DNA's optimal method for bringing about its own replication. There are evolutionary arguments regarding every human mating behavior, from how we display ourselves to potential mates, to how we treat each other in relationships, to how we raise kids. Thus, some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul is just biology's way to make you continue our species. Nature has selected you to have crushes on hotties, just like it makes monkeys have crushes on hot monkeys, and biology marches on. But is that all love is? Or, perhaps worse, is it just a construct, some fake concept we all convince each other to try to live up to for a fake sense of purpose? Maybe it is a construct, but let's be more precise about what a construct is because love is constructed from reality: Our experiences, feelings, brain chemistry, cultural expectations, our lives. And this edifice can be viewed through countless dimensions: scientific, emotional, historical, spiritual, legal, or just personal. If no two people are the same, no two people's love is the same either. So, in every loving relationship, there's a lot to talk about and partners should be open to that, or the relationship probably won't last. Love is always up for discussion and, sure, under construction. So, if we can't define it, that's a good sign. It means we're all still making it. Wait, I didn't mean, you know what I meant. "

        "text": "The world is getting closer to achieving one of the most important \npublic health goals of our time: eradicating HIV. And to do this, we won’t even have \nto cure the disease. We simply have to stop HIV from \nbeing transmitted until eventually it fizzles out. Once, this goal would have \nseemed impossible. HIV has caused millions of deaths and is one of the most devastating \ndiseases that humanity has ever known. But we’re now at a point where new \nadvances such as one-pill, once-a-day medications are helping us tackle HIV \nin effective ways. HIV is a retrovirus– meaning it integrates copies of itself \ninto an infected cell’s DNA, allowing it to replicate and \ninfect other cells. HIV has evolved numerous ways to evade \nthe human immune system, which makes it difficult to cure. But by developing ways to \nblock HIV replication, we can stop the spread of HIV itself. That’s where antiretrovirals–\na.k.a. ARVs– come in. ARVs are a group of drugs which work \nin different ways to combat HIV. Some block HIV’s access into immune cells, and others work by stopping the \nvirus itself from replicating. ARVs also work preventatively in people \nwho don’t have HIV. This type of approach is called \npre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. PrEP works by accumulating in a \nperson’s body and preventing HIV from \nestablishing itself. That means an HIV-negative person who may\nbe at risk of contracting the disease can take certain ARVs \nto protect themselves, before they become exposed. Here’s where it gets \nespecially interesting: In people with HIV, ARVs can also \ndramatically reduce HIV transmission. This is called “Treatment as Prevention.” On a global scale, this has the potential \nto end the HIV epidemic. It’s based on the idea that someone with\nHIV who takes ARV’s can lower the virus level in their bodies\nuntil it becomes undetectable. That doesn’t mean the virus is gone; it could still be lurking within cells, \nready to reactivate if treatment stops. But so long as it’s kept \ndormant with drugs, HIV remains undetectable. And when HIV is undetectable, \nit’s untransmittable, too. In theory this means that by testing \neveryone who’s at risk of HIV and treating those who test positive, we could stop transmission and \neventually eradicate HIV. In the real world, however, \nthings are more complex. Many at-risk HIV negative people across \nthe world do not have access to PrEP or ARVs, and those who are HIV positive may \nexperience challenges to taking ARVs. These problems are often greatest in \ncountries where the burden of HIV is highest. Getting these medications depends on \naccess to a functioning healthcare system– and this isn’t something everyone has. That’s part of the reason why stopping \nthe spread of HIV for good will require a significant investment of \nresources to improve those systems. One study carried out by the UNAIDS estimated that between 20-30 billion \ndollars per year would be needed to achieve \na nearly 90% reduction in new HIV infections by 2030. This investment would ensure more people\nwould get tested in the first place, and more would be able to access and \nmaintain treatment. Achieving this goal and improving \nhealthcare in general is in everyone’s best interest, from individual people to \nsociety as a whole. We have roadmaps that could allow us to bring the HIV epidemic to an \nend in the near future, with the possibility of eradicating the \ndisease altogether several generations in the future. In the period from 1996 to 2017 we almost halved the number \nof new HIV infections, and for the millions of people who still \nlive with the virus, ARV treatments enable most to lead long \nand healthy lives. With continued and increased investments, we can get transmission rates low enough\nto end HIV once and for all. A world without HIV is no longer \ninconceivable: it’s closer than ever. "

        "text": "bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms so they're one cell and they have the special property that they only have one piece of DNA so they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment they grow to twice their size they cut themselves down in the middle and one cell becomes two and so on and so on so they just grow and divide and grow and divide so kind of boring life except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters I know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how I think of you and so this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body so there's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do but you have ten trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life so 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being and so of course it's the DNA that counts so here's all the 80 G's and C's that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics so you have about 30,000 genes well it turns out you have a hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life and so at the best your 10% human we're more likely about 1% human depending on which of these metrics you like so I know you think of yourself as human beings but I think of you as ninety or ninety two point nine percent bacterial and these bacteria are not passive writers these are incredibly important they keep us alive they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and keep in our vital for keeping us alive and they never get any press for that but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well so there's all insert bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick and so the question from my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had is how could they do anything at all I mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see one they live this soaring sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they've always been to consider to be these a social reclusive organisms and so it seemed to us that they're just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way the bacteria live and the clue to this came from another marine bacterium and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri and so what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named Vibrio fischeri and this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light so we're not doing anything to the cells here we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see and was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light but when the bacteria made light what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in dilute suspension they made no light but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously and so the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community and then all do something together and what we figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other and they talk with a chemical language so this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell when it's alone it doesn't make any light but what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles and when the bacteria ours alone the molecules just float away and so no light but when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount that molecule increases in proportion to cell number and when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors they are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony and so that's how bioluminescence works they're talking with these chemical words and the reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology so again another plug for the animals in the ocean the real fish fry lives in this squid what you're looking at is the Hawaiian bobtail squid and it's been turned on its back and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these how's the Vibrio fischeri cells they live in there at high cell number that molecule is there and they're making light and the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light and so the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii so just in a sort of shallow knee-deep water and the squid is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps but then at night it has to come out to hunt and so on bright nights when there's lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in since it's just in those couple feet of water and what the squid has developed is a shutter they can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria and then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squids back so the squid doesn't make a shadow so it actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device and so it so predators can't see its shadow calculate its trajectory and eat it and so this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean but then if you think about it this squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying stick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that and so what happens is every morning when the Sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep it buries itself in the sand and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm and when the Sun comes up it pumps out like 95% of the bacteria and so now the bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule is gone so they're not making light but of course squid doesn't care it's asleep in the sand and as the day goes by the bacteria doubled they release the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it and so first we figured out how and this bacterium does this but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism and what we found so this is now supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells and so when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light and why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison and so now we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the vote and what's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence so it's not like a couple bacteria get in you and then they start secreting some toxins you're enormous that would have no effect on you you're huge but what they do we now understand is they get in you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launched their virulence attack together they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host so bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing and so that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules so these were the red triangles on my slides before and so this is the Vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with and then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered and what I hope you can see is that the molecules are related so the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species and what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages so each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for interest species communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's it like its language that allows it to count its own siblings and so once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but we started what we're really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that's depicted on this slide this is your skin so this is just a picture a micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there and so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria and it's about counting your neighbors it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual so they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication and so what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you and they take that in for Meishan inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population and so then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is so that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule and what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication so this is the bacterial Esperanto and so once we got that far we've started to learn the bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there's something practical that we can do here as well so I've told you the bacteria do you have all these social behaviors that they communicate with these molecules and of course I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing so we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics and of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug-resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria so they either pop the bacterial membrane they make that bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases so we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intra species communication system so we've made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they Jam recognition of the real thing and so by targeting the red system what we are able to do is to make species specific or disease specific anti quorum sensing molecules we've also done the same thing with the pink system we've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made in goodness of the interspecies communication system and these the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria and so to finish I'll just show you the strategy and this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same so what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it doesn't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies and so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide and what we now know is that if we treat the animal with the pathogenic bacterium a multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacterium in at the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives and so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance so what I hope you think is the bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about and of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular right and so in the spirit of Ted they are doing things together because it makes a difference right so what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals and what I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria had been on the year on the earth for billions of years humans a couple hundred thousands so we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular an organization works and and we think by studying bacteria we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body so we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from others so by using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you and again of course that's what we do both as Malec in in a molecular way and then also in an outward way but I think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body it's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is and what their tasks should be and so again we think that bacteria invented that and then you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study and then the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we've also made Pro quorum sensing molecules so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better and so remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in your on you keeping you healthy what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualist with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do by in here better than they would be on their own and then finally I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton New Jersey everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture and I hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child so science is done by that demographic there all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country and it's a really lucky demographic to work with I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age and it's just Anna crazy delightful job and I want to thank you for inviting me here it's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference you "

That doesn’t mean \nthere are necessarily too many cars to pass through a stretch \nof roadway smoothly, at least not if every driver maintains \nthe same consistent speed and spacing from other drivers. In this dense, but flowing, traffic, it only takes a minor disturbance \nto set off the chain of events that causes a traffic jam. Say one driver brakes slightly. Each successive driver then brakes \na little more strongly, creating a wave of brake lights \nthat propagates backward through the cars on the road. These stop-and-go waves \ncan travel along a highway for miles. With a low density of cars on the road, traffic flows smoothly \nbecause small disturbances, like individual cars changing lanes \nor slowing down at a curve, are absorbed by other \ndrivers’ adjustments. But once the number of cars \non the road exceeds a critical density, generally when cars are spaced \nless than 35 meters apart, the system’s behavior \nchanges dramatically. It begins to display dynamic instability, \nmeaning small disturbances are amplified. Dynamic instability isn’t unique \nto phantom traffic jams— it’s also responsible for raindrops, \nsand dunes, cloud patterns, and more. The instability is \na positive feedback loop. Above the critical density, any additional vehicle reduces \nthe number of cars per second passing through a given point on the road. This in turn means it takes longer \nfor a local pileup to move out of a section of the road, \nincreasing vehicle density even more, which eventually adds up \nto stop-and-go traffic. Drivers tend not to realize they need \nto break far in advance of a traffic jam, which means they end up having \nto brake harder to avoid a collision. This strengthens the wave of braking \nfrom vehicle to vehicle. What’s more, drivers tend to accelerate\ntoo rapidly out of a slowdown, meaning they try to drive faster than the average flow of traffic \ndownstream of them. Then, they have to brake again, \neventually producing another feedback loop that causes more stop-and-go traffic. In both cases, drivers make traffic worse simply because they don’t have a good\nsense of the conditions ahead of them. Self driving cars equipped with data \non traffic conditions ahead from connected vehicles \nor roadway sensors might be able to counteract \nphantom traffic in real-time. These vehicles would maintain \na uniform speed, safety permitting, that matches the average speed \nof the overall flow, preventing traffic waves from forming. In situations where there’s \nalready a traffic wave, the automated vehicle \nwould be able to anticipate it, braking sooner and more gradually \nthan a human driver and reducing the strength of the wave. And it wouldn’t take that many \nself-driving cars— In a recent experiment, one autonomous \nvehicle for every 20 human drivers was enough to dampen \nand prevent traffic waves. Traffic jams are not only \na daily annoyance– they’re a major cause of fatalities, wasted resources, \nand planet-threatening pollution. But new technology may help reduce \nthese patterns, rendering our roads safer, our daily commutes more efficient, \nand our air cleaner. And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers\naren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road \nconditions ahead— and drive accordingly.

        "text": "In a pitch-black cave,\nbats can’t see much. But even with their eyes shut, they can navigate rocky topography \nat incredible speeds. This is because a bat’s flight\nisn’t just guided by its eyes, but rather, by its ears. It may seem impossible to see\nwith sound, but bats, naval officers, and doctors\ndo it all the time, using the unique properties of ultrasound. All sound is created when\nmolecules in the air, water, or any other medium vibrate\nin a pulsing wave. The distance between each peak determines\nthe wave’s frequency, measured as cycles per second, or hertz. This means that over the same amount \nof time, a high frequency wave will complete \nmore cycles than a low frequency one. This is especially true of ultrasound, which includes any sound wave \nexceeding 20,000 cycles per second. Humans can't hear or produce sounds\nwith such high frequencies, but our flying friend can. When it’s too dark to see, he emits \nan ultrasound wave with tall peaks. Since the wave cycles are\nhappening so quickly, wave after wave rapidly bounces\noff nearby surfaces. Each wave’s tall peak hits\nevery nook and cranny, producing an echo that carries\na lot of information. By sensing the nuances \nin this chain of echoes, our bat can create an internal map \nof its environment. This is how bats use sound to see, and the process inspired humans\nto try and do the same. In World War One, French scientists\nsent ultrasound beams into the ocean to detect nearby enemy submarines. This early form of SONAR\nwas a huge success, in large part because sound waves \ntravel even faster through mediums with more tightly packed molecules, \nlike water. In the 1950s, medical professionals began\nto experiment with this technique as a non-invasive way to see\ninside a patient’s body. Today, ultrasound imaging is used\nto evaluate organ damage, measure tissue thickness, and detect \ngallbladder stones, tumors, and blood clots. But to explore how this tool\nworks in practice, let’s consider its most well-known use— \nthe fetal ultrasound. First, the skin is covered \nwith conductive gel. Since sound waves lose speed and clarity \nwhen traveling through air, this gooey substance ensures \nan airtight seal between the body and the wand \nemitting ultrasound waves. Then the machine operator begins sending\nultrasound beams into the body. The waves pass through liquids like urine,\nblood, and amniotic fluid without creating any echoes. But when a wave encounters a solid\nstructure, it bounces back. This echo is rendered as a dot \non the imaging screen. Objects like bones\nreflect the most waves, appearing as tightly packed dots \nforming bright white shapes. Less dense objects appear \nin fainter shades of gray, slowly creating an image \nof the fetus’s internal organs. To get a complete picture, waves need to reach different\ndepths in the patient’s body, bypassing some tissues \nwhile echoing off others. Since longer, low frequency waves \nactually penetrate deeper than short, high frequency ones, multiple frequencies \nare often used together and composited into a life-like image. The operator can then\nzoom in and focus on different areas. And since ultrasound machines send and \nreceive cascades of waves in real time, the machine can even visualize movement. The waves used for medical ultrasound\nrange from 2 million to 10 million hertz— over a hundred times higher\nthan human ears can hear. These incredibly high frequencies create\ndetailed images that allow doctors to diagnose \nthe smallest developmental deviations in the brain, heart, spine, and more. Even outside of pre-natal care, medical ultrasound has huge advantages\nover similar technologies. Unlike radiation-based imaging \nor invasive surgical procedures, ultrasound has no known negative \nside effects when used properly. At very high levels, \nthe heat caused by ultrasound waves can damage sensitive tissues, but technicians typically use\nthe lowest levels possible. And since modern ultrasound machines\ncan be small and portable, doctors can use them in the field— allowing them to see clearly\nin any medical emergency. "

        "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4OpBylwH9DU/hqdefault.jpg",
        "text": "One of the great things about science is that when scientists make a discovery, it's not always in a prescribed manner, as in, only in a laboratory\nunder strict settings, with white lab coats and all sorts of neat\nscience gizmos that go, \"Beep!\" In reality, the events and people involved in some of the major\nscientific discoveries are as weird and varied as they get. My case in point: The Weird History of the Cell Theory. There are three parts to the cell theory. One: all organisms are composed\nof one or more cells. Two: the cell is the basic\nunit of structure and organization in organisms. And three: all cells come\nfrom preexisting cells. To be honest, this all sounds\nincredibly boring until you dig a little deeper into how the world\nof microscopic organisms, and this theory came to be. It all started in the early 1600s\nin the Netherlands, where a spectacle maker\nnamed Zacharias Janssen is said to have come up\nwith the first compound microscope, along with the first telescope. Both claims are often disputed, as apparently he wasn't the only bored guy with a ton of glass lenses\nto play with at the time. Despite this, the microscope soon became a hot item that every naturalist or scientist\nat the time wanted to play with, making it much like the iPad of its day. One such person was a fellow Dutchman by the name\nof Anton van Leeuwenhoek, who heard about\nthese microscope doohickeys, and instead of going out and buying one, he decided to make his own. And it was a strange\nlittle contraption indeed, as it looked more like a tiny paddle\nthe size of a sunglass lens. If he had stuck two together, it probably would have made\na wicked set of sunglasses that you couldn't see much out of. Anyhoo, once Leeuwenhoek\nhad his microscope ready, he went to town, looking at anything and everything\nhe could with them, including the gunk on his teeth. Yes, you heard right. He actually discovered bacteria by looking at dental scrapings, which, when you keep in mind that people didn't brush their teeth\nmuch -- if at all -- back then, he must have had a lovely bunch\nof bacteria to look at. When he wrote about his discovery, he didn't call them bacteria,\nas we know them today. But he called them \"animalcules,\" because they looked\nlike little animals to him. While Leeuwenhoek was staring\nat his teeth gunk, he was also sending letters\nto a scientific colleague in England, by the name of Robert Hooke. Hooke was a guy who really loved\nall aspects of science, so he dabbled in a little bit\nof everything, including physics, chemistry and biology. Thus it is Hooke who we can thank\nfor the term \"the cell,\" as he was looking at a piece of cork\nunder his microscope, and the little chambers he saw\nreminded him of cells, or the rooms monks slept in\nin their monasteries. Think college dorm rooms, but without the TVs, computers\nand really annoying roommates. Hooke was something\nof an underappreciated scientist of his day -- something he brought upon himself, as he made the mistake of locking horns with one of the most famous\nscientists ever, Sir Isaac Newton. Remember when I said Hooke\ndabbled in many different fields? Well, after Newton published\na groundbreaking book on how planets move due to gravity, Hooke made the claim that Newton had been inspired\nby Hooke's work in physics. Newton, to say the least,\ndid not like that, which sparked a tense\nrelationship between the two that lasted even after Hooke died, as quite a bit of Hooke's research --\nas well as his only portrait -- was ... misplaced, due to Newton. Much of it was rediscovered,\nthankfully, after Newton's time, but not his portrait, as, sadly, no one knows\nwhat Robert Hooke looked like. Fast-forward to the 1800s, where two German scientists\ndiscovered something that today we might find rather obvious, but helped tie together\nwhat we now know as the cell theory. The first scientist\nwas Matthias Schleiden, a botanist who liked to study\nplants under a microscope. From his years of studying\ndifferent plant species, it finally dawned on him that every single plant he had looked at were all made of cells. At the same time, on the other end of Germany\nwas Theodor Schwann, a scientist who not only\nstudied slides of animal cells under the microscope and got a special type\nof nerve cell named after him, but also invented rebreathers\nfor firefighters, and had a kickin' pair of sideburns. After studying animal cells for a while, he, too, came to the conclusion that all animals were made of cells. Immediately, he reached out\nvia snail mail, as Twitter had yet to be invented, to other scientists working\nin the same field with Schleiden, who got back to him, and the two started working\non the beginnings of the cell theory. A bone of contention arose between them. As for the last part of the cell theory -- that cells come from preexisting cells -- Schleiden didn't exactly\nsubscribe to that thought, as he swore cells came\nfrom free-cell formation, where they just kind of spontaneously\ncrystallized into existence. That's when another scientist\nnamed Rudolph Virchow, stepped in with research showing\nthat cells did come from other cells, research that was actually --\nhmm ... How to put it? -- \"borrowed without permission\" from a Jewish scientist\nby the name of Robert Remak, which led to two more feuding scientists. Thus, from teeth gunk\nto torquing off Newton, crystallization to Schwann cells, the cell theory came to be\nan important part of biology today. Some things we know\nabout science today may seem boring, but how we came to know them\nis incredibly fascinating. So if something bores you, dig deeper. It's probably got a really weird\nstory behind it somewhere. "

        "text": "You’ve been chosen as a champion \nto represent your wizarding house in a deadly duel against\ntwo rival magic schools. Your opponents are fearsome. From the Newt-niz school, a powerful sorcerer wields a wand\nthat can turn people into fish, but his spell only works 70% of the time. And from the Leib-ton school, an even more powerful enchantress wields \na wand that turns people to statues, and it works 90% of the time. Lots are drawn, and you’re chosen \nto cast the first spell in the duel. The Newt-niz magician will go second, and the Leib-ton enchantress third, after which you’ll repeat casting in\nthat order until only one of you is left. The rules of magic duels are strict, and anyone who casts out of\norder immediately forfeits the duel. Also, to prevent draws, the rules stipulate that \nif everyone’s still standing at the end of the first round, you’ll all be turned into cats. Now, you must choose a wand. Your wizarding house presents you \nwith three options: the Bannekar, which binds \none target with vines and casts effectively 60% of the time, the Gaussian, \nwhich turns one target into a tree and works 80% of the time, and the incredibly rare Noether 9000, which banishes one target \nto a distant mountaintop and casts perfectly 100% of the time. Your opponents are masters of strategy, \nas well as sorcery, and you know they’ll make the choices that\nmaximize their own chances of success. Which wand should you choose and what strategy should you employ to have the greatest chance \nof winning the duel? Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You reach for the Noether 9000 first. After all, it makes sense to enter \nthe duel with the most powerful wand. But before you pick it up, you consider \nwhat would happen. As the most dangerous wizard, you’d also be the target \nof the other two magicians, and you’d need to take \ncare of the most dangerous of them first. But afterward, there’s a 70% chance you'd\nbe struck down by the remaining wizard. That’s trouble. Maybe it’s better to take the Gaussian. It works 80% of the time, which means you wouldn’t be a target\nuntil the enchantress was incapacitated. But if you succeeded in transforming her, you’d probably be turned \ninto a fish immediately after. If you transformed the sorcerer, the enchantress would almost \ncertainly turn you to stone. It would really be better if you missed. And that’s when you have an idea: what if you took the Gaussian, \nthen missed on purpose? Then, you would wait for the sorcerer \nto attack the enchantress, and you’d have an 80% chance \nof winning against the sorcerer. It’s a good idea, but there’s a problem; the sorcerer could also pass his turn and the enchantress, knowing that\nshe couldn’t pass without becoming a cat, would cast her spell on one of you. And since you’re the most dangerous \nbetween you and the sorcerer, you’d be the target. And that’s when you see \nwhat you really need to do: take the weakest wand, the Bannekar,\nand miss on purpose. Now the sorcerer knows that \nhe’ll be targeted by the enchantress and he’ll have to try to turn her into \na fish to avoid being turned into stone. Seventy percent of the time he’d succeed and you’d have a 60% chance \nof winning the duel at the beginning of the next round. If he fails, chances are he’ll be \nturned to stone and you’d still have a 60% chance of\nwinning the duel against the enchantress. There’s a slim 3% chance \nyou’ll all be turned into cats, but when everything’s accounted for, you have better than even odds \nof winning with this strategy. And that’s the best you can do. Here’s what the probability of winning \nfor the different strategies looks like. Who would’ve thought \nthat the best way to take your shot would be to throw away your shot? "

        "text": "On a tiny copper globe created\nin the early 1500s, the coast of Southeast Asia is marked \nwith a message that has since become iconic: Here be dragons. Though the words themselves\nwere actually quite rare, the sentiment was common among\nmedieval European mapmakers, who often scrawled dragons \nand sea monsters over terra incognita— blank spots on the map. For thousands of years, people all over \nthe world had made both functional maps— showing trade routes, settlements, \ntopography, water sources, the shapes of coastlines, \nor written directions— and what are known as cosmographies, illustrating the Earth \nand its position in the cosmos, often including constellations, gods, \nand mythic locations. From the Middle Ages\nthrough the mid-17th century, cartographers in Eurasia and North Africa\nproduced a slew of new world maps with features from both these traditions. Often commissioned by rulers\nand other powerful people, these maps were meant to depict\nthe world’s geography, but not necessarily to be\nuseful for navigation. And given their maker’s incomplete\nknowledge of the world, they were really hypotheses— some of which have been \nglaringly disproven. In medieval Europe, the new vogue began\nwith what were known as mappae mundi. Many of these veered closer\nto cosmographies, featuring the Garden of Eden\nor mythical dragons. They all followed the same format, showing the world's land as one mass\ndivided roughly into the shape of a T and surrounded by a ring of ocean. Islamic mapmakers also created\nworld maps in this format, emphasizing geographic details\nover fantastical elements. One of the earliest and most accurate such\nmaps was created by Ibn Hawqal, whose own travels informed\nhis mapmaking. In 1154, the King of Sicily commissioned\nIslamic mapmaker Al-Idrisi to create the “Tabula Rogeriana,” also known as “A Guide to Pleasant \nJourneys into Faraway Lands.” This book of maps included a world map\nbased on Idrisi’s own travel and interviews with other traders\nand travelers. He correctly depicted the world \nas a flattened sphere, but thought Europe, Asia, and North Africa\nwrapped all the way around it. The “Da Ming Hunyi Tu” was created \nin China in 1389 on a piece of silk big enough \nto fill an entire room. Though the mapmakers had \nnever been to Africa, they attempted to depict the continent based on the accounts of the traders\nwho’d been there. Surprisingly, this gave them enough\ninformation to create a correctly shaped portrayal \nof sub-Saharan Africa. Beginning in the 15th century, \nEuropean cartographers began to expand the scope of their world maps as their\nexplorers traveled the world— but not without missteps. In 1507, the German cartographer \nMartin Waldseemuller mapped the Americas— as a thin sliver of land \nwhere the east coast would be. Spanish cartographers took a stab \nat the western side of the Americas based on accounts from an expedition \nto the Baja Peninsula. Unfortunately, the explorers’ impressions \nof the land led them astray: for over 100 years after, Spanish maps \ndepicted the “Island of California” detached from the rest of the continent. The Flemish cartographer \nGerardus Mercator, best known for his world map, also created a map \nof the never-before-seen North Pole that was published in 1595. Mercator speculated that the North Pole \nprominently featured the “Rupes Nigra,” a giant magnetic rock\nsurrounded by a whirlpool that explained why all compasses \npoint north. Even as Europeans built towards \na complete picture of the Earth, they didn’t entirely let go of the idea \nof blank spots filled with mythic beasts. As late as 1657, English scholar \nPeter Heylin lumped Australia together with Utopia and Fairyland. But with the exception of the North Pole, these so-called terra incognita\nweren’t really unknown— at least not to the people\nwho lived there. There weren’t really dragons\nanywhere on Earth, but there were people and cultures— many of them eradicated by those \nwho put their lands on world maps. "

In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh\npainted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room\nat the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he'd admitted himself after\nmutilating his own ear in a psychotic episode. In \"The Starry Night,\"\nhis circular brushstrokes create a night sky filled\nwith swirling clouds and eddies of stars. Van Gogh and other Impressionists\nrepresented light in a different way than their predecessors, seeming to capture\nits motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in star light\nthat twinkles and melts through milky waves of blue night sky. The effect is caused by luminance, the intensity of the light\nin the colors on the canvas. The more primitive part\nof our visual cortex, which sees light contrast\nand motion, but not color, will blend two differently\ncolored areas together if they have the same luminance. But our brains' primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors\nwithout blending. With these two interpretations\nhappening at once, the light in many Impressionist works\nseems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly. That's how this\nand other Impressionist works use quickly executed\nprominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real\nabout how light moves. Sixty years later, Russian\nmathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical\nunderstanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy\nin a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to\nthe 5/3rds power of R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close\nto the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description\nof turbulence remains one of the unsolved\nproblems in physics. A turbulent flow is self-similar\nif there is an energy cascade. In other words, big eddies\ntransfer their energy to smaller eddies, which do likewise at other scales. Examples of this include\nJupiter's Great Red Spot, cloud formations\nand interstellar dust particles. In 2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists saw the eddies of a distant\ncloud of dust and gas around a star, and it reminded them\nof Van Gogh's \"Starry Night.\" This motivated scientists\nfrom Mexico, Spain and England to study the luminance\nin Van Gogh's paintings in detail. They discovered that there is a distinct\npattern of turbulent fluid structures close to Kolmogorov's equation\nhidden in many of Van Gogh's paintings. The researchers digitized the paintings, and measured how brightness varies\nbetween any two pixels. From the curves measured\nfor pixel separations, they concluded that paintings from\nVan Gogh's period of psychotic agitation behave remarkably similar\nto fluid turbulence. His self-portrait with a pipe, from\na calmer period in Van Gogh's life, showed no sign of this correspondence. And neither did other artists' work that seemed equally\nturbulent at first glance, like Munch's \"The Scream.\" While it's too easy to say\nVan Gogh's turbulent genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it's also far too difficult to accurately\nexpress the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gogh was somehow\nable to perceive and represent one of the most supremely\ndifficult concepts nature has ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind's eye with the deepest mysteries\nof movement, fluid and light.

        "text": "In 1945, two sculptures meant to represent\nthe average man and woman in the United States went on exhibit\nat the American Museum of Natural History. Based on measurements taken from tens\nof thousands of young men and women, they were called Norma and Normman. That same year, a contest launched\nto find a living embodiment of Norma. Normal is often used as a synonym\nfor “typical,” “expected,” or even “correct.” By that logic, most people should fit \nthe description of normal. And yet, not one of almost 4,000 women \nwho participated in the contest matched Norma,\nthe supposedly “normal” woman. This puzzle isn’t unique \nto Norma and Normman, either— time and time again, \nso-called normal descriptions of our bodies, minds, and perceptions \nhave turned out to match almost no one. And yet, a lot of the world is constructed\naround a foundation of normalcy. So what does normal actually mean—\nand should we be relying on it so much? In statistics, a normal distribution \ndescribes  a set of values that fall along a bell curve. The average, or mean, of all the values\nis at the very center, and most other values fall \nwithin the hump of the bell. These curves can be tall, with most values\ninside a narrow range, or long and flat, with only a slight bias\ntowards the average. What makes the distribution normal \nis that it follows this curved shape. Normal doesn’t describe a single data \npoint, but a pattern of diversity. Many human traits, like height,\nfollow a normal distribution. Some people are very tall or very short, but most people fall close \nto the overall average. Outside of statistics, normal\noften refers to an average— like the single number pulled \nfrom the fattest part of the bell curve— that eliminates all the nuance\nof the normal distribution. Norma and Norman’s proportions\ncame from such averages. Applied to individuals, \nwhether someone is considered normal usually depends on how closely \nthey hew to this average. At best, such definitions of normal \nfail to capture variation. But oftentimes, our calculations of normal\nare even more flawed. Take the BMI— or Body Mass Index. BMI is a measure of weight\nrelative to height, with different ratios \nfalling into “underweight,” “normal weight,” “overweight,”\nand “obese” ranges. Generally, only BMIs that correspond\nto normal weight are considered healthy. But BMI is not always \nan accurate predictor of health, or even of what’s a healthy weight. BMI doesn’t take into account \nbody fat percentage, body fat distribution, levels of physical\nactivity, or blood pressure. And yet, those who fall outside\nthe so-called normal range are commonly advised that losing\nor gaining weight will improve their health. When we apply a standard of normal\nto all of humanity that’s based on data \nfrom a non-representative slice, we’re not just choosing one\npoint on the distribution, we’re choosing it \nfrom the wrong distribution. A lot of behavior science research draws\nfrom samples that are pretty WEIRD— meaning Western, educated, \nindustrialized, rich, and democratic. These features can skew norms even in research that doesn’t have\nan obvious link to them. Take the famed \nMuller-Lyer optical illusion: it’s normal to think one \nof the two lines is longer, when they’re actually the same length. At least, it is if you’re\nan American undergraduate. A team of anthropologists \nand psychologists found other demographic groups\nwere much less susceptible— members of the San people of the Kalahari weren’t susceptible \nto the illusion at all. When these limited or inaccurate\ndefinitions of normal are used to make decisions \nthat impact people’s lives, they can do real harm. Historically, such concepts of normal\nhave been hugely influential. The Eugenics Movement of the early 20th \ncentury weaponized the concept of normal, using it to justify exclusion, violence, \nand even extermination of those deemed not normal. To this day, people are often targeted\nand discriminated against on the basis of disabilities, \nmental health issues, sexual orientations, gender identities, and other features\ndeemed “not normal.” But the reality is that the differences\nin our bodies, minds, perceptions, and ideas about\nthe world around us— in short, diversity— \nis the true normal.

        "text": "Historically, most cars have run \non gasoline, but that doesn’t have to be\nthe case in the future: other liquid fuels and electricity\ncan also power cars. So what are the differences \nbetween these options? And which one’s best? Gasoline is refined from crude oil, a fossil fuel extracted\nfrom deep underground. The energy in gasoline comes from a class\nof molecules called hydrocarbons. There are hundreds of different\nhydrocarbons in crude oil, and different ones are used \nto make gasoline and diesel— which is why you can't use\nthem interchangeably. Fuels derived from crude oil\nare extremely energy dense, bringing a lot of bang for your buck. Unfortunately, they have many drawbacks. Oil spills cause environmental damage\nand cost billions of dollars to clean up. Air pollution from burning \nfossil fuels like these kills 4.5 million people each year. And transportation accounts for 16%\nof global greenhouse gas emissions, almost half of which comes \nfrom passenger cars burning fossil fuels. These emissions warm the planet \nand make weather more extreme. In the U.S. alone,\nstorms caused by climate change caused $500 billion of damage \nin the last five years. So while gas is efficient, something so destructive\ncan't be the best fuel. The most common alternative\nis electricity. Electric cars use a battery pack\nand electric motor instead of the internal combustion engine\nfound in gas-powered cars, and must be charged at charging stations. With the right power infrastructure, they\ncan be as efficient as gas-powered cars. If powered by electricity generated\nwithout fossil fuels, they can avoid greenhouse gas emissions \nentirely. They’re more expensive \nthan gas-powered cars, but the cost difference has been\nshrinking rapidly since 2010. The other alternatives to gasoline\nare other liquid fuels. Many of these can be shipped and stored\nusing the same infrastructure as gasoline, and used in the same cars. They can also be carbon-neutral \nif they’re made using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere— meaning when we burn them, we release that\nsame carbon dioxide back into the air, and don't add to overall emissions. One approach to carbon-neutral fuel\nis to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combine its carbon\nwith the hydrogen in water. This creates hydrocarbons, \nthe source of energy in fossil fuels— but without any emissions if the fuels \nare made using clean electricity. These fuels take up more space than an energetically equivalent\namount of gasoline— an obstacle to using them in cars. Another approach is to make carbon-neutral\nfuels from plants, which sequester carbon from the air \nthrough photosynthesis. But growing the plants also has \nto be carbon neutral— which rules out many crops\nthat require fertilizer, a big contributor \nto greenhouse gas emissions. So the next generation of these fuels\nmust be made from either plant waste or plants that don't require\nfertilizer to grow. Biofuels can be about as efficient\nas gasoline, though not all are. For a fuel to be the best option, \npeople have to be able to afford it. Unfortunately, the high upfront costs\nof implementing new technologies and heavy subsidies for the producers \nof fossil fuels, mean that almost every green technology is more expensive than \nits fossil-fuel-based cousin. This cost difference is known\nas a green premium. Governments have already started\nsubsidizing electric vehicles to help make up the difference. In some places, depending \non the costs of electricity and gas, electric cars can already\nbe cheaper overall, despite the higher cost of the car. The other alternatives are trickier, \nfor now— zero-carbon liquid fuels can be\ndouble the price of gasoline or more. Innovators are doing everything\nthey can to bring green premiums down, because in the end, the best fuel \nwill be both affordable for consumers and sustainable for our planet. "

        "text": "Today ,more than half of all people in the world live in an urban area. By mid-century, this will increase to 70%. But as recently as 100 years ago, only two out of ten people lived in a city, and before that, it was even less. How have we reached such a high degree of urbanization, and what does it mean for our future? In the earliest days of human history, humans were hunter-gatherers, often moving from place to place in search of food. But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to learn the secrets of selective breeding and early agricultural techniques. For the first time, people could raise food rather than search for it, and this led to the development of semi-permanent villages for the first time in history. \"Why only semi-permanent?\" you might ask. Well, at first, the villages still had to relocate every few years as the soil became depleted. It was only with the advent of techniques like irrigation and soil tilling about 5,000 years ago that people could rely on a steady and long-term supply of food, making permanent settlements possible. And with the food surpluses that these techniques produced, it was no longer necessary for everyone to farm. This allowed the development of other specialized trades, and, by extension, cities. With cities now producing surplus food, as well as tools, crafts, and other goods, there was now the possibility of commerce and interaction over longer distances. And as trade flourished, so did technologies that facilitated it, like carts, ships, roads, and ports. Of course, these things required even more labor to build and maintain, so more people were drawn from the countryside to the cities as more jobs and opportunities became available. If you think modern cities are overcrowded, you may be surprised to learn that some cities in 2000 B.C. had population densities nearly twice as high as that of Shanghai or Calcutta. One reason for this was that transportation was not widely available, so everything had to be within walking distance, including the few sources of clean water that existed then. And the land area of the city was further restricted by the need for walls to defend against attacks. The Roman Empire was able to develop infrastructure to overcome these limitations, but other than that, modern cities as we know them, didn't really get their start until the Industrial Revolution, when new technology deployed on a mass scale allowed cities to expand and integrate further, establishing police, fire, and sanitation departments, as well as road networks, and later electricity distribution. So, what is the future of cities? Global population is currently more than 7 billion and is predicted to top out around 10 billion. Most of this growth will occur in the urban areas of the world's poorest countries. So, how will cities need to change to accommodate this growth? First, the world will need to seek ways to provide adequate food, sanitation, and education for all people. Second, growth will need to happen in a way that does not damage the land that provides us with the goods and services that support the human population. Food production might move to vertical farms and skyscrapers, rooftop gardens, or vacant lots in city centers, while power will increasingly come from multiple sources of renewable energy. Instead of single-family homes, more residences will be built vertically. We may see buildings that contain everything that people need for their daily life, as well as a smaller, self-sufficient cities focused on local and sustainable production. The future of cities is diverse, malleable, and creative, no longer built around a single industry, but reflecting an increasingly connected and global world. "

        "text": "In the mid-1970s, after decades \nof political turmoil, Greece finally seemed \nto be on the path to stability. With the introduction \nof a new constitution and negotiations underway \nto enter European institutions, many analysts expected Greek politics to follow the pattern \nof the larger Western world. Then in 1981, a political party \ncalled PASOK came to power. Its charismatic leader Andreas Papandreou\nrailed against the new constitution, and accused those in power \nof “national betrayal.” Opposing Greece’s membership in NATO\nand the European Economic Community, Papandreou promised to govern \nfor the betterment of the “common people\" above all else. He famously declared, “there are \nno institutions, only the people exist.” Papandreou’s rise to power \nisn’t a unique story. In many democratic countries \naround the world, charismatic leaders vilify \npolitical opponents, disparage institutions,\nand claim the mantle of the people. Some critics label this approach\nas authoritarian or fascist, and many argue that these leaders \nare using emotions to manipulate and deceive voters. But whether or not this style of politics\nis ethical, it's certainly democratic, and it goes by the name of populism. The term populism has been around\nsince Ancient Rome, and has its roots in the Latin word \n“populus” meaning “the people.\" But since then populism has been used \nto describe dozens of political movements, often with counterintuitive and sometimes\ncontradictory goals. Populist movements have rebelled \nagainst monarchies, monopolies, and a wide variety \nof powerful institutions. It’s not possible to cover \nthe full history of this term here. Instead, we’re focusing \non one specific type of populism— the kind that describes \nPapandreou’s administration and numerous other governments \nover the last 70 years: modern populism. But to understand how political theorists\ndefine this phenomenon we first need to explore \nwhat it’s responding to. In the aftermath of World War Two, many countries wanted to move away \nfrom totalitarian ideologies. They sought a new political system that prioritized individual \nand social rights, aimed at political consensus, \nand respected the rule of law. As a result, most Western nations adopted\na longstanding form of government called liberal democracy. In this context, “liberal” \ndoesn’t refer to any political party, but rather a type of democracy \nthat has three essential components. First, liberal democracies accept \nthat society is full of many, often crosscutting \ndivisions that generate conflict. Second, it requires that society’s \nmany factions seek common ground \nacross those divisions. Finally, liberal democracies rely \non the rule of law and the protection of minority rights, as specified in constitutions\nand legal statutes. Taken together, these ideals propose that tolerance and institutions \nthat protect us from intolerance, are the bedrock of a functional \nand diverse democratic society. Liberal democracies helped bring stability\nto the nations that adopted them. But like any system of government, \nthey didn’t solve everything. Among other issues, \nan ever-increasing wealth gap led to underserved communities who distrusted both their wealthy \nneighbors and their political leaders. In some cases, political corruption\nfurther damaged the public's trust. Growing suspicion and resentment \naround these politicians primed citizens to look \nfor a new kind of leader who would challenge \nestablished institutions and put the needs of the people first. In many ways, this reaction \nhighlights democracy in action: if the majority of a population feels\ntheir interests are underrepresented, they can elect leaders to change \nthat using existing democratic systems. But this is where assertive, modern \npopulist candidates can subvert democracy. Modern populists identify themselves \nas embodying the \"will of the people,\" and they place those interests above the institutions \nthat protect individual and social rights. Modern populists argue \nthese institutions are run by a self-serving ruling minority, who seek to control the vast majority\nof virtuous common people. As a result, politics is no longer about\nseeking compromise and consensus through tolerant democratic institutions. Instead, these leaders seek to overturn\nwhat they see as a broken system. This means that where a liberal democracy\nhas the utmost respect for institutions like courtrooms, free press, \nand national constitutions, modern populists disparage \nany establishment that disagrees with the so-called “common will.\" Modern populist parties \nhave arisen in many places, but the leaders of these movements\nare remarkably similar. They’re often charismatic individuals who identify themselves as embodying \nthe “will of the people.\" They make exorbitant promises \nto their supporters, while casting their opponents as traitors\nactively undermining the country. But whether these politicians are sincere\nbelievers or manipulative opportunists, the dynamics they unleash can be profoundly destabilizing\nfor liberal democracy. Even when modern populist leaders \ndon’t follow through with their most extreme promises, their impact on political discourse, \nthe rule of law, and public trust can long outlast their time in office.

She established this treehouse sanctuary after the robots freed everyone \nfrom having to work. It was meant to be a haven \nwhere people could follow their passions, take up crafts, and find fulfillment. Which they did… at first. Some years ago everyone forgot the point. They abandoned arts and crafts and instead just painted and exhibited \npictures of themselves over, and over, and over. The location of the second artifact \nis no secret; it’s in a tower, \nguarded by a garrison of bots, a bottomless ravine, \nand who knows what other traps. As soon as the tower \nwent up with the node inside, human communication \nacross the land went dark. Octavia’s been after it for years, but try as she might, \nthe defenses thwart her. In order to even get to the tower, \nthe team will need a distraction. Octavia has an idea: stir up the people \nthrough some well-intentioned vandalism. The residents’ paintings are all squares \nthat come in different sizes, all an odd number of pixels across. Helper-bots \npick up the finished portraits and hang them in public places \nfor everyone to admire. There’s a slim margin of time \nwhen Hedge can access the paintings. If he were to deface each one with an X, the people would blame the helper-bots, creating just the distraction \nthe team needs. If only it were so easy. Hedge can’t just paint an X— his painting processor \nrequires very specific instructions. Treating the paintings as square grids, he can fill in one pixel, \nor little square, at a time. He can move forwards \nand make 90 degree turns over the canvas, but can’t move diagonally. How does Ethic program Hedge \nto paint an X over each portrait? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Here’s a hint. Try drawing a square grid like this, and simulating Hedge’s path over it. What patterns can you find to guide him? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The challenge here \nis to craft a set of instructions that will work for any square grid. Fortunately, \none of the strengths of programming is the flexibility \nto solve not just one problem, but a whole class of them all at once. It often helps to start with one case, \nand work towards the general. Let’s say we had this square. Hedge can measure the length of its sides \nand store that number as a variable. Now, what we need is a plan \nfor how Hedge will paint an X, pixel by pixel. There’s more than one right answer \nfor how to do this; let’s look at two. First, what if Hedge went row by row, \nlike a typewriter? If it’s a 9 pixel by 9 pixel painting, in the first row he’d paint, \nskip 7, and then paint again. In the second row he’d skip the first, \npaint, skip 5, and paint. And so on. The pattern here is that for each row \nthe pixels skipped at the beginning go up by one, and the pixels skipped in the middle \ngo down by 2. Things get more complicated \nwhen Hedge reaches the center. Here there’s a row \nwith just one pixel painted. Then the whole thing reverses— the number of pixels skipped \ngoes down by one each time on the left, and up by two each time in the middle. Instructing Hedge to do this \nwith a series of loops will work and is a perfectly fine solution. The main drawback is that \nthis requires quite a bit of logic— knowing what to do in the middle, \nwhen to reverse the process, and exactly how to reverse it. So how might we approach this so that the logic remains consistent \nfrom start to finish? The key insight is to look at a grid \nas a series of concentric squares. Each square follows the same pattern— painted pixels in the corners, \nand unaltered pixels in between. So if we can figure out a way \nto paint one nested square, transition to the next, and repeat, \nwe can paint them all. Painting the outermost one is easy. Start in a corner and paint that pixel. If we call the length of the painting n, fly forward n minus 1 spaces. Paint another pixel, and turn right. Now do the whole thing again… and again. Now move forward one less space, \nturn right, fly forward once, and Hedge will be \nin the next concentric square and ready to repeat the whole process. Each square is n minus 2 pixels smaller \nthan the last in length and width, and we can follow this spiral pattern \nall the way to the center with a loop and a variable \nthat tracks how far Hedge should fly. Is one of these methods \nbetter than the other? It really depends on what you value. The strength of the spiral \nis the simplicity of finding a pattern and reusing the same logic \nfrom start to finish. The advantage of the typewriter approach is that it’s a more generalized solution, meaning it can be adapted \nmuch more simply to fill in any pattern. For Ethic’s sake, \neither will do just fine. So here’s what happens. Hedge rapidly defaces \nall of the portraits. And within moments cries of anguish \nbreak out all over the forest. The garrison guarding the tower \nabandon their posts to calm the agitated people, and Ethic, Hedge, \nand Octavia slip through— and nearly slip \ninto the depths of the gorge standing between them and the tower.

        "text": "Ok, \nso you, are a 4 billion year old\nmeat robot. Yeah, you heard me right. In fact, as you're made of \n30-ish trillion cells, and each of those have their own task, you're a robot made of trillions\nof mini robots- you are a mega-meat-bot! And your mission, for the past 4 billion \nyears or so- and for as long as you keep \nplaying this game of life- is to safeguard the code. To duplicate it. \nTo pass it on. The thing is, you're rubbish at \ncopying your own code. Every time it's copied, errors crop up. Not good when an error makes \na robot worse at surviving, but sometimes a mistake \nhelps them survive... and they pass that glitch in the code on- that's evolution in a nutshell, right? Which means you're not the result \nof some fancy design, I'm afraid. You're a result of billions of \nyears of bad copies. Go you. Another reason you're not totally awesome is because that megabot of yours \noften breaks down. Fortunately, cardiologists, immunologists, \nmicrobiologists- all the \"ists\"- have spent centuries figuring out \nour sensors and wiring so if something does go wrong, \nthey can usually fix it. Where they struggle, though, is when \nthe machinery turns on itself- when a copying error leads a cell \nto start dividing uncontrollably, to grow and multiply into a tumor. That's cancer. And sadly, even with the might \nof our modern medicine, some cancers evade treatment. But this is where a new band of \nbiologists step into the story: The \"Synthetic Biologists.\" These biohackers are mashing up science, \nmedicine and engineering to rewrite the code and fix \nthe un-fixable. Biohackers are going into a \npatient's genetic code and reprogramming their own immune system to recognize cancer cells \nand destroy them. It's called CAR T-cell therapy, \nand it's awesome. See, you're constantly under \nattack by pathogens- single-celled bacteria, viruses and fungi. Despite deciding, back in the day, to stay solo and not 'avengers assemble' \nlike you did, those pathogens see you, in all \nyour mega-meat-bot glory, as a fortress ripe for the plundering. Thankfully, you've got a security team \nin place to battle these invaders- your immune system- and some of it's top guards are \nyour white blood cells. They trawl the darkness \nthat is your inner space, checking the IDs of any cells they pass... although they're not name badges, but rather protein fragments on \nthe cell's surface called antigens. There are two types of these guards: \nT-cells and B-cells. T-cells check those antigen IDs \nusing special claws- receptors that lock with a \nparticular antigen. If they find a match, they attach and \nthey release toxic chemicals that burst open the \ninvading cell's membrane. Their B-cell workmates create antibodies- loads of small proteins, little claws that latch perfectly onto \na particular antigen, marking them for destruction. These two comrades have got your back and your immune system is brilliant at \nspotting and fighting pathogens that invade from outside. However, they're not so good at spotting your \nown cells that have gone rogue. The antigens on cancerous cells \ndon't look weird, they look a lot like your own cells, and the T's and B's aren't \nprogrammed to attack them. The usual way to deal with cancer is \nto try to cut the tumor out, or turn to radiotherapy and \nthen chemotherapy to destroy or block the \ngrowth of cancer cells, but if it's a blood cancer, if it's \nfloating around your whole body, you can't do that. And if the blood cancer actually starts in\nyour white blood cells- those key guards in your immune system- you'll really struggle to spot it. That's the case with acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia, and that's where CAR T-cell therapy \nis kicking butt. The biohackers are reprogramming a \npatient's own immune system to recognize particular antigens- those \nparticular protein fragments- on the cancer cells. To do it, you first need millions \nof a patient's T-cells Then, to get a T-cell to do \nsomething different, you need to replace its normal \ncode with something new, something you've designed. What synthetic biologists can now do\nwith DNA is super cool- they use a computer to put together \ntheir own sequences of bases- the chemical letters that spell \nout the DNA- then they model what that new genetic \ncode will do on a computer and then make those sequences \non a DNA printer- yeah, that's a thing!- printing not with ink, or with a plastic \npolymer like in a 3D printer, but with those fundamental \nbuilding blocks of life, with those A's and C's and T's and G's. The new code they designed for a \nT-cell has 3 key instructions: 1. It tells it how to recognize \nand kill a cancer cell. More specifically, how to modify an antibody- what the B-cells make to latch \nonto a target antigen. The antibody is modified to \nmake a new receptor that can detect the particular antigens \non the specific cancer. 2. It tells it to make copies of itself \nwhen it finds that cancer cell and 3. It tells it to survive \nin the patient's body. To get this new code into \nthe patient's T-cells, you use a vector- it's something that will easily \ninfect the T-cell and carry that bespoke DNA in with it. And voila! \nOne CAR T-cell. The name comes from a fire-breathing \nmonster from Ancient Greece, that had a lion's head, a goat's \nbody and a serpent's tail. It was called \"Chimera\"-\na name that has now come to be used for something that contains two or \nmore different types of tissues or cells. As this newly engineered cell's genetic \ncode is part T-cell, part antibody, it's a \"C\"himera and it goes in search \nof the cancer's \"A\"ntigen using its new \"R\"eceptor. Before you put the multiplied up \nT-cells back into the patient, you give them a mild dose of chemotherapy \nto wipe their existing T-cells. Then you simply reinsert the \nnow modified T-cells- the CAR T-cells- and they follow their normal DNA \nprogramming to move and search. However, thanks to their new \nbutt-kicking code, they've changed what they're looking for: they're now on a mission to find the \ncancerous cells and destroy them. Unlike conventional chemical-based drugs that get used up or excreted from \nthe body pretty quickly, CAR T-cells are living drugs that stay in \nthe patient's bloodstream for years. That's a huge pro. The flip side is that they're expensive- each CAR T-cell treatment is \nbespoke to the patient- and it's more difficult to get them to\nwork with common cancers like breast or lung, because you need a \nspecific antigen on the cancer cells for the CAR T-cell to target- and it's much easier to find \nthat in blood cancers. It's still early days, though, and there's an exciting \nfuture for CAR T-cell therapy. Researchers like Dr. Martin Pule \nand his team at UCL, are working on improving the leukemia \nand lymphoma treatments even further, and there's recently been some \npromising work on solid cancers. Thanks to CAR T-cell therapy, the survival rate for B acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia has improved hugely -nearly all patients go into remission- which means that leukemia cannot \nbe detected anymore- and most patients stay in remission. Biohacking is here, and it can reprogram your own \ngenetic code to enable your mega-meat-bot to do things it's never been \nable to do before! "

        "text": "As the sun rises over a quiet coral reef, \none animal breaks the morning silence. Named for their vibrant scales \nand beak-like teeth, these parrotfish are devouring \na particularly crunchy breakfast: rocks. It may not be immediately clear \nwhy any creature would take bites out of the seafloor. But the diet of these flashy foragers \nactually plays a key role in defending the coral reef’s \ncomplex ecosystem. Massive coral reefs \nbegin with tiny coral larvae, which settle on the seafloor’s \nhard surfaces and metamorphasize into coral polyps. Over time, these polyps \ngenerate rock-like skeletons made of calcium carbonate. Together, colonies of polyps produce \nlarge three-dimensional structures, which form the basis \nof an underwater metropolis. These coral complexes are full \nof nooks and crannies that house and protect \ncountless life forms. Even though coral reefs occupy less than \none percent of the ocean floor, these dense ecosystems are home to more \nthan twenty-five percent of marine life. Many fish use corals as shelters for \nsleeping and to hide from large predators between their trips foraging for seaweed. As the primary food source for many \nof the reef’s fish and invertebrates, seaweed is vital to this ecosystem. But in high densities, \nseaweed can become problematic, and even lethal to corals. Seaweed grows on the same hard open \nsurfaces that coral larvae rely on, and their growth prevents new coral \nfrom settling and expanding. These competitors have also evolved \na variety of ways to kill existing corals, including smothering and abrasion. Some seaweed species \neven engage in chemical warfare— synthesizing compounds \nthat destroy coral on contact. This is where parrotfish come in. Like many reef fish, \nthese colorful creatures eat seaweed. But unlike their neighbors, parrotfish can completely remove \neven the tiniest scraps of seaweed from the ocean floor. Their so-called beak is actually a mosaic \nof tightly-packed teeth which can scrape and grind rock, allowing them to consume every bit \nof seaweed covering a stony surface. This helps parrotfish reach seaweed \nother fish can’t consume, while simultaneously clearing out \nopen space for new corals to settle and existing colonies to expand. Eating rocks is just one way parrotfish \nhelp manage seaweed. Through a dynamic system \nof social networks, parrotfish can convey information \nto other coral dwelling fish. Each fish’s presence and simple routine \nbehaviors produce sensory information that nearby fish can see, hear, or smell. They can even detect changes in water \npressure produced by their neighbors using a special sensory organ. All these factors can inform \nthe behavior of nearby fish. For example, a fish safely entering \nan open feeding ground and not getting attacked \nmeans it’s safe to forage. Conversely, a fish rapidly leaving \na location can provide an early warning that a threat is approaching. By simply trying to stay alive, these reef fish can incidentally help \ntheir neighbors survive— and more of these fish \nmeans less seaweed. Unfortunately, human activities \nover the last several decades have disrupted almost every part \nof this complex system. In many coral reefs, overfishing \nhas reduced the number of parrotfish, as well as other seaweed eaters, \nsuch as surgeonfish and rabbitfish. This has led to unchecked seaweed growth, which threatens to degrade \nentire coral reefs. The parrotfish that remain \nlive in much smaller communities. Their reduced numbers \ncan weaken their social network, making surviving fish more timid \nand less effective at controlling seaweed. Today, climate change and pollution \nare lowering coral’s natural defenses while contributing to runaway \nseaweed growth— leaving reef ecosystems \nmore fragile than ever. Our reefs are vitally important \nto both marine and human life. Their unparalleled biodiversity offers \nunique opportunities for ecotourism, sustainable fishing, \nand scientific research, while their rocky structures guard \ncoastlines from waves and storm surges. Fortunately, continued research \ninto reef species like the quirky and critical parrotfish \ncan inform new strategies for preserving these essential ecosystems. "

        "text": "An elderly woman named Rosalie \nwas sitting in her nursing home when her room suddenly burst \nto life with twirling fabrics. Through the elaborate drapings, she could make out animals, children, and costumed characters. Rosalie was alarmed,\nnot by the intrusion, but because she knew this entourage \nwas an extremely detailed hallucination. Her cognitive function was excellent, and she had not taken any medications \nthat might cause hallucinations. Strangest of all, had a real-life crowd \nof circus performers burst into her room, she wouldn’t have been able to see them: she was completely blind. Rosalie had developed a condition known \nas Charles Bonnet Syndrome, in which patients with either impaired \nvision or total blindness suddenly hallucinate whole scenes \nin vivid color. These hallucinations appear suddenly, and can last for mere minutes \nor recur for years. We still don’t fully understand \nwhat causes them to come and go, or why certain patients develop them \nwhen others don’t. We do know from fMRI studies \nthat these hallucinations activate the same brain areas as sight, areas that are not activated \nby imagination. Many other hallucinations, \nincluding smells, sights, and sounds, also involve the same brain areas \nas real sensory experiences. Because of this, the cerebral cortex is\nthought to play a part in hallucinations. This thin layer of grey matter \ncovers the entire cerebrum, with different areas processing \ninformation from each of our senses. But even in people\nwith completely unimpaired senses, the brain constructs the world we perceive\nfrom incomplete information. For example, our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve \nblocks part of the retina. When the visual cortex processes light \ninto coherent images, it fills in these blind spots with \ninformation from the surrounding area. Occasionally, we might notice a glitch,\nbut most of the time we’re none the wiser. When the visual cortex is deprived \nof input from the eyes, even temporarily, the brain still tries \nto create a coherent picture, but the limits of its abilities \nbecome a lot more obvious. The full-blown hallucinations of\nCharles Bonnet Syndrome are one example. Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome \nonly occurs in people who had normal vision \nand then lost their sight, not those who were born blind, scientists think the brain uses\nremembered images to compensate for \nthe lack of new visual input. And the same is true for other senses. People with hearing loss \noften hallucinate music or voices, sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony \nof an entire marching band. In addition to sensory deprivation, recreational and therapeutic drugs, conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy, and psychiatric disorders \nlike schizophrenia, are a few of the many known causes \nof hallucinations, and we’re still finding new ones. Some of the most notorious hallucinations are associated with drugs \nlike LSD and psilocybin. Their hallmark effects include \nthe sensation that dry objects are wet and that surfaces are breathing. At higher doses, the visual world \ncan appear to melt, dissolve into swirls, or burst into fractal-like patterns. Evidence suggests these drugs also \nact on the cerebral cortex. But while visual impairment typically \nonly causes visual hallucinations, and hearing loss auditory ones, substances like LSD cause perceptual\ndisturbances across all the senses. That’s likely because they activate \nreceptors in a broad range of brain areas, including the cortical regions \nfor all the senses. LSD and psilocybin both function \nlike serotonin in the brain, binding directly to one type of\nserotonin receptor in particular. While serotonin’s role in the brain \nis complex and poorly understood, it likely plays an important part \nin integrating information from the eyes, nose, ears, and other sensory organs. So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin\ncause hallucinations by disrupting the signaling \ninvolved in sensory integration. Hallucinations associated \nwith schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those\ncaused by LSD and psilocybin. Patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels \nof serotonin in the brain. And antipsychotic drugs relieve \nsymptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin \nreceptors LSD and psilocybin bind to. And, in some cases, these drugs can even relieve \nthe hallucinations of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome. We’re still a long way from understanding \nall the different causes and interconnected mechanisms \nof hallucinations. But it’s clear that \nhallucinatory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary\nperception than we once thought. And by studying hallucinations, we stand to learn a great deal about how our brains construct \nthe world we see, hear, smell, and touch. As we learn more, we’ll likely come to appreciate\njust how subjective and individual each person’s island universe \nof perception really is. "

Yet look back 100 years and\nthe technologies we take for granted today would seem like impossible magic. So will there be a point where we reach an\nactual limit of technological progress? And if so, are we anywhere\nnear that limit now? Half a century ago, Russian\nastronomer Nikolai Kardashev was asking similar questions when he came up with \na way to measure technological progress; even when we have no idea exactly\nwhat it might look like. Anything we do in the future\nwill require energy. So Kardashev’s scale classifies\npotential civilizations, whether alien civilizations out there\nin the universe or our own, into three levels based\non energy consumption. The tiny amount of energy we currently\nconsume pales next to what we leave untapped. A type I, or planetary civilization, can \naccess all the energy resources of its home planet. In our case, this is the \n174,000 terawatts Earth receives from the sun. We currently only harness about\n15 terawatts of it, mostly by burning solar energy\nstored in fossil fuels. To approach becoming \na type I civilization, we would need to capture solar energy \nmore directly and efficiently by covering the planet with solar panels. Based on the most optimistic models, we might get there \nwithin just four centuries. What would be next? Well, the Earth only\ngets a sliver of the sun’s energy, while the rest of its 400 yottawatts\nis wasted in dead space. But a type II, or stellar civilization, would make the most \nof its home stars energy. Instead of installing solar\npanels around a planet, a type II civilization would install\nthem directly orbiting its star, forming a theoretical structure\ncalled a Dyson sphere. And the third step, \na type III civilization, would harness all the energy\nof its home galaxy. But we can also think of progress\nin the opposite way. How small can we go? To that end, British cosmologist \nJohn Barrow, classified civilizations \nby the size of objects they control. That ranges from mechanical structures \nat our own scale, to the building blocks of our own biology,\ndown to unlocking atoms themselves. We’ve currently\ntouched the atomic level, though our control remains limited. But we potentially could go much smaller\nin the future. To get a sense of the extent \nto which that’s true, the observable universe is 26\norders of magnitude larger than a human body. That means if you zoomed \nout by a factor of 10, 26 times, you’d be at the scale of the universe. But to reach the minimum length scale\nknown as the Planck length, you would need to zoom in 35 times. As physicist Richard Feynman once said, there’s plenty of room at the bottom. Instead of one or the other, \nit’s likely that our civilization will continue to develop along both \nKardashev and Barrow scales. Precision on a smaller scale\nlets us use energy more efficiently and unlocks new energy sources like\nnuclear fusion or even antimatter. And this increased energy lets us expand\nand build on a larger scale. A truly advanced civilization then\nwould harness both stellar energy and subatomic technologies. But these predictions weren't\nmade just for us humans. They double as a possible means \nof detecting intelligent life in the universe. If we find a Dyson sphere \naround a distant star, that's a pretty compelling sign of life. Or what if instead of a structure\nthat passively soaked up all of a star’s energy like a plant, an alien civilization built one \nthat actively sucked the energy out of the star like a hummingbird? Frighteningly enough, we’ve observed\nsuper dense celestial bodies about the size of a planet that drain \nenergy out of a much bigger star. It would be much too premature to conclude\nthat this is evidence of life in the universe. There are also explanations \nfor these observations that don’t involve alien life forms. But that doesn’t stop us from asking:\nwhat if? "

Now, the monument draws nearly\n3 million people to South Dakota’s Black Hills every year. But its façade belies a dark history. About 10,000 years ago, Native American\npeople began inhabiting the Black Hills. The area became especially sacred\nto the Lakota people, who formed the western branch \nof what the US called the Sioux Nation. The Lakota believed one cave \nwithin the Black Hills to be where they first emerged. And they named one \nof the Black Hills mountain peaks the Six Grandfathers \nafter their sacred directional spirits. But in the 1800s, Lakota access \nto this land came under threat. White settlers in North America \nexpanded their territories by using physical violence or negotiating \nwith Indigenous peoples. After its establishment in the late 1700s, the US government ratified hundreds \nof treaties with Native American nations. However, it often broke them \nor created them using coercion. Between 1866 in 1868, the Lakota\nand their allies successfully defended their land \nfrom the U.S. military and negotiated a new treaty\nwith the government. In the 1868 Treaty at Fort Laramie, all parties agreed that a vast territory,\nincluding the Black Hills, belonged to the Sioux Nation. In return, the Lakota would allow \nUS travelers to pass safely through. But many aspects of the Treaty\nalso aimed to assimilate the Lakota into white culture. This included incentives to convert\nthem from hunting to farming, abandon their nomadic lifestyle, \nand wear clothes the US provided. Meanwhile, just seven years later,\nthe US broke the treaty after an expedition found gold \nin the Black Hills. Miners set up camps, the military attacked and ultimately\ndefeated the Lakota, and the US passed legislation\nillegally seizing the land. 50 years later, \nworkers began etching into the Lakota’s \nsacred Six Grandfather’s Mountain. The project was led by an arrogant\nsculptor named Gutzon Borglum, who had ties to the KKK. A historian originally proposed that \nMount Rushmore include Western figures— like Lakota Chief Red Cloud. But Borglum chose to feature\nhis own heroes. By October of 1941, Borglum had died from\nsurgical complications and work stopped, though the project was unfinished. None of the four figures had torsos, \nas intended, and rubble was left piled below. To the Lakota, the monument \nwas a desecration. And the presidents immortalized \non the rockface all had brutal anti-Indigenous legacies. Members of the Iroquois Confederacy called\nGeorge Washington “Town Destroyer” for encouraging military campaigns \nthat burned 50 of their villages in 1779. Theodore Roosevelt championed \nforced assimilation and said, “I don’t go so far as to think that the\nonly good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of 10 are.” In 1980, after the Sioux Nation had sued\nthe US for treaty violations, the Supreme Court ruled that the \nBlack Hills had been unlawfully taken, and the Sioux were entitled \nto compensation. The amount named has since reached\nover a billion dollars. But the Sioux Nation refused \nto take the money and to give up their claim\nto the Black Hills, maintaining that they were never for sale. So, what should happen to Mount Rushmore\nand the Black Hills? Responses to that question\nare wide-ranging. Some, including tribal leaders \nand Borglum’s great-granddaughter, have called for Mount Rushmore\nto be removed. Others see it as an important\npatriotic symbol and vital aspect of South Dakota's\neconomy that should remain. Many Lakota people want \nthe 1868 Treaty to be honored and the now-federally controlled lands to\nbe returned to their tribal communities. Others have said that the Lakota \nand the US should at least co-manage parts of the Black Hills. Currently, there are no plans for change. The US broke many of its promises \nwith Indigenous nations making issues like this common. Native people have been fighting\nfor broken treaties to be honoured for generations, achieving some major victories \nalong the way. Meanwhile, if untouched, the faces engraved \non the Six Grandfathers Mountain are expected to remain \nfor thousands of years to come. "

        "text": "For almost a decade, scientists chased \nthe source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains \nand most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: \nin the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic \nof severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes \nthat look like a crown— or \"corona\" in Latin. There are hundreds \nof known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, \nand can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, \nMERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes \nthe disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, \nfour cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections \nof the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, \nand cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, \nhas features of each: it spreads easily, \nbut can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, \ndroplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when\nthe droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best \nin enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing\nfrom drying out, enabling the virus to survive \nfor longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight \nmay damage it. These seasonal variations matter more \nfor established viruses. But because no one is yet immune \nto a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it\ndoesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed\nin the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack \nthe host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses \nor DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, \nwith fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts \nand replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have \na proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have \nmistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless \nor even harmful. But some make the virus better suited\nfor certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus \njumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses \nthat caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, \nand the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, \nor strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences \nfrom most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, \nmeaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity \nfor harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, \ncoronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication \nerrors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses \nmuch more stable, with a slower mutation rate, \nthan other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate \nis actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems \ncan recognize germs and destroy them more quickly \nif they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus \nless recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs \nand vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored \nvery specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine\nevery year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly \nthat new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate \nof coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, \nand vaccines might be able to recognize them \nfor longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies\nremain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment\nor vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating \nthe ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing\ntreatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those \ntreatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach \non other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus \njumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, \nit doesn’t have to be devastating.

        "text": "More than 2,500 years ago, one of ancient Greece’s most celebrated \npopstars and erotic poets enraptured listeners. In one legend, a prominent Athenian heard\nhis nephew singing one of their songs and enjoyed it so much that he asked \nthe boy to teach it to him— “So that I may learn it and die,” he said. So, who was this revered figure? Her name was Sappho. She lived on the Greek island \nof Lesbos around 600 BCE. Like other singer-songwriters of the time, she sang while playing the lyre, a stringed instrument from which\nthe term “lyrics” is derived. But Sappho lyrics offered a uniquely\nintimate perspective on love, passion, and longing. She’s the first on record to combine the \nwords “bitter” and “sweet,” for instance, to describe at once the thrills \nand devastations of romance. Sappho was an aristocrat thought\nto have married a man, though none of her surviving\nwork mentions him. It does reference other family\nas well as festivals, colorful clothing, and growing old. But Sappho is best known for her lyrics\nabout homoerotic desire for women. In one song, as her female companion\ndeparts tearfully, Sappho says, “let me remind you /\n... the lovely times we shared.” She describes flower garlands, perfumes,\n“and,” she says, “on soft beds / \n... you quenched your desire.” In another, she describes \na friend in a distant city, “Pacing far away, her gentle heart\ndevoured by powerful desire, she remembers slender Atthis.” The word “Lesbian” means \nsomeone from Lesbos, but, because of Sappho, \nit now also describes a woman who’s gay. In ancient Greece, the norm was \nfor everyone to marry and have children. While men were usually permitted to have\nhomosexual relationships based on their status, \nwomen weren’t. But it appears that, \non Lesbos at this time, aristocratic women generally\nhad more freedom. Yet the details of Sappho’s\nlife remain mysterious, partially because only fragments \nof her poetry survive. In ancient times, however, \nso much of it persisted that it seemed it would last forever. Admirers performed Sappho cover songs\nand committed her poetry to papyrus, parchment, and pottery. Three centuries after Sappho’s death, a Greek author declared that her words\nwould endure “as long as ships sail from the Nile.” Another century later, the Library of  Alexandria housed \nnine scrolls of her work, numbering over 10,000 lines. But natural forces eroded the collection. And monks, tasked with preserving \nancient writing, likely neglected or destroyed her work. One 2nd century Christian leader \ncalled Sappho “a whore who sang about her\nown licentiousness.” Later, a Pope and Archbishop\nordered her poetry burned. Almost all of it had vanished\nby the Middle Ages. Then, about a century ago, people began rediscovering \nSappho’s poetry— in locations like an ancient Egyptian \ngarbage dump. Now, we have around 700 lines, representing less than 10%\nof Sappho’s total known work. We only have one complete poem of hers. About a dozen others are substantial,\nbut most are mere fragments. New pieces of Sappho’s songs \nprobably will be found. Some may already be sitting \nin museum archives, to be revealed when technology \nallows scholars to read through scrolls \ntoo fragile to unroll. What we are currently left \nwith is an incomplete record— and many historical rumors. Ovid insisted that Sappho fell \nin love with a ferryman and, upon being rejected,\nleapt from a cliff to her death. Another tale asserts that she ran \na girls’ school and those mentioned in her poems\nwere merely students for whom she felt platonic affection. Current consensus is that these stories, which ridicule Sappho \nor deny her work’s homoeroticism, are probably all untrue artifacts\nof misogyny and homophobia. Despite the distortions \nof the intervening millennia, Sappho’s words reach across time\nand resonate today. More than 2,000 years ago, she wrote: “I say someone in another time \nwill remember us” And, thankfully, we do. "

Instead of thick fur covering our bodies, many of us mainly have hair \non top of our heads— and a few other places. So, how did we get so naked? \nAnd why do we have hair where we do? Human hair and animal fur \nare made of the same stuff: filaments of the protein keratin that grow\nout of organs known as follicles, which go through cycles \nof growth and shedding. Across mammalian species, hairs have been \nmodified for numerous purposes, ranging from the soft fluff \ncovering rabbits to the rigid quills protecting porcupines. But for many mammals, \nhair grows in two layers consisting of a shorter undercoat \nof ground hairs covered by longer guard hairs. Together, they help insulate \nthe animal’s body and protect its skin. Human hairs, on the other hand, are \nkind of a combination of these hair types. Unfortunately, \nhair is rarely found in fossils, making it hard for researchers\nto pinpoint when and how our ancient ancestors lost their coats. But scientists have developed\nsome working hypotheses. It seems that, \nmillions of years ago in Africa, early hominins first transitioned out of\ntrees and adopted a more active lifestyle. Keeping cool became \nincreasingly important. Eventually, they developed\nmore sweat glands, which helped them lose heat by evaporating\nmoisture through the skin. In fact, humans have 10 times more sweat\nglands than chimpanzees, for instance. But efficiently losing heat by sweating is\nharder to do when you’re covered in fur. Scientists believe that early humans\nlost much of their coat around this time to help their sweat evaporate faster. However, if losing our hair\nwas so advantageous, why do we have any left at all? It seems that there are unique uses \nfor hair in different parts of our bodies. When it comes to the tops of our heads, temperature regulation \nlikely played a part again. Since early humans\nbegan venturing into the open, their heads would’ve been exposed\nto the scorching sun. Thicker, longer-growing hair protects\nour sensitive scalps and keeps our brains from overheating. Dark tightly curled hair is most effective\nat keeping solar radiation off of skin. Other kinds of head hair evolved\nas humans moved to different places. Meanwhile, researchers think eyebrows \nare especially useful for communication because they sit atop active facial\nmuscles that convey our feelings. Eyelashes have been shown to minimize\nairflow over our eyeballs, preventing them from drying\nout and catching debris. And maybe facial hair proved helpful in\ndistinguishing identity from a distance, but we really don’t know. Evidence is stubbly at best. Why we have hair in other regions is...\nmore pungent. Our armpits, nipples, and pubic areas\nare dotted with apocrine glands. They produce oily, smelly secretions\nwhich the thick, curly hair that often grows in these spots \nhelps disperse. The secretions that waft off these hairy\npatches may be useful for identification. For example, several studies have shown\nthat people are able to identify their own armpit odors as well as those\nof people they’re close with. The final type of notable human hair is\nthe vellus hair that covers our bodies. We don't know if these hairs serve\nany purpose themselves, but the follicles vellus hair grows from\nare essential banks of stem cells that repair damaged skin after injury. They’re also important sites \nof nerve endings that convey signals of gentle touch to the brain. In fact, although it’s much finer, humans have roughly the same density \nof body hair as apes of comparable sizes. So despite all this talk\nof human nakedness, we're not actually as hairless as we look. "

It was written in response\nto the British occupation, and as a result of the colonists\nhaving to house -- or quarter -- soldiers in their homes\nduring the American Revolution. Because of this amendment, our government can never force us\nto house soldiers in our home. The Fourth Amendment\nis the right to search and seizure. The police can't come into our home\nwithout a search warrant and take our personal property. Today, many concerns have arisen\nabout our rights to privacy in technology. For example, can the government track\nyour location with your smartphone, or can social media postings\nsuch as on Facebook and Twitter be used without a warrant? On to the Fifth:\nIt's all about due process. You've probably heard the phrase\n\"I plead the Fifth\" in movies or on TV. They're talking about the Fifth Amendment, which says that you don't have to take\nthe witness stand against yourself if you may end up incriminating yourself. OK, we're halfway done. The Sixth and Seventh Amendments\nare about how the legal system works. If you're accused of a crime, you have the right to a speedy\npublic trial and an impartial jury. You also have the right to a lawyer, and the right to take\nthe stand if you choose. This is important because it will prevent\nthe accused from sitting in prison forever and insists that the prosecution\nproceed with undue delay. The Seventh says you have\nthe right to a jury trial, where 12 impartial peers decide\nyour innocence or guilt in the courtroom, as opposed to a judge doing it all alone. The Eight Amendment prohibits\ncruel and unusual punishment. Is the death penalty cruel? Is it unusual? It's hard for Americans to agree\non the definitions of cruel and unusual. The Ninth and Tenth Amendments\nare called the non-rights amendments. They say that the rights\nnot listed in the Bill of Rights are retained by the people in the states. We have other rights\nthat are not listed in the Constitution, and the states have the right\nto make their own policies, like instituting state taxes. So now you know all 10 amendments. Can you remember them all? If not, remember this: the Bill of Rights is a crucial piece\nof American history, and though society\nhas undergone many changes these past 200 and some years, the interpretation and application\nof these amendments are as vital today as they were when they were written.

        "text": "On October 21st, 1909, 125 residents \nof an affluent Minneapolis neighborhood approached William Simpson,\nwho’d just bought a plot in the area, and told him to leave. The Simpsons would be the second \nBlack family in the otherwise white neighborhood,  \nwhere they intended to build a home. When the Simpsons refused offers \nto buy them out, their neighbors tried blocking\ntheir home’s construction. They finally moved into their house, \nbut the incident had a ripple effect. Just a few months \nafter the mob harassed the Simpsons, the first racially restrictive covenant\nwas put into place in Minneapolis. Covenants are agreements in property deeds\nthat are intended to regulate how the property is to be used. Beginning in the mid-1800s, people in the United States and elsewhere\nbegan employing them in a new way: specifically, \nto racially restrict properties. They wrote clauses into deeds that were \nmeant to prevent  all future owners from selling or leasing \nto certain racial and ethnic groups, especially Black people. Between 1920 and 1950, these racial covenants spread\nlike wildfire throughout the US, making cities more segregated \nand the suburbs more restricted. In the county encompassing Minneapolis, racial covenants eventually appeared \non the deeds to more than 25,000 homes. Not only was this legal, but the US Federal Housing Administration promoted racial covenants \nin their underwriting manual. While constructing new homes, real estate developers began racially\nrestricting them from the outset. Developments were planned as dream\ncommunities for American families— but for white people only. In 1947, one company began building\nwhat became widely recognized as the prototype of the postwar American\nsuburb: Levittown, New York. It was a community \nof more than 17,000 identical homes. They cost around $7,000 each \nand were intended to be affordable for returning World War II veterans. But, according to Levittown’s \nracial covenants, none of the houses could “be used or occupied by any person \nother than members of the Caucasian race,” with one exception: servants. Between 1950 and 1970, the population of the American suburbs\nnearly doubled as white people flocked \nto more racially homogenous areas in a phenomenon known as “white flight.” The suburbs spread, replacing native ecosystems with miles\nof pavement and water-guzzling lawns. And their diffuse layout necessitated\ncar travel. American automobile production quadrupled\nbetween 1946 and 1955, cementing the nation's dependence on cars. Federal programs like the G.I. Bill\noffered American veterans favorable lending rates for buying homes. But it was difficult for people of color\nto take advantage of such resources. Racial covenants restricted them\nfrom certain neighborhoods. And, at the same time, government programs\nlabelled neighborhoods of color bad investments and often refused\nto insure mortgages in those areas. Therefore, banks usually wouldn’t lend\nmoney to people purchasing property in neighborhoods of color—\na practice that became known as redlining. So, instead of owning homes \nthat increased in value over time, creating wealth that could be passed\nto future generations, many people of color were forced\nto spend their income on rent. And even when they were able \nto buy property, their home’s value was less likely\nto increase. The suburbs boasted cul-de-sacs \nand dead ends that minimized traffic. Meanwhile, city planners often identified\nredlined neighborhoods as inexpensive areas \nfor industrial development. So, the massive freeway projects \nof the mid-20th century disproportionately cut \nthrough redlined neighborhoods, accompanied by heavy industry\nand pollution. As a result, many neighborhoods of color\nexperience higher rates of drinking water contamination, asthma,\nand other health issues. People targeted by racial covenants\nincreasingly challenged them in court and, in 1968, they were finally banned\nunder the Fair Housing Act. But the damage had been done. Racial covenants concentrated wealth\nand amenities in white neighborhoods and depressed the conditions \nand home values in neighborhoods of color. As of 2020, about 74% of white families \nin the US owned their homes, while about 44% of Black families did. That gap is greatest \nin Minnesota’s Twin Cities. Across the country,\nneighborhoods remain segregated and 90% of all suburban counties\nare predominantly white. Some landlords, real estate agents,\nand lenders still discriminate against people \nbased on race— rejecting them, steering them to and away \nfrom certain neighborhoods, or providing inaccessibly\nhigh interest rates. Gentrification and exclusionary \nzoning practices also still displace and keep people of color\nout of certain neighborhoods. Racial covenants are now illegal. But they can still be seen\non many housing deeds. The legacy of racial covenants is etched\nacross the pristine lawns of the American suburbs. It’s a footnote in the demographic divides\nof every city. And it’s one of the insidious architects\nof the hidden inequalities that shape our world. "

        "text": "In January of 1995, Russia detected\na nuclear missile headed its way. The alert went all the way\nto the president, who was deciding whether to strike back when another system contradicted\nthe initial warning. What they thought was the first missile\nin a massive attack was actually a research rocket\nstudying the Northern Lights. This incident happened \nafter the end of the Cold War, but was nevertheless one of the closest\ncalls we’ve had to igniting a global nuclear war. With the invention of the atomic bomb, humanity gained the power to destroy\nitself for the first time in our history. Since then, our existential risk— risk of either extinction or the unrecoverable collapse \nof human civilization— has steadily increased. It’s well within our power\nto reduce this risk, but in order to do so, we have to understand which \nof our activities pose existential threats now, \nand which might in the future. So far, our species has survived\n2,000 centuries, each with some extinction risk\nfrom natural causes— asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes,\nand the like. Assessing existential risk is \nan inherently uncertain business because usually when we try to figure out\nhow likely something is, we check how often it's happened before. But the complete destruction of humanity\nhas never happened before. While there’s no perfect method to\ndetermine our risk from natural threats, experts estimate it’s about \n1 in 10,000 per century. Nuclear weapons were our first\naddition to that baseline. While there are many risks associated\nwith nuclear weapons, the existential risk comes\nfrom the possibility of a global nuclear war that leads\nto a nuclear winter, where soot from burning cities\nblocks out the sun for years, causing the crops that humanity\ndepends on to fail. We haven't had a nuclear war yet, but our track record is too short to tell\nif they’re inherently unlikely or we’ve simply been lucky. We also can’t say for sure whether a global nuclear war\nwould cause a nuclear winter so severe it would pose an existential threat\nto humanity. The next major addition to our existential\nrisk was climate change. Like nuclear war, \nclimate change could result in a lot of terrible scenarios \nthat we should be working hard to avoid, but that would stop short of causing\nextinction or unrecoverable collapse. We expect a few degrees\nCelsius of warming, but can’t yet completely \nrule out 6 or even 10 degrees, which would cause a calamity of possibly\nunprecedented proportions. Even in this worst-case scenario, it’s not clear whether warming would pose\na direct existential risk, but the disruption it would cause\nwould likely make us more vulnerable to other existential risks. The greatest risks may come \nfrom technologies that are still emerging. Take engineered pandemics. The biggest catastrophes in human history\nhave been from pandemics. And biotechnology is enabling\nus to modify and create germs that could be much more deadly\nthan naturally occurring ones. Such germs could cause pandemics \nthrough biowarfare and research accidents. Decreased costs of genome sequencing\nand modification, along with increased availability\nof potentially dangerous information like the published genomes \nof deadly viruses, also increase the number of people\nand groups who could potentially create\nsuch pathogens. Another concern is unaligned AI. Most AI researchers think this will be\nthe century where we develop artificial intelligence\nthat surpasses human abilities across the board. If we cede this advantage, we place\nour future in the hands of the systems we create. Even if created solely with humanity’s \nbest interests in mind, superintelligent AI could pose \nan existential risk if it isn’t perfectly aligned \nwith human values— a task scientists are finding\nextremely difficult. Based on what we know at this point, some experts estimate the anthropogenic\nexistential risk is more than 100 times higher \nthan the background rate of natural risk. But these odds depend heavily\non human choices. Because most of the risk is from human\naction, and it’s within human control. If we treat safeguarding humanity's future\nas the defining issue of our time, we can reduce this risk. Whether humanity fulfils its potential— or not— is in our hands. "

        "text": "Centuries ago, the Inca developed \ningenuous suits of armor that could flex \nwith the blows of sharp spears and maces, protecting warriors \nfrom even the fiercest physical attacks. These hardy structures \nwere made not from iron or steel, but rather something unexpectedly soft: \ncotton. These thickly woven, \nlayered quilts of cotton could distribute the energy from a blow \nacross a large surface area, shielding warriors \nwithout restricting their mobility. These seemingly contradictory features— strength and flexibility, \nsoftness and durability— have their roots in the intricate biology \nof the nearly invisible cotton fiber. These fibers begin life \ndeep within a cotton flower, on the surface of a seed. As many as 16,000 fibers \nwill festoon a single seed, bulging from the seed’s surface \nlike miniature water balloons. Each cotton fiber, \nno matter how large it grows, is made of just one cell. That cell has multiple layers \nof cell wall. After a few days, \nthe sides of the first layer, called the primary cell wall, stiffen, pushing cell growth \nin one direction and causing the fiber to elongate. The fiber elongates \nquickly for about 16 days. Then it begins the next stage: \nstrengthening the cell wall. It does this by making more \nof the carbohydrate cellulose. Cellulose will make up \n34% of the cell wall at this stage and swiftly increases. This new growth \nalso reinforces the cell wall by going against the grain \nof the existing wall. The strengthened wall is more rigid, \nrestricting further growth. That means if the fiber \nremodels its walls too early, it will be short, and ultimately make rough, weak fabrics. But if cell wall strengthening \nbegins too late, the wall won’t be sturdy enough— producing fibers that are too weak \nto hold fabrics together well. In ideal growing conditions— with the right temperature, water, \nfertilizer, pest control, and light— a cotton fiber can grow \nup to 3.6 centimeters long with only a 25 micrometer width. Long, fine fibers \ncan wrap around one another better than shorter, \nless fine fibers, which means those long, fine fibers \nmake stronger threads that hang together better as fabric. Cotton with these qualities \nhas diverse uses— from soft textiles \nto the U.S. dollar bill, which is 75% cotton. The next crucial stage \nof the cotton fiber’s growth begins as it thickens \nits secondary cell wall by depositing large quantities \nof cellulose into the secondary layer. Cellulose goes on to make up \nover 90% of the fiber’s weight. The more cellulose that gets deposited, the denser that secondary layer becomes— and this determines \nthe strength of the final fiber. This stage is essential \nfor developing long-lasting material for the likes of, say, a t-shirt. The garment’s capacity \nto withstand years of washing and wear is largely determined by the density \nof that secondary cell wall. On the other hand, its softness is strongly influenced \nby the length of the fiber, established with the remodeling \nof the primary wall layer. Finally, after about 50 days, \nthe fiber is fully grown. The living matter \nwithin the cell dies off, leaving behind only the cellulose. The dried cotton seed pod, or boll, \nthat surrounds the fibers cracks open, unveiling a burst of several thousand \nfiber cells in a fluffy mass. The thread-like fibers we see— \nthinner than a human hair— are the remains of those dense, \ndried out walls of cellulose. Tens of thousands of these fibers \nspun into yarn will go on to make everything from fabric,\nto coffee filters, diapers, and fishing nets. And with the help of modern science, cotton might soon be softer, stronger, \nand more resilient than ever as researchers investigate \nhow to optimize its growth based on nutrients, weather conditions, \nand genetics.

        "text": "Where did Russia come from, why is it so big, and what are the differences \nbetween it and its neighbors? The answers lie in an epic story\nof seafaring warriors, nomadic invaders, and the rise and fall of a medieval state\nknown as Kievan Rus. In the first millennium, a large group of tribes spread through\nthe dense woodlands of Eastern Europe. Because they had no writing system, much of what we know about them\ncomes from three main sources: archaeological evidence, accounts from literate scholars \nof the Roman Empire and the Middle East, and, lastly, an epic history called \nthe Primary Chronicle compiled in the 12th century \nby a monk named Nestor. What they tell us is that these tribes\nwho shared a common Slavic language and polytheistic religion had by the 7th century split into\nwestern, southern and eastern branches, the latter stretching from \nthe Dniester River to the Volga and the Baltic Sea. As Nestor's story goes, after years of\nsubjugation by Vikings from the north, who, by the way, did not wear \nhorned helmets in battle, the region's tribes revolted\nand drove back the Northmen, but left to their own devices, \nthey turned on each other. Such chaos ensued that, ironically, the tribes reached out to the foreigners\nthey had just expelled, inviting them to return \nand establish order. The Vikings accepted, sending a prince\nnamed Rurik and his two brothers to rule. With Rurik's son, Oleg, \nexpanding his realm into the south, and moving the capitol to Kiev, a former outpost of the Khazar Empire, the Kievan Rus was born, \"Rus\" most likely deriving from \nan old Norse word for \"the men who row.\" The new princedom had complex relations\nwith its neighbors, alternating between alliance and warfare\nwith the Khazar and Byzantine Empires, as well as neighboring tribes. Religion played an important \nrole in politics, and as the legend goes, in 987, the Rus prince Vladamir I decided\nit was time to abandon Slavic paganism, and sent emissaries \nto explore neighboring faiths. Put off by Islam's prohibition on alcohol and Judaism's expulsion \nfrom its holy land, the ruler settled on Orthodox Christianity after hearing odd accounts \nof its ceremonies. With Vladimir's conversion and marriage\nto the Byzantine emperor's sister, as well as continued trade \nalong the Volga route, the relationship between \nthe two civilizations deepened. Byzantine missionaries created an alphabet\nfor Slavic languages based on a modified Greek script while Rus Viking warriors served as the\nByzantine Emperor's elite guard. For several generations, the Kievan Rus flourished\nfrom its rich resources and trade. Its noblemen and noblewomen married\nprominent European rulers, while residents of some cities \nenjoyed great culture, literacy, and even democratic freedoms \nuncommon for the time. But nothing lasts forever. Fratricidal disputes over succession\nbegan to erode central power as increasingly independent cities\nruled by rival princes vied for control. The Fourth Crusade \nand decline of Constantinople devastated the trade integral \nto Rus wealth and power, while Teutonic crusaders \nthreatened northern territories. The final blow, however, would \ncome from the east. Consumed by their squabbles, Rus princes paid little attention \nto the rumors of a mysterious unstoppable hoard until 1237, when 35,000 mounted \narchers led by Batu Khan swept through the Rus cities, sacking Kiev before continuing \non to Hungary and Poland. The age of Kievan Rus had come to an end,\nits people now divided. In the east, which remained \nunder Mongol rule, a remote trading post, known as Moscow, would grow to challenge \nthe power of the Khans, conquering parts \nof their fragmenting empire, and, in many ways, succeeding it. As it absorbed other \neastern Rus territories, it reclaimed the old name \nin its Greek form, Ruscia. Meanwhile, the western regions\nwhose leaders had avoided destruction through political maneuvering \nuntil the hoard withdrew came under the influence of Poland\nand Lithuania. For the next few centuries, the former lands of Kievan Rus populated by Slavs, ruled by Vikings, taught by Greeks, and split by Mongols would develop differences in society,\nculture and language that remain to the present day.

        "text": "Transcriber: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You've probably heard of the Boston Tea Party, something about a bunch of angry colonists dressed as Native Americans throwing chests of tea into the water. But the story is far more complicated, filled with imperial intrigue, corporate crisis, smuggling, and the grassroots origins of the American Revolution. The first thing you need to know about tea in the 1700's is that it was really, really popular. In England, each man, woman, and child consumed almost 300 cups of this stuff every year. And, since the English colonized America, Americans were crazy about tea too. By the 1760's, they were drinking over a million pounds of tea every year. So, when Britain wanted to increase taxes on tea in America, people were not happy, mostly because they had no say in tax decisions made in London. Remember that famous phrase, \"No taxation without representation\"? The American colonists had long believed that they were not subject to taxes imposed by legislature in which they lacked representation. In fact, rather than paying the taxes, they simply dodged the tax collectors. Since the east coast of America is hundreds of miles long and British enforcement was lax, about 3/4 of the tea Americans were drinking was smuggled in, usually from Holland. But the British insisted that Parliament did have the authority to tax the colonists, especially after Britain went deeply into debt fighting the French in the Seven Years' War. To close the budget gap, London looked to Americans, and in 1767 imposed new taxes on a variety of imports, including the American's beloved tea. America's response: no thanks! They boycotted the importation of tea from Britain, and instead, brewed their own. After a new bunch of British customs commissioners cried to London for troops to help with tax enforcement, things got so heated that the Red Coats fired on a mob in Boston, killing several people, in what was soon called the Boston Massacre. Out of the terms of the 1773 Tea Act, Parliament cooked up a new strategy. Now the East India Company would sell the surplus tea directly through hand-picked consignees in America. This would lower the price to consumers, making British tea competitive with the smuggled variety while retaining some of the taxes. But the colonists saw through the British ploy and cried, \"Monopoly!\" Now it's a cold and rainy December 16, 1773. About 5,000 Bostonians are crowded into the Old South Meeting House, waiting to hear whether new shipments of tea that have arrived down the harbor will be unloaded for sale. When the captain of one of those ships reported that he could not leave with his cargo on board, Sam Adams rose to shout, \"This meeting can do no more to save the country!\" Cries of \"Boston Harbor a teapot tonight!\" rang out from the crowd, and about 50 men, some apparently dressed as Native Americans, marched down to Griffin's Wharf, stormed aboard three ships, and threw 340 tea chests overboard. An infuriated British government responsded with the so-called Coercive Acts of 1774, which, among other things, closed the port of Boston until the locals compensated the East India Company for the tea. That never happened. Representatives of the colonies gathered at Philadelphia to consider how best to respond to continued British oppression. This first Continental Congress supported destruction of the tea, pledged to support a continued boycott, and went home in late October 1774 even more united in their determination to protect their rights and liberties. The Boston Tea Party began a chain reaction that led with little pause to the Declaration of Independence and a bloody rebellion, after which the new nation was free to drink its tea, more or less, in peace.

        "text": "Meet our chemist, Harriet. She has a chemical reaction\nthat needs to occur more quickly. A chemist has some processes\nat her disposal that can help her speed up her reaction, and she knows of five ways. And to remember them, she thinks back to her days\nas a high school student, and the day she got a date for the dance. Harriet was in high school,\nstudying between classes. She had lost track of time\nand was going to be late to class. Unbeknownst to her, Harold, who was just around the corner,\nwas running late, too. They both sprinted to class and, as it happened, sprinted\ndirectly into one another. Now, this was no small collision. They ran squarely\ninto one another in such a way that he knocked the books\nright out of her hand. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"Let me\nhelp you with your books.\" He kindly helped her\nre-collect her belongings, and politely offered to walk her to class. And you'll never guess who went\ntogether to the dance later that year. Yup, those two. So as we can see from this example, the key to getting a date for the dance\nis to collide with someone and knock the books out of their hands. Now, you're probably already aware that not all collisions lead\nto dates for the dance, thankfully. The collisions must have\ntwo important characteristics: One, correct orientation that allows\nbooks to be knocked from one's hands; and two, enough energy\nto knock the books out. Shortly after this incident, Harriet decided to tell me,\nher chemistry teacher, all about it. I noticed some interesting parallels between her story\nand chemical reaction rates, which happened to be\nwhat she was studying in the hallway the day of the collision. Together, we decided\nto set out on two missions. Harriet wanted to help all\nchemistry students and chemists remember how to speed up\nthe rate of chemical reactions and I, being the nice guy that I am, decided to make it my mission\nto help create educational environments in which more book-dropping\ncollisions can take place to increase future chemists' chances\nof getting a date for the dance. In order to facilitate this improved\ndance-date-getting process, I propose five changes to all schools that parallel Harriet's five ways\nto increase chemical reaction rates. First, I propose that we shrink\nthe size of the hallways. This will make it more difficult\nto safely navigate the hallways and will cause more collisions\nthan in larger hallways. And by increasing\nthe number of collisions, we increase the likelihood that some of those collisions\nwill have the correct alignment and enough energy\nto create a date to the dance. Now, chemically speaking, this is equivalent to lowering\nthe volume of a reaction vessel or a reaction mixture. In doing so, the individual\nparticles are closer together, and more collisions will occur. More collisions means a greater likelihood that collisions with the appropriate\nenergy and configuration will happen. Second, I propose increasing\nthe overall population of the school. More students equals more collisions. By increasing the number of particles\navailable for collision, we create an environment\nwhere more collisions can take place. Third, we must reduce the time\nallowed between classes -- heck, let's just cut it in half. In doing so, students\nwill need to move more quickly to get from one class to the next. This increase in velocity\nwill help make sure collisions have the appropriate\namount of energy necessary to ensure book-dropping. This is analogous to increasing\nthe temperature of the reaction mixture. Higher temperature\nmeans particles are moving faster. Faster-moving particles means more energy, and a greater likelihood\nof the reaction-causing collision. Fourth, students must stop\ntraveling in packs. By traveling in packs,\nthe students on the outside of the pack insulate those in the middle\nfrom undergoing any collisions. By splitting up, each student\nhas more area exposed that is available for a collision\nfrom a passing student. When particles travel in packs,\nthe surface area is very small, and only the outside\nparticles can collide. However, by breaking up the clumps\ninto individual particles, the total surface area is increased, and each particle has\nan exposed surface that can react. Fifth and finally, we hire a matchmaker. Is this colliding\nand book-dropping too violent? Is there an easier way to get a date\nthat requires less initial energy? Then a matchmaker will help with this. The matchmaker makes it easier\nfor a couple to get together, by coordinating the match. Our matchmaker is like a catalyst. Chemical catalysts function\nby lowering the activation energy -- in other words, by lowering the energy\nrequired to start a reaction. They do this by bringing\ntwo particles together and orienting them correctly\nin space so that the two can meet at the correct configuration\nand allow a reaction to take place. So, to sum up: if a future chemist\nwants a date for the dance, he must collide with another person and knock the books out of their hands. And if a chemist wants to make\na chemical reaction occur, the particles must collide\nin the correct orientation with an appropriate amount of energy. And both of these processes\ncan be accelerated, using the five methods I've described. "

        "text": "In the 20th century, most vaccines took\nwell over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared \nthe threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed \nis a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s \nexisting cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without\never experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might\nbe able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these \nrevolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid,\nis a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions \nfor producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA, \na part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions\nto build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works\nin exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely\nintroduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions \nof mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is\nharmless by itself, but helpful for training \nour body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules \ninto a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller \nthan the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms\nthe membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been \nspecially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey \nthrough the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added:\nsugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact \nuntil they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a \ntemperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components\nbreak down. Once injected, the nanoparticles\ndisperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle\nfuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note \nthat while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material \nto alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and \nchemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components\nare present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome\ntranslates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein \nis one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus \nthis lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system\ncan be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, \nand muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean \nthe recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight\nthat viral protein, that will then stick around to defend \nagainst future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is\nlikely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce \nthe threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant\nadvantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain \nweakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive\nresearch to prepare and unique chemical treatments\nto safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually\ncontain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built \nfrom scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have\nroughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested\nvaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would \nidentify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA \ninto the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop\nnew vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool \nin the never-ending fight against disease. "

        "text": "What’s the best country \nin the world to live in? Is it the one with the best food?\nThe longest life expectancy? The best weather? For the past 70 years, most governments \nhave relied heavily on a single number to answer that question. This number influences elections, \nthe stock market, and government policy. But it was never intended\nfor its current purpose; and some would argue that the world \nis addicted to making it grow... forever. This number is called \nthe Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and it was invented by the economist\nSimon Kuznets in the 1930s, to try and gauge the size of an economy\nin a single, easy to understand number. GDP is the total monetary value \nof everything a country produces and sells on the market. To this day, GDP per capita, which is just the total GDP divided by the\nnumber of people living in that country, is widely seen as a measure of well-being. But GDP doesn’t actually say anything\ndirect about well-being, because it doesn't take into account\nwhat a country produces or who has access to it. A million dollars of weapons contributes \nthe exact same amount to a country’s GDP as a million dollars of vaccines or food. The value society derives from things\nlike public school or firefighters isn’t counted in GDP at all, because those\nservices aren’t sold on the market. And if a country has a lot of wealth, but most of it is controlled\nby relatively few people, GDP per capita gives a distorted picture\nof how much money a typical person has. Despite all that, for a long time, higher GDP did correlate closely\nto a higher quality of life for people in many countries. From 1945 to 1970, as GDP doubled,\ntripled or even quadrupled in some western economies, people’s wages often grew proportionally. By the 1980s, this changed. Countries continued to grow richer, but wages stopped keeping pace \nwith GDP growth, or in some cases, even declined, and most of the benefits went to an \never-smaller percentage of the population. Still, the idea of capturing\na nation’s well-being in a single number had powerful appeal. In 1972, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk\nof Bhutan came up with the idea \nof Gross National Happiness as an alternative \nto Gross Domestic Product. Gross National Happiness is a metric \nthat factors in matters like health, education, \nstrong communities, and living standards, having citizens answer questions like, “How happy do you think your family\nmembers are at the moment?” “What is your knowledge of names of plants\nand wild animals in your area?” and “What type of day was yesterday?” The United Nations’ Human Development\nIndex is a more widely used metric; it takes into account health\nand education, as well as income per capita \nto estimate overall well-being. Meanwhile, a metric called\nthe Sustainable Development Index factors in both well-being and the \nenvironmental burdens of economic growth, again, boiling all this down\nto a single number. Though no country has been able to meet the basic needs of its people while also using resources \nfully sustainably, Costa Rica currently comes the closest. Over the past few decades, it’s managed to grow its economy\nand improve living standards substantially without drastically increasing \nits emissions. Other countries,\nlike Colombia and Jordan, have made notable progress. Costa Rica now has better well-being\noutcomes like life expectancy than some of the world’s \nrichest countries. Ultimately, there are limits \nto any approach that boils the quality of life in a country \ndown to a single number. Increasingly, experts favor a dashboard\napproach that lays out all the factors a single number obscures. This approach makes even more sense given \nthat people have different priorities, and the answer to which country \nis best to live in depends on who’s asking the question. So what if that were you designing \nyour countries well-being metric? What do you value, \nand what would you measure? "

        "text": "Slavery, the treatment of human beings as property,\ndeprived of personal rights, has occurred in many forms \nthroughout the world. But one institution stands out for\nboth its global scale and its lasting legacy. The Atlantic slave trade, occurring from the late 15th\nto the mid 19th century and spanning three continents, forcibly brought more than 10 million Africans\nto the Americas. The impact it would leave affected\nnot only these slaves and their descendants, but the economies and histories\nof large parts of the world. There had been centuries of contact\nbetween Europe and Africa via the Mediterranean. But the Atlantic slave trade \nbegan in the late 1400s with Portuguese colonies in West Africa, and Spanish settlement \nof the Americas shortly after. The crops grown in the new colonies,\nsugar cane, tobacco, and cotton, were labor intensive, and there were not enough settlers \nor indentured servants to cultivate all the new land. American Natives were enslaved, \nbut many died from new diseases, while others effectively resisted. And so to meet the massive \ndemand for labor, the Europeans looked to Africa. African slavery had existed \nfor centuries in various forms. Some slaves were indentured servants, with a limited term \nand the chance to buy one's freedom. Others were more like European serfs. In some societies, slaves could \nbe part of a master's family, own land, and even rise \nto positions of power. But when white captains came offering \nmanufactured goods, weapons, and rum for slaves, African kings and merchants \nhad little reason to hesitate. They viewed the people they sold \nnot as fellow Africans but criminals, debtors, \nor prisoners of war from rival tribes. By selling them, kings enriched \ntheir own realms, and strengthened them \nagainst neighboring enemies. African kingdoms prospered \nfrom the slave trade, but meeting the European's massive demand\ncreated intense competition. Slavery replaced other criminal sentences, and capturing slaves \nbecame a motivation for war, rather than its result. To defend themselves from slave raids, neighboring kingdoms \nneeded European firearms, which they also bought with slaves. The slave trade had become an arms race, altering societies and economies \nacross the continent. As for the slaves themselves,\nthey faced unimaginable brutality. After being marched \nto slave forts on the coast, shaved to prevent lice, and branded, they were loaded onto ships \nbound for the Americas. About 20% of them \nwould never see land again. Most captains of the day \nwere tight packers, cramming as many men \nas possible below deck. While the lack of sanitation \ncaused many to die of disease, and others were thrown \noverboard for being sick, or as discipline, the captain's ensured their profits \nby cutting off slave's ears as proof of purchase. Some captives took matters \ninto their own hands. Many inland Africans \nhad never seen whites before, and thought them to be cannibals, constantly taking people away \nand returning for more. Afraid of being eaten, \nor just to avoid further suffering, they committed suicide \nor starved themselves, believing that in death,\ntheir souls would return home. Those who survived \nwere completley dehumanized, treated as mere cargo. Women and children were kept above deck\nand abused by the crew, while the men were made to perform dances in order to keep them exercised \nand curb rebellion. What happened to those Africans \nwho reached the New World and how the legacy of slavery \nstill affects their descendants today is fairly well known. But what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade\nhad on Africa's future. Not only did the continent lose\ntens of millions of its able-bodied population, but because most of the slaves \ntaken were men, the long-term demographic \neffect was even greater. When the slave trade was finally \noutlawed in the Americas and Europe, the African kingdoms whose economies \nit had come to dominate collapsed, leaving them open \nto conquest and colonization. And the increased competition \nand influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability \nthat continues to this day. The Atlantic slave trade also contributed\nto the development of racist ideology. Most African slavery had no deeper reason\nthan legal punishment or intertribal warfare, but the Europeans \nwho preached a universal religion, and who had long ago \noutlawed enslaving fellow Christians, needed justification for a practice so obviously at odds \nwith their ideals of equality. So they claimed that \nAfricans were biologically inferior and destined to be slaves, making great efforts \nto justify this theory. Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas\nacquired a racial basis, making it impossible for slaves \nand their future descendants to attain equal status in society. In all of these ways, the Atlantic slave trade \nwas an injustice on a massive scale whose impact has continued \nlong after its abolition. "

        "text": "In the 16th century, the mathematician\nRobert Recorde wrote a book called \n\"The Whetstone of Witte\" to teach English students algebra. But he was getting tired of writing\nthe words \"is equal to\" over and over. His solution? He replaced those words with\ntwo parallel horizontal line segments because the way he saw it,\nno two things can be more equal. Could he have used four line segments\ninstead of two? Of course. Could he have used vertical line segments? In fact, some people did. There's no reason why the equals sign\nhad to look the way it does today. At some point, it just caught on,\nsort of like a meme. More and more mathematicians\nbegan to use it, and eventually, \nit became a standard symbol for equality. Math is full of symbols. Lines, dots, arrows, English letters, Greek letters, superscripts, subscripts. It can look like an illegible jumble. It's normal to find this wealth\nof symbols a little intimidating and to wonder where they all came from. Sometimes, as Recorde himself\nnoted about his equals sign, there's an apt conformity\nbetween the symbol and what it represents. Another example of that \nis the plus sign for addition, which originated from a condensing\nof the Latin word et meaning and. Sometimes, however, the choice of symbol\nis more arbitrary, such as when a mathematician\nnamed Christian Kramp introduced the exclamation mark\nfor factorials just because he needed a shorthand\nfor expressions like this. In fact, all of these symbols \nwere invented or adopted by mathematicians who wanted\nto avoid repeating themselves or having to use a lot of words\nto write out mathematical ideas. Many of the symbols used\nin mathematics are letters, usually from the Latin alphabet\nor Greek. Characters are often found\nrepresenting quantities that are unknown, and the relationships between variables. They also stand in for specific numbers\nthat show up frequently but would be cumbersome or impossible\nto fully write out in decimal form. Sets of numbers and whole equations\ncan be represented with letters, too. Other symbols are used \nto represent operations. Some of these are especially valuable\nas shorthand because they condense repeated operations\ninto a single expression. The repeated addition of the same number\nis abbreviated with a multiplication sign so it doesn't take up more space\nthan it has to. A number multiplied by itself\nis indicated with an exponent that tells you how many times\nto repeat the operation. And a long string of sequential terms\nadded together is collapsed into a capital sigma. These symbols shorten\nlengthy calculations to smaller terms that are much easier to manipulate. Symbols can also provide \nsuccinct instructions about how to perform calculations. Consider the following set\nof operations on a number. Take some number that you're thinking of, multiply it by two, subtract one from the result, multiply the result of that by itself, divide the result of that by three, and then add one to get the final output. Without our symbols and conventions,\nwe'd be faced with this block of text. With them, we have a compact,\nelegant expression. Sometimes, as with equals, these symbols communicate meaning\nthrough form. Many, however, are arbitrary. Understanding them is a matter\nof memorizing what they mean and applying them in different contexts\nuntil they stick, as with any language. If we were to encounter\nan alien civilization, they'd probably have a totally\ndifferent set of symbols. But if they think anything like us,\nthey'd probably have symbols. And their symbols may even correspond\ndirectly to ours. They'd have their own multiplication sign, symbol for pi, and, of course, equals. "

        "text": "After stalking an unsuspecting cuttlefish\nacross the seafloor, this moray eel is finally ready to pounce. As the eel snags the mollusk\nin its long teeth, its prey struggles to escape. But before it can wriggle away, a second set of teeth lunge\nfrom the eel's throat, making short work of the captive\ncuttlefish. This adaptation is called\na pharyngeal jaw. And while it might seem more fitting\nfor an alien parasite than a fish, it's actually one of the most common\nadaptations under the sea. At some point millions of years ago, early fish evolved a jointed oral jaw\nfrom one of the bony arches that supported their frontal gills. This exterior, oral jaw was perfect\nfor capturing or chewing prey, but these early fish had a problem. They had no limbs to manipulate food\nwhile eating, making it easy for their mobile prey\nto escape before they took the first bite. Essentially, it was impossible for fish\nto capture and chew their prey at the same time with just one set\nof jaws. So to hold their food and eat it too, an even deeper gill arch evolved\ninto a secondary set of jaws. Unlike oral jaws connected\nby a bone joint, these pharyngeal jaws were suspended\nin muscle, offering them a wide range of motion\nto turn, tug, and tear on food. Some pharyngeal jaws actively chew, while others retract to pull chunks\nof food down the throat. Of course, the teeth a jaw has\nalso factor in here. For example, an oral jaw with fangs\nis exceptional for catching and holding on to fast-moving prey. But depending on what that prey is, a fish might want sharp pharyngeal teeth\nto tear through tissue, flat pharyngeal molars to grind\nplant matter, or a powerful pharyngeal bite\nto crush shelled prey. Fortunately some fishes can change\ntheir secondary teeth to match a new diet over several years. This flexibility allows fish to adapt and find food in a huge variety\nof aquatic environments. Some pharyngeal jaws have formed\nto eat food too hard for most fishes. California Sheephead use pointed teeth\nfrom their oral jaws to pry urchins off rocks before crushing\ntheir spiny exteriors in strong pharyngeal jaws that have fused\nwith the bones of their skulls. Other fish prioritize eating\nhuge quantities of food. The pharyngeal jaws of grass carp\nhave two bone components that move in unison to pull plant life\ninto their stomachs, consuming over 18 kilograms\nof seaweed a day. Other pharyngeal jaws are adapted\nto suit incredibly specific circumstances. Consider this species of pearlfish that\nlives inside sea cucumbers and feeds on their guts. Fish are the most diverse group\nof vertebrates with over 30,000 unique species, and much of that diversity is due\nto the hundreds of unique jaws separating otherwise identical species. Perhaps the best example of this\ndental diversity can be seen in cichlids. This family of fish is primarily found in\nselect African and South American lakes. Typically, large lakes like these\nwould be occupied by a handful of distantly related species, each adapted to consume one\nof the lake's limited food sources. But here, almost every corner\nof the ecosystem is occupied by a different species\nof cichlid. There are over 1,700 cichlid species, many almost identical save\nfor their uniquely adapted jaws which have evolved to eat crustaceans,\nmollusks, worms, algae, plankton, and even the scales of other fish. These oral adaptations are so essential\nfor survival, that different species use their\npharyngeal jaws to make unique mating sounds that allow female cichlids to identify\nmales of their own species. This technique limits\ninterspecies breeding, and ensures the parent fish will\npass on their specialized jaws. Scientists are still discovering\nall the ways this incredible skeletal mechanism\nfunctions. But given what we know already,\nit's fair to say that for most fish, two jaws are better than one. "

        "text": "After a harrowing chase, \nEthic, Hedge, and their new ally Lemma find themselves \nin a cavernous control room. Here the last artifact—\nthe Node of Memory— is suspended within a force field \nand powering a supercomputer. Ethic is about to deactivate the force\nfield when Lemma stops her. She explains, a decade ago, \nshe was assigned a research task: to use the world machine to create \nsomething that would make everyone happy. After many failed attempts, Lemma \ndiscovered a compound that, when ingested, made people motivated, happy, creative, \nloving… in short, their best selves. It was rushed into production. Soon, the entire nation’s food supply \ncame from Huxenborg, with the compound mixed in. The first year was paradise. The second, not so much. Side-effects began to emerge: memory-loss,\nlistlessness, and self-absorption. In the third year, \nthe government dissolved, leaving the robots running everything \nin a self-sustaining loop. By this point things were too far gone\nfor Lemma to reverse. People had become dependent \non the compound, and the few who refused it \nformed a resistance to try to fix things. It took 10 years for Lemma to find a cure. This factory contains everything \nshe’ll need to make it, but the second they take \nthe Node of Memory, the security system will alert the robots,\nand they’ll have to run. If, instead, they first reconfigure \nthe factory to manufacture the cure, the people can be saved. Lemma has the whole factory redesign \nplanned out. The problem is… \nit’s a little hard to read. Her schematic shows all the steps \nin the manufacturing process needed to make the cure. An arrow from “add nitric acid” \nto “shake vigorously” means that the acid addition \nhas to happen before shaking. If a single step is performed \nout of order, the cure won’t work, or worse. There aren’t any circular references,\nwhere step A requires step B and step B eventually requires step A. Here’s where Ethic and Hedge come in. Lemma needs Hedge to translate \nthe tangled diagram into a sequence of steps. That’ll be the order that things happen \nin the factory. Once input into the central computer, the factory will reassemble \nitself as instructed. Hedge’s ability to store information \nin a table will help here. So how does Ethic program Hedge \nto turn out a correct sequence that can reconfigure the factory? Pause now to figure it out yourself. Rules in 3 Rules in 2 Rules in 1 Hint in 3 Hint in 2 Hint in 1 It may help to first think about \nthis problem as a human, rather than a machine. Given this diagram, it’s clear to start \nwith getting a bowl, since no arrows point to it. How might you mark up the diagram \nto figure out what to do next? Pause now to figure it out yourself. Solution in 3 Solution in 2 Solution in 1 Diagrams like the one Lemma has drawn\nare called directed acyclic graphs. A graph is a representation of data \nthat shows different elements and how they’re related to each other. Directed means that direction matters—\nas indicated by the arrows. Here A leads to B, \nbut B doesn’t lead to A. And acyclic means that there \naren’t any loops. Which is fortunate, because if there were,\nthis problem wouldn’t be solvable. There’s a simple way to navigate \nthe graph as a human: start with a step that doesn’t have \nany arrows pointing to it. Once you do that, cross out that step \nand all arrows leading from it. Choose another step with no arrows \npointing to it, and repeat until you’ve hit every step. There are two things here that are tricky\nto translate for a robot. First, how do you keep track \nof the information? And second, what do you do if there\nare multiple options at the same time? For the first challenge, a convenient way for machines \nto store information is in a table. In this case, you can have Hedge \nlist every step in the headers of both the rows and columns. Then he can go through \nthe rows one at a time. On the schematic, what points to mix? Both shake and titrate. So Hedge should make a mark \nin both of their columns. He can do the same for every row, \none at a time, to make a table like this. Of course the full table \nwill be much bigger. Like a human, \nHedge will also want to start from one of the steps that has \nno arrows pointing to it— which is the same as having no marks \nin its row. If there’s more than one, a convenient way to choose is to pick \nthe one that’s alphabetically earliest, though other selection methods \ncan work just as well. Next, Hedge can add that step \nto his running-order list, delete its entire column from the table— thus removing all the times \nit was a dependency–– and loop back to the start. Because there are no circular \nreferences in the graph, each time we get here there’ll be at least\none step with no remaining dependencies. Hedge can add the alphabetically earliest \nto his running-order list, remove it from the table, \nand loop back to the start again. So now we have a working loop, and it’ll run through all the elements \nin our table until none are left. Hedge drifts back and forth \nover the schematics, and soon he starts spitting \nout instructions, which Ethic uses to configure \nthe assembly lines. With the three working together, they churn out thousands of doses \nof the cure in no time. Ethic finally plucks the Node of Memory from its holding field \nand trips the alarm. Within seconds bots are everywhere. As Ethic falls in shock, the Node \nrestores not only her own memories, but reveals the last, missing pieces\nof the puzzle. Ethic built Hedge with a singular purpose: to construct a maze that would protect \nthe world machine from a corrupt government. But in her haste, \nshe made a critical mistake. She forgot to set the condition \nthat would end the loop which told Hedge \nhow large the maze should be. So Hedge built and built \nuntil he could build no longer. And then he was conflicted. He had to build a maze. But he couldn’t build further \nwithout hurting people or flying over the Bradbarrier, both forbidden by his programming. So he wandered the land \nand searched for a solution, until he happened upon the Node of Power, \nthe Node of Creation, and the Node of Memory. He recognized their true, \ncollective power to grant self-awareness \nto those who lack it. With all three he’d be able \nto change his programming and fulfill his drive to transform \nthe entire world into a giant maze. It wouldn’t be easy: the Nodes had safeguards to prevent \nrobots from taking and using them. But if Hedge could find the right human and manipulate her \nwith the promise of a heroic quest… well that would be a different story. A very different story. "

        "text": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Great weather we're having! Awesome job! You're a tremendous athlete! Compliments, right? Well, maybe. Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines, they very well may be compliments. They may also be, though, pointed and attacking lines. This slight change of attitude behind the lines reveals what we call verbal irony. So when someone says, \"Great weather we're having,\" it is quite possible that the person really means that if the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the wind is calm. But if the weather is horrible, the clouds are looming, and the wind is a raging tempest, and someone says, \"Great weather we're having,\" he probably doesn't actually mean that. He probably means that the weather is horrible, but he has said the opposite. This is verbal irony when the speaker says the opposite of what he means. I know what you're thinking. Isn't this sarcasm, isn't the speaker being sarcastic? Yes. When a speaker says the opposite of what he means, that is verbal irony. When a speaker then goes the step farther to mean the opposite of what he says and seeks to be a little pointed and mean, like he's making fun of something, then you have sarcasm. Take the second example: \"Awesome job!\" Someone accomplishing his life-long dream: awesome! Someone winning a sports championship: awesome! Someone rear-ends another car: not awesome. So when the passenger says, \"Awesome job!\" they probably mean the opposite with a hint of poking fun. That is verbal irony and that is sarcastic. \"You're a talented athlete,\" said to an Olympian: authentic, no verbal irony present. Said to the klutzy kid tripping into English class and spilling his books and pencil case all over the room, now that is just harsh and verbally ironic because what you said is not what you meant. That is verbal irony. You have said the opposite of what you mean. Additionally, since you have the intention of mocking this poor person, you have not only been verbally ironic, but sarcastic as well. Beware, though. While all sarcasm fits the definition of verbal irony, not all verbal irony is sarcastic. Verbal irony is where what is meant is the opposite of what is said, while sarcasm adds that little punch of attitude. There are times, though, where another layer of meaning can be present without that sarcastic tone. Alright, now go out there and find those examples of verbal irony and sarcasm. Good luck! No, seriously, I mean it, good luck. No, no, really, I truly want to wish you luck on this difficult task. Ok, ok, sincerely good luck. You can do it! No verbal irony here. "

        "text": "A handful of species on Earth \nshare a seemingly mysterious trait: a menstrual cycle. We're one of the select few. Monkeys, apes, bats, humans,\nand possibly elephant shrews are the only mammals on Earth\nthat menstruate. We also do it more than any other animal, even though its a waste of nutrients\nand can be a physical inconvenience. So where's the sense in this\nuncommon biological process? The answer begins with pregnancy. During this process, the body's resources\nare cleverly used to shape a suitable environment for a fetus, creating an internal haven for a mother\nto nurture her growing child. In this respect, \npregnancy is awe-inspiring, but that's only half the story. The other half reveals that pregnancy\nplaces a mother and her child at odds. As for all living creatures, the human body evolved to promote\nthe spread of its genes. For the mother, that means\nshe should try to provide equally for all her offspring. But a mother and her fetus don't share\nexactly the same genes. The fetus inherits genes\nfrom its father, as well, and those genes can promote their own\nsurvival by extracting more than their fair share \nof resources from the mother. This evolutionary conflict of interests places a woman and her unborn child\nin a biological tug-of-war that plays out inside the womb. One factor contributing \nto this internal tussle is the placenta, the fetal organ that\nconnects to the mother's blood supply and nourishes the fetus while it grows. In most mammals, the placenta is confined\nbehind a barrier of maternal cells. This barrier lets the mother control\nthe supply of nutrients to the fetus. But in humans and a few other species, the placenta actually penetrates right\ninto the mother's circulatory system to directly access her blood stream. Through its placenta, the fetus\npumps the mother's arteries with hormones that keep them open to provide a permanent\nflow of nutrient-rich blood. A fetus with such unrestricted access\ncan manufacture hormones to increase the mother's blood sugar,\ndilate her arteries, and inflate her blood pressure. Most mammal mothers can expel\nor reabsorb embryos if required, but in humans, once the fetus is\nconnected to the blood supply, severing that connection \ncan result in hemorrhage. If the fetus develops poorly or dies, the mother's health is endangered. As it grows, a fetus's ongoing need\nfor resources can cause intense fatigue, high blood pressure, and conditions \nlike diabetes and preeclampsia. Because of these risks, pregnancy is always a huge, \nand sometimes dangerous, investment. So it makes sense that the body \nshould screen embryos carefully to find out which ones \nare worth the challenge. This is where menstruation fits in. Pregnancy starts with a process\ncalled implantation, where the embryo embeds itself\nin the endometrium that lines the uterus. The endometrium evolved to make\nimplantation difficult so that only the healthy embryos\ncould survive. But in doing so, it also selected for the most \nvigorously invasive embryos, creating an evolutionary feedback loop. The embryo engages in a complex,\nexquisitely timed hormonal dialogue that transforms the endometrium \nto allow implantation. What happens when \nan embryo fails the test? It might still manage to attach, or even get partly \nthrough the endometrium. As it slowly dies, it could leave \nits mother vulnerable to infection, and all the time, it may be emitting\nhormonal signals that disrupt her tissues. The body avoids this problem\nby simply removing every possible risk. Each time ovulation doesn't result\nin a healthy pregnancy, the womb gets rid \nof its endometrial lining, along with any unfertilized eggs,\nsick, dying, or dead embryos. That protective process \nis known as menstruation, leading to the period. This biological trait, \nbizarre as it may be, sets us on course \nfor the continuation of the human race. "

As we seriously consider the human\nspecies becoming space-faring, a big question stands. Even if we break free \nfrom Earth's orbit and embark on long-duration\njourneys among the stars, can we adapt to the extreme\nenvironments of space? This won't be the first time that humans\nhave adapted to harsh environments and evolved superhuman capabilities. Not fantastical powers like laser vision\nor invisibility, but physiological adaptations\nfor survival in tough conditions. For example, on the Himalayan mountains where the highest elevation \nis nine kilometers above sea level, an unacclimated lowland human\nwill experience symptoms of hypoxia, commonly known as mountain sickness. At these altitudes, the body usually\nproduces extra red blood cells, thickening the blood \nand impeding its flow. But Himalayans who have lived on\nthese mountains for thousands of years permanently evolved mechanisms\nto circumvent this process and maintain normal blood flow. Cases like that prove that humans\ncan develop permanent lifesaving traits. But natural adaptation \nfor entire human populations could take tens of thousands of years. Recent scientific advances may help us\naccelerate human adaptation to single generations. To thrive as a species \nduring space travel, we could potentially develop methods to quickly program protective abilities\ninto ourselves. A beta version of these methods\nis gene therapy, which we can currently use to correct\ngenetic diseases. Gene editing technology,\nwhich is improving rapidly, allows scientists to directly change\nthe human genome to stop undesirable processes\nor make helpful substances. An example of an unwanted process is what happens when our bodies\nare exposed to ionizing radiation. Without an atmospheric barrier\nand a magnetic field like Earth's, most planets and moons are bombarded\nwith these dangerous subatomic particles. They can pass through nearly anything and would cause potentially cancerous\nDNA damage to space explorers. But what if we could turn the tables\non radiation? Human skin produces a pigment\ncalled melanin that protects us from the filtered\nradiation on Earth. Melanin exists in many forms\nacross species, and some melanin-expressing fungi use the pigment to convert radiation\ninto chemical energy. Instead of trying to shield \nthe human body, or rapidly repair damage, we could potentially engineer humans to adopt and express these fungal,\nmelanin-based energy-harvesting systems. They'd then convert radiation into\nuseful energy while protecting our DNA. This sounds pretty sci-fi, but may actually be achievable \nwith current technology. But technology isn't the only obstacle. There are ongoing debates \non the consequences and ethics of such radical alterations\nto our genetic fabric. Besides radiation, variation in gravitational strength\nis another challenge for space travelers. Until we develop artificial gravity\nin a space ship or on another planet, we should assume that astronauts\nwill spend time living in microgravity. On Earth, human bone and muscle\ncustodial cells respond to the stress \nof gravity's incessant tugging by renewing old cells in processes\nknown as remodeling and regeneration. But in a microgravity environment\nlike Mars, human bone and muscle cells\nwon't get these cues, resulting in osteoporosis \nand muscle atrophy. So, how could we provide \nan artificial signal for cells to counteract bone and muscle loss? Again, this is speculative, but biochemically engineered microbes\ninside our bodies could churn out bone and muscle\nremodeling signaling factors. Or humans could be genetically engineered to produce more of these signals\nin the absence of gravity. Radiation exposure and microgravity\nare only two of the many challenges we will encounter in the hostile\nconditions of space. But if we're ethically prepared\nto use them, gene editing and microbial engineering\nare two flexible tools that could be adapted to many scenarios. In the near future, we may decide\nto further develop and tune these genetic tools\nfor the harsh realities of space living. "

        "text": "In February of 1942, \nMexican farmer Dionisio Pulido thought he heard thunder \ncoming from his cornfield. However, the sound wasn’t coming \nfrom the sky. The source was a large, smoking crack \nemitting gas and ejecting rocks. This fissure would come to be known as \nthe volcano Paricutin, and over the next 9 years, its lava \nand ash would cover over 200 square km. But where did this new volcano come from, and what triggered \nits unpredictable eruption? The story of any volcano \nbegins with magma. Often, this molten rock forms \nin areas where ocean water is able to slip into the Earth’s mantle \nand lower the layer’s melting point. The resulting magma typically remains \nunder the Earth’s surface thanks to the delicate balance \nof three geological factors. The first is lithostatic pressure. This is the weight of the Earth’s crust \npushing down on the magma below. Magma pushes back with the second factor, \nmagmastatic pressure. The battle between these forces \nstrains the third factor: the rock strength of the Earth’s crust. Usually, the rock is strong enough \nand heavy enough to keep the magma in place. But when this equilibrium is thrown off, \nthe consequences can be explosive. One of the most common causes \nof an eruption is an increase \nin magmastatic pressure. Magma contains various elements \nand compounds, many of which are dissolved \nin the molten rock. At high enough concentrations, compounds \nlike water or sulfur no longer dissolve, and instead form \nhigh-pressure gas bubbles. When these bubbles reach the surface, they can burst with the force \nof a gunshot. And when millions of bubbles \nexplode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash \ninto the stratosphere. But before they pop, they act \nlike bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda. Their presence lowers \nthe magma’s density, and increases the buoyant force \npushing upward through the crust. Many geologists believe this process \nwas behind the Paricutin eruption in Mexico. There are two known natural causes \nfor these buoyant bubbles. Sometimes, new magma \nfrom deeper underground brings additional gassy compounds \ninto the mix. But bubbles can also form \nwhen magma begins to cool. In its molten state, magma is a mixture\nof dissolved gases and melted minerals. As the molten rock hardens, some of those \nminerals solidify into crystals. This process doesn’t incorporate \nmany of the dissolved gasses, resulting in a higher concentration \nof the compounds that form explosive bubbles. Not all eruptions are due \nto rising magmastatic pressure— sometimes the weight of the rock \nabove can become dangerously low. Landslides can remove massive quantities \nof rock from atop a magma chamber, dropping the lithostatic pressure \nand instantly triggering an eruption. This process is known as “unloading” and it’s been responsible \nfor numerous eruptions, including the sudden explosion \nof Mount St. Helens in 1980. But unloading can also happen \nover longer periods of time due to erosion or melting glaciers. In fact, many geologists \nare worried that glacial melt caused by climate change \ncould increase volcanic activity. Finally, eruptions can occur when \nthe rock layer is no longer strong enough to hold back the magma below. Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma can corrode rock through a process \ncalled hydrothermal alteration, gradually turning hard stone \ninto soft clay. The rock layer could also be weakened \nby tectonic activity. Earthquakes can create fissures \nallowing magma to escape to the surface, and the Earth’s crust \ncan be stretched thin as continental plates \nshift away from each other. Unfortunately, knowing \nwhat causes eruptions doesn’t make them easy to predict. While scientists can roughly determine \nthe strength and weight of the Earth’s crust, the depth and heat of magma chambers \nmakes measuring changes in magmastatic pressure very difficult. But volcanologists are constantly \nexploring new technology to conquer this rocky terrain. Advances in thermal imaging \nhave allowed scientists to detect subterranean hotspots. Spectrometers can analyze \ngases escaping magma. And lasers can precisely track the impact \nof rising magma on a volcano’s shape. Hopefully, these tools will help us better\nunderstand these volatile vents and their explosive eruptions. "

        "text": "In 1944, 11 years before her fateful \ndecision on a Montgomery Bus, Rosa Parks was investigating \na vicious crime. As an emissary for \nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, she had traveled to rural Alabama \nto meet with Recy Taylor, a young woman who had been \nsexually assaulted by six white men. It would be difficult enough to convince\nan Alabama court that even one of these men was guilty, but Rosa was undeterred. She formed a committee to defend \nRecy in court, flooding the media with testimony and sparking protests \nthroughout the South. When a jury failed \nto indict the attackers, Parks demanded the governor \nassemble a new grand jury. She wrote, “I know that you will not fail\nto let the people of Alabama know that there is equal justice \nfor all of our citizens.” Throughout her life, Parks repeatedly \nchallenged racial violence and the prejudiced systems \nprotecting its perpetrators. But this work came at an enormous risk— and a personal price. Born in 1913, Rosa was raised by her \nmother and grandparents in rural Alabama. But outside this loving home, the fear \nof racial violence cast a long shadow. The Ku Klux Klan frequently \ndrove past their home, and Jim Crow laws \nsegregated public spaces. At 19 she settled in Montgomery\nand married Raymond Parks, a barber who shared her growing fury \nat racial injustice. He was involved with the local chapter\nof the NAACP; a role many avoided \nfor fear of persecution. At first Raymond was eager \nto keep Rosa safe from the potential dangers of activism. But as she grew more incensed at the\nlimitations imposed on African Americans, she could no longer stand by. When she officially joined \nthe NAACP in 1943, Parks and Johnnie Rebecca Carr were \nthe only women in the Montgomery chapter. She began keeping minutes \nfor their meetings, and soon found herself elected \nsecretary of the chapter— formally beginning her secret double life. By day, Rosa worked as a seamstress\nto support her mother and husband. By night, she researched and documented\nnumerous civil rights cases, from local policy disputes to high-profile\nmurder cases and hate crimes. As secretary, she prepared public \nresponses on behalf of the Montgomery chapter,\nbattling the harsh sentencing, false accusation and smear campaigns \nfrequently used against African Americans. In addition to her legal work, Parks \nwas a brilliant local strategist. As advisor to the NAACP \nyouth group council, she helped young people navigate \nsegregated systems including voter registration and \nwhites-only libraries. Through the cover of the NAACP, Parks strived to bring clandestine \ncivil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil disobedience\ntraining and spoke out against racial violence,\nparticularly the murder of Emmet Till. In 1955, her refusal to move \nto the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the grassroots movement \nshe had hoped for. Parks was arrested and jailed \nfor her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local activists. Together they planned a twenty-four \nhour bus boycott. It lasted for three hundred \nand eighty-one days. Park’s simple act had transformed \nnascent civil rights activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended \nwhen the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating \npublic transport. But this victory for the movement \nhad come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death \nthreats throughout the campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery\nbecause of her political reputation. In 1957, she moved to Detroit \nto continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by Congressman \nJohn Conyers to help support his burgeoning \ncivil rights campaigns. Ever vigilant in the fight against racial \ninequality, Parks remained active \nfor the next 40 years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks\nto support other activists, and established an institute \nfor the education of young people in her late husband’s memory. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered \nas a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful \npeople and policies. Her call to action continues to resound: “knowing what must be done\ndoes away with fear.” "

Cohen details the steps your body must take to find future fame as a fossil.\n\nLesson by Phoebe A. Cohen, animation by Anton Bogaty.",

        "text": "Imagine being a fossil: touring the world's great museums, inspiring awe in onlookers of all ages, posing for hordes of fawning photographers. Sound like something you'd like? Well, good luck! At least 99.9% of creatures that have ever lived aren't preserved in the fossil record. But forget about them, everyone else will, and listen up! If you want your corpse in the exclusive 0.01% Club, the Hall of Preserved Fossil Fame, it will not be easy. You better work! Step one: die. It's a cold, hard fact of fossilization. Everything paleontologists find was once alive and, at some point, died. We'll skip the details and assume you had a long, fulfilling life so we can get to what is really important -- how you die. There are many ways to become a fossil, so let's highlight your top death options. You could get yourself trapped in tree sap, which, when hardens, turns into amber and can survive intact for millions of years. But unless you find a really big tree to sit under, amber preservation will likely remain the domain of insects and other very small animals. Generally, the right place to be if you want to end up a fossil is wherever sediment is actively being deposited, like a lake or an ocean floor. A mountaintop or prairie? Not good! You need to get buried, the faster the better, because the longer you hang around on the surface, the more likely you'll get eaten, scavenged, or otherwise destroyed before ever having a chance to get preserved. If you can get buried someplace with little to no oxygen, like a bog or a deep lake bottom, even better. That lack of oxygen will slow down your decay and give you more time to fossilize. So, let's say you're lucky enough to die and get buried in a shallow sea under muddy, sandy sediments. What's your next move? One option is a process called permineralization. While all your soft parts decay away, your bones get saturated with mineral-rich waters. Bit by bit, microscopic crystals precipitate out of these waters to fill in the empty spaces and pores in your bones. Otherwise, you'd better hope the sediments around you harden while your bones decay away and another sediment or mineral fills in the spaces your bones leave behind, creating a perfect cast of your skeleton. Over time, the sediments around your fossil will lithify or turn into rock. But you're not in the clear yet! Many things could happen to those sedimentary rocks that might destroy your chances of getting discovered. They could get uplifted into a mountain range and eroded away or carried along in an oceanic plate and subducted back into the Earth's mantle, melting your fossil into hot mush. Fingers crossed your rock surroundings will get gently lifted up by plate tectonics, sea levels will change, and you'll end up under dry land close to the surface, but not so close that erosion from wind and rain wipes you away before someone can come find you. The last step in this long process, an intrepid paleontologist has to come find you. Maybe she's a research scientist scouting for fossils your age and type or just an amateur collector hoping for a fortuitous find. She whacks away at layers of rock above you or spots your fossil exposed in a creek bank after a flood. And there you are, a magnificent scientific discovery, millions of years in the making! She and her colleagues gently extract you from the surrounding sediment, measure and photograph all the bits and pieces they find, and begin the complex task of reconstructing how and when you lived based on the evidence they find in your bones. Paleontologists will be some of your biggest fans along with all those admiring crowds at the museum. You made it! You spent years underground in obscurity, shedding blood, sweat, tears, and your internal organs. You worked yourself to the bone until your bones disintegrated and were replaced by minerals and sediments. But it was all worth it because you're a famous fossil! Now, you better hold that pose! "

In Eatonville, Florida, \nthe storm forced many to flee. But for Janie Crawford, \nit inspired an unexpected homecoming. Janie’s return begins \n“Their Eyes Were Watching God,” Zora Neale Hurston’s acclaimed novel about a Black woman’s quest \nfor love and agency in a time that sought to deprive \nher of both. When Janie arrives back in Eatonville,\nher arrival is shrouded in mystery. Her neighbors and friends are quick\nto gossip about her reappearance, her finances, and most importantly, \nthe whereabouts of her missing husband. But only Janie’s friend Pheoby\ngets to hear the whole story. Over the course of a conversation \nthat spans most of the novel, Hurston untangles Janie’s life story; from her complicated childhood \nand her life in Eatonville, to her scandalous departure \nand the shocking events that followed. The specifics of Janie’s story\nare often larger than life, but many of the book’s details reflect \nthe incredible experiences of its author. Zora Neale Hurston was\nraised in Eatonville, one of the first planned and incorporated\nall-Black communities in America. Like Janie, she also left\nEatonville abruptly, traveling first to Jacksonville and DC,\nbefore eventually moving further north. In New York City, \nHurston studied anthropology and became a renowned author \nin the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural, literary and artistic movement\nthat’s still considered a golden era of Black artistry and creativity. Here, her work garnered enough support \nto fund research trips through the South, where she collected stories and folktales\nfrom Black Americans. By 1937, her fieldwork had taken\nher all the way to Haiti, where she wrote most \nof “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Hurston drew on all these experiences\nfor the novel, incorporating folkloric elements alongside\nher own family and romantic history to bring readers into the intimate spaces \nof Black southern life. She uses regional phrases and sayings to capture the dialect \nof her Floridian characters. And the novel’s omniscient \nthird-person narration allows Hurston to unleash \nher poetic prose on everything from birdsong, architecture, and fashion, to her characters’ deepest feelings \nand motivations. Perhaps more than any specific details, Hurston’s experiences of being \na Black woman in America at this time are more evident in the novel’s themes. Over the course of one long evening, Janie and Pheoby discuss the nature of\nfamily, marriage, spirituality and more. But their conversation always comes back\nto Janie’s truest desire: to live honestly \nand be truly loved in return. As a teenager, Janie resents \nan arranged marriage, despite the safety it offers her \nand the wishes of her loving grandmother. When her family becomes well-respected \nin Eatonville, she struggles with the\njudgmental eyes of strangers and a husband who wants her \nto be something she’s not. Throughout her life, Janie frequently\nfeels she’s at the whim of natural and spiritual forces that can shift the course of her existence\nwithout warning. And when she finally does find true love, these unknowable powers \ncontinue to act on her, threatening to destroy the life\nshe's so painstakingly built. The story takes place during a time where\nwomen had little to no agency, and Janie’s life is full \nof complicated characters who demand different kinds \nof love and submission. But despite the loneliness \nof her situation, Janie navigates these trials \nwith defiance and curiosity. Her questions and commentary \npush back in subtle, clever ways. And as the reader follows Janie’s journey\nfrom childhood to middle age, her confidence becomes infectious. Just like Hurston, Janie defies \nthe restrictive expectations for a woman in her time. Early in the novel, Hurston writes that “there are years that ask questions\nand years that answer,” suggesting that life can only truly \nbe understood by living it. But through her empathetic storytelling, Hurston invites us into Janie’s life, \nher life, and the lives of so many other women. "

        "text": "So you just strained a muscle\nand the inflammation is unbearable. You wish you had something \nice-cold to dull the pain, but to use an ice pack, you would have had\nto put it in the freezer hours ago. Fortunately, there's another option. A cold pack can be left at room temperature\nuntil the moment you need it, then just snap it as instructed\nand within seconds you'll feel the chill. But how can something go from \nroom temperature to near freezing in such a short time? The answer lies in chemistry. Your cold pack contains water\nand a solid compound, usually ammonium nitrate, in different\ncompartments separated by a barrier. When the barrier is broken,\nthe solid dissolves causing what's known as an \nendothermic reaction, one that absorbs heat from its surroundings. To understand how this works, we need to look at the two driving forces\nbehind chemical processes: energetics and entropy. These determine whether a change occurs in\na system and how energy flows if it does. In chemistry, energetics deals with\nthe attractive and repulsive forces between particles at the molecular level. This scale is so small that there are\nmore water molecules in a single glass than there are known stars in the universe. And all of these trillions \nof molecules are constantly moving, vibrating \nand rotating at different rates. We can think of temperature as\na measurement of the average motion, or kinetic energy, of all these particles, with an increase in movement\nmeaning an increase in temperature, and vice versa. The flow of heat in any \nchemical transformation depends on the relative strength\nof particle interactions in each of a substance's chemical states. When particles have a strong mutual\nattractive force, they move rapidly towards one another,\nuntil they get so close, that repulsive forces push them away. If the initial attraction was \nstrong enough, the particles will keep vibrating back\nand forth in this way. The stronger the attraction,\nthe faster their movement, and since heat is essentially motion, when a substance changes to a state\nin which these interactions are stronger, the system heats up. But our cold packs do the opposite, which means that when \nthe solid dissolves in the water, the new interactions of solid particles \nand water molecules with each other are weaker than the separate interactions\nthat existed before. This makes both types of particles \nslow down on average, cooling the whole solution. But why would a substance change to a\nstate where the interactions were weaker? Wouldn't the stronger preexisting\ninteractions keep the solid from dissolving? This is where entropy comes in. Entropy basically describes \nhow objects and energy are distributed based on random motion. If you think of the air in a room,\nthere are many different possible arrangements for the trillions of particles \nthat compose it. Some of these will have all \nthe oxygen molecules in one area, and all the nitrogen molecules in another. But far more will have them \nmixed together, which is why air is always\nfound in this state. Now, if there are strong\nattractive forces between particles, the probability of some configurations\ncan change even to the point where the odds\ndon't favor certain substances mixing. Oil and water not mixing is an example. But in the case of the ammonium nitrate,\nor other substance in your cold pack, the attractive forces are not \nstrong enough to change the odds, and random motion makes the particles\ncomposing the solid separate by dissolving into the water\nand never returning to their solid state. To put it simply, your cold pack gets \ncold because random motion creates more configurations where \nthe solid and water mix together and all of these have even weaker\nparticle interaction, less overall particle movement, and less heat than there was \ninside the unused pack. So while the disorder that can result\nfrom entropy may have caused your injury\nin the first place, its also responsible for that\ncomforting cold that soothes your pain. "

Those settlements didn't last,\nbut Columbus's did. And the news he brought back to Europe\nspread far and wide, inspiring all the explorers and settlers\nwho came after. Without him, none of us \nwould be here today.\" \"And because of him, millions of\nNative Americans aren't here today. Do you know what Columbus did\nin the colonies he founded? He took the very first \nnatives he met prisoner and wrote in his journal about how easily\nhe could conquer and enslave all of them.\" \"Oh, come on. Everyone was fighting each\nother back then. Didn't the natives even tell Columbus about other tribes raiding\nand taking captives?\" \"Yes, but tribal warfare \nwas sporadic and limited. It certainly didn't wipe out 90%\nof the population.\" \"Hmm. Why is celebrating this Columbus\nso important to you, anyway?\" \"Your Honor, Columbus's voyage \nwas an inspiration to struggling people all across Europe,\nsymbolizing freedom and new beginnings. And his discovery gave our grandparents\nand great-grandparents the chance to come here and build better\nlives for their children. Don't we deserve a hero to remind\neveryone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants?\" \"And what about the struggles \nof Native Americans who were nearly wiped out \nand forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from\npoverty and discrimination? How can you make a hero out of a man\nwho caused so much suffering?\" \"That's history. You can't judge a guy\nin the 15th century by modern standards. People back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization \nacross the world was a moral duty.\" \"Actually, he was pretty bad,\neven by old standards. While governing Hispaniola, he tortured\nand mutilated natives who didn't bring him enough gold and sold girls as young as nine into \nsexual slavery, and he was brutal even to the other \ncolonists he ruled, to the point that he was removed \nfrom power and thrown in jail. When the missionary, \nBartolomé de las Casas, visited the island, he wrote, 'From 1494 to 1508,\nover 3,000,000 people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in \nfuture generations will believe this?'\" \"Well, I'm not sure I believe \nthose numbers.\" \"Say, aren't there other ways the holiday\nis celebrated?\" \"In some Latin American countries, they celebrate the same date under\ndifferent names, such as Día de la Raza. In these places, it's more a celebration\nof the native and mixed cultures that survived through the colonial period. Some places in the U.S. have also\nrenamed the holiday, as Native American Day\nor Indigenous People's Day and changed the celebrations accordingly.\" \"So, why not just change the name\nif it's such a problem?\" \"Because it's tradition. Ordinary people need their heroes\nand their founding myths. Can't we just keep celebrating\nthe way we've been doing for a century, without having to delve into all this\nserious research? It's not like anyone is actually \ncelebrating genocide.\" \"Traditions change, and the way \nwe choose to keep them alive says a lot about our values.\" \"Well, it looks like giving tired judges a\nday off isn't one of those values, anyway.\" Traditions and holidays \nare important to all cultures, but a hero in one era\nmay become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands\nand our values evolve. And deciding what these \ntraditions should mean today is a major part \nof putting history on trial. "

        "text": "Since 2015, an unprecedented movement has\nbeen sweeping courts around the world. Groups of young plaintiffs,\nsome as young as 7, are suing their governments for their\ninaction on tackling climate change. For example, in the winter of 2018, 25 young Colombians,\nincluding Indigenous youths, sued their government for failing\nto reduce deforestation in the Amazon and falling short on climate promises. This suit, as well as others, argued that destructive\nenvironmental policies put the plaintiffs’ current and future\nlives at risk. Climate inaction violates\ntheir basic human rights— specifically the right to a healthy\nenvironment, health, food, and water. But what do human rights\nhave to do with the environment? Do you have the right\nto breathe clean air? To live in a world with white rhinos,\npolar bears, and lemur leaf frogs? What about the right to mangroves\nand coral reefs? The first international document\nto outline human rights was adopted by the newly-formed\nUnited Nations in 1948, against the backdrop of two world wars\nmarked by countless atrocities and barbaric acts. This document, known as\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or UDHR, describes the inherent freedoms\nthat belong to all people, no matter who they are or where they live,\nand which can't be granted or revoked. It establishes rights\nlike freedom of thought, political liberties\nlike the right to a fair trial, and socioeconomic and cultural rights, like the right to adequate housing\nand healthcare. While the UDHR itself is non-binding, its formation gave people an\ninternationally recognized set of ethics and standards, and laid the foundation\nfor human rights law. And since 1948, these liberties have been\nwoven into international treaties, constitutions, and laws, meaning that countries have opted\nto uphold and protect them. As a result, countless individual\nhuman rights struggles and movements have been granted legitimacy\nand a legal basis for pursuing justice. The UDHR makes no mention\nof nature, biodiversity, or climate. These rights, instead, first took hold\nat the national level. Many countries within the Global South, often influenced by Indigenous laws\nand worldviews, incorporated the right to a healthy\nenvironment into their constitutions and regional treaties. Soon, human rights advocates were calling\non the rest of the world and the United Nations to recognize\nthis right as well. Many argued that the very principles\nof the UDHR depend on access to healthy ecosystems. Each year, millions of people die\nfrom air and water pollution. Declining pollinator populations\nthreaten basic food security. And the loss of coastal habitats has left\nmillions exposed to greater risks from destructive floods and hurricanes. Protecting this right is more urgent\nnow than ever before. Climate change is causing\nmore frequent heatwaves, longer droughts, and more destructive wildfires. Without rapid and significant change,\nthe planet is at risk of mass extinction, which could wipe out a quarter\nof the world’s biodiversity by 2100. Such losses to natural ecosystems would\nlikely have disastrous knockoff effects, further threatening food supplies,\ndestroying livelihoods, and leaving humanity\nmore vulnerable to disease. Thankfully, momentum is building. Today, over 150 countries\nand jurisdictions have enshrined the right to a healthy\nenvironment into national legislation. On April 5th, 2018, the Colombian Supreme Court\nruled in favor of the young plaintiffs, finding that the government was\nlegally obliged to reduce deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions in order to protect the rights\nof present and future generations. This case and similar historic wins\nby young people in the courts of the Netherlands,\nGermany, and the US has inspired others to take up the cause. As of the summer of 2023, a wave of more than 2,000\nhuman rights-based environmental cases have been filed across the globe. And this number is likely to grow. In 2022, an overwhelming majority of\nUN General Assembly states came together to keep human rights aligned\nto a changing world by recognizing the right to a clean,\nhealthy, and sustainable environment. It will take unprecedented\nglobal cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\nstop deforestation, and keep our waterways clean. These court cases are a powerful first\nstep to hold governments accountable and to give future generations\na better chance to breathe clean air, and live in a world with white rhinos,\npolar bears, and coral reefs for years to come.

        "text": "On August 28th, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered \nhis “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington for \nJobs and Freedom. That day, nearly a quarter million people gathered on the national mall to demand an end to the discrimination,\nsegregation, violence, and economic exclusion \nblack people still faced across the United States. None of it would have been possible \nwithout the march’s chief organizer – a man named Bayard Rustin. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting\nracial segregation in high school. He remained committed to \npacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious \nobjector to World War II. During his two-year imprisonment, he protested the segregated \nfacilities from within. Wherever Rustin went, he organized and advocated,  and was constantly attuned to the \nmethods, groups, and people who could help further \nmessages of equality. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights \nwere one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the \nparty’s authoritarian leanings and left. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the \npeaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated \nMahatma Gandhi. He returned to the United States armed with strategies \nfor peaceful protest, including civil disobedience. He began to work with \nMartin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor, as well as a key strategist in the \nbroader civil rights movement. He brought his organizing expertise  to the 1956 bus boycotts \nin Montgomery, Alabama —in fact, he had organized and participated \nin a transportation protest that helped inspire the boycotts \nalmost a decade before. His largest-scale organizing project \ncame in 1963, when he led the planning for the \nnational march on Washington. The possibility of riots that could \ninjure marchers and undermine their message of peaceful \nprotest was a huge concern. Rustin not only worked with the DC \npolice and hospitals to prepare, but organized and trained a volunteer \nforce of 2,000 security marshals. In spite of his deft management, some of the other organizers did \nnot want Rustin to march in front with other leaders from the south, \nbecause of his homosexuality. Despite these slights, Rustin maintained his focus,\nand on the day of the march he delivered the\nmarchers' demands in a speech directed at \nPresident John F. Kennedy. The march itself proceeded smoothly,\nwithout any violence. It has been credited with helping pass \nthe 1964 Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation in public places \nand banned employment discrimination, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discriminatory \nvoting practices. In spite of his decades of service, Rustin’s positions on certain political \nissues were unpopular among his peers. Some thought he wasn’t critical enough \nof the Vietnam War, or that he was too eager to collaborate\nwith the political establishment including the president and congress. Others were uncomfortable with his \nformer communist affiliation. But ultimately, both his belief\nin collaboration with the government \nand his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire\nto maximize tangible gains in liberties for black Americans, and to do so as quickly as possible. Rustin was passed over for several \ninfluential roles in the 1960s and 70s, but he never stopped his activism. In the 1980s, he publicly came out as gay,\nand was instrumental in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis\nuntil his death in 1987. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously \nawarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, praising Rustin’s \n“march towards true equality, no matter who we are \nor who we love.” "

        "text": "What if you could only see one color? Imagine, for instance, that you could only see things that were red and that everything else was completely invisible to you. As it turns out, that's how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light. Different kinds of light are all around you everyday but are invisible to the human eye, from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs, to the x-rays doctors use to see inside of you, to the microwaves that heat up your food. In order to understand how these can all be light, we'll need to know a thing or two about what light is. Light is electromagnetic radiation that acts like both a wave and a particle. Light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean. There are big waves and small waves, waves that crash on the shore one right after the other, and waves that only roll in every so often. The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by is called its frequency. Imagine being a boat in that ocean, bobbing up and down as the waves go by. If the waves that day have long wavelengths, they'll make you bob only so often, or at a low frequency. If the waves, instead, have short wavelengths, they'll be close together, and you'll bob up and down much more often, at a high frequency. Different kinds of light are all waves, they just have different wavelengths and frequencies. If you know the wavelength or frequency of a wave of light, you can also figure out its energy. Long wavelengths have low energies, while short wavelengths have high energies. It's easy to remember if you think about being in that boat. If you were out sailing on a day with short, choppy waves, you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself, running around to keep things from falling over. But on a long wavelength sea, you'd be rolling along, relaxed, low energy. The energy of light tells us how it will interact with matter, for example, the cells of our eyes. When we see, it's because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eye called the retina. Our retina are only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, and so we call that range of light visible light. Inside our retina are special receptors called rods and cones. The rods measure brightness, so we know how much light there is. The cones are in charge of what color of light we see because different cones are sensitive to different energies of light. Some cones are more excited by light that is long wavelength and low energy, and other cones are more excited by short wavelength, high-energy light. When light hits our eye, the relative amount of energy each cone measures signals our brain to perceive colors. The rainbow we perceive is actually visible light in order of its energy. At one side of the rainbow is low-energy light we see as red, and at the other side is high-energy light we see as blue. If light shines on us that has an energy our retina can't measure, we won't be able to see it. Light that is too short wavelength or high energy gets absorbed by the eye's surface before it can even get to the retina, and light that is too long wavelength doesn't have enough energy to stimulate our retina at all. The only thing that makes one kind of light different from another is its wavelength. Radio waves have long wavelengths, while x-rays have short wavelengths. And visible light, the kind you can actually see, is somewhere in between. Even though our eyes can't detect light outside of the visible range, we can build special detectors that are stimulated by these other wavelengths of light, kind of like digital eyes. With these devices, we can measure the light that is there, even though we can't see it ourselves. So, take a step back and think about all of this for a moment. Even though they seem different, the warmth you feel from a crackling fire is the same as the sun shining on you on a beautiful day, the same as ultraviolet light you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from, the same thing as your TV, your radio, and your microwave. Now, those examples are all things here on Earth, things you experience in your everyday life, but here's something even more amazing. Our universe gives off the full spectrum of light, too. When you think of the night sky, you probably think of being able to see the stars shining with your own eyes, but that's just visible light, which you now know is only a tiny part of the full spectrum. If we had to draw the universe and could only use visible light, it would be like having only one crayon -- pretty sad. To see the universe in its full spectrum, we need to have the right eyes, and that means using special telescopes that can help us see beyond visible light. You've probably heard of the Hubble Space Telescope and seen its beautiful pictures taken in visible and ultraviolet light. But you might not know that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit, missions that can each see part of the full spectrum of light. With telescopes acting as our virtual eyes, both in space and here on Earth, we can see some amazing things. And the coolest thing of all, no matter the wavelength or energy, the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth. So, since we know the physics of how x-ray, ultraviolet light, or microwaves work here, we can study the light of a distant star or galaxy and know what kinds of things are happening there too. So, as you go about your daily life, think beyond what your eyes can and can't see. Knowing just a little bit about the natural world can help you perceive the full spectrum around you all the time.

        "text": "Transcriber: TED Translators Admin\nReviewer: Mirjana Čutura About 10,000 years ago,\nhumans began to farm. This agricultural revolution\nwas a turning point in our history that enabled people to settle,\nbuild and create. In short, agriculture\nenabled the existence of civilization. Today, approximately 40 percent\nof our planet is farmland. Spread all over the world, these agricultural lands\nare the pieces to a global puzzle we are all facing: in the future, how can we feed\nevery member of a growing population a healthy diet? Meeting this goal will require nothing short of a second\nagricultural revolution. The first agricultural revolution was characterized\nby expansion and exploitation, feeding people at the expense\nof forests, wildlife and water and destabilizing the climate\nin the process. That's not an option the next time around. Agriculture depends on a stable climate with predictable seasons\nand weather patterns. This means we can't keep\nexpanding our agricultural lands, because doing so will undermine\nthe environmental conditions that make agriculture possible\nin the first place. Instead, the next agricultural revolution will have to increase the output\nof our existing farmland for the long term while protecting biodiversity,\nconserving water and reducing pollution\nand greenhouse gas emissions. So what will the future farms look like? This drone is part of a fleet\nthat monitors the crops below. The farm may look haphazard but is a delicately engineered\nuse of the land that intertwines crops and livestock\nwith wild habitats. Conventional farming methods\ncleared large swathes of land and planted them with a single crop, eradicating wildlife and emitting huge amounts\nof greenhouse gases in the process. This approach aims to correct that damage. Meanwhile, moving among the crops, teams of field robots\napply fertilizer in targeted doses. Inside the soil, hundreds of sensors gather data\non nutrients and water levels. This information reduces\nunnecessary water use and tells farmers where they should apply\nmore and less fertilizer instead of causing pollution\nby showering it across the whole farm. But the farms of the future\nwon't be all sensors and robots. These technologies are designed\nto help us produce food in a way that works with the environment rather than against it, taking into account\nthe nuances of local ecosystems. Lower-cost agricultural practices\ncan also serve those same goals and are much more accessible\nto many farmers. In fact, many such practices\nare already in use today and stand to have\nan increasingly large impact as more farmers adopt them. In Costa Rica, farmers have intertwined farmland\nwith tropical habitat so successfully that they have significantly contributed\nto doubling the country's forest cover. This provides food\nand habitat for wildlife as well as natural pollination\nand pest control from the birds and insects\nthese farms attract, producing food while restoring the planet. In the United States, ranchers are raising cattle\non grasslands composed of native species, generating a valuable protein source using production methods that store carbon\nand protect biodiversity. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, new approaches to rice production may dramatically decrease\ngreenhouse gas emissions in the future. Rice is a staple food\nfor three billion people and the main source of livelihood\nfor millions of households. More than 90 percent of rice\nis grown in flooded paddies, which use a lot of water and release 11 percent\nof annual methane emissions, which accounts for one to two percent of total annual greenhouse gas\nemissions globally. By experimenting with new strains of rice, irrigating less and adopting less labor-intensive\nways of planting seeds, farmers in these countries have already increased\ntheir incomes and crop yields while cutting down\non greenhouse gas emissions. In Zambia, numerous organizations\nare investing in locally specific methods to improve crop production,\nreduce forest loss and improve livelihoods for local farmers. These efforts are projected\nto increase crop yield by almost a quarter\nover the next few decades. If combined with methods\nto combat deforestation in the region, they could move the country toward a resilient, climate-focused\nagricultural sector. And in India, where up to 40 percent\nof post-harvest food is lost or wasted due to poor infrastructure, farmers have already started to implement\nsolar-powered cold storage capsules that help thousands of rural farmers\npreserve their produce and become a viable part\nof the supply chain. It will take all of these methods, from the most high-tech\nto the lowest-cost, to revolutionize farming. High-tech interventions stand to amplify climate- and conservation-oriented\napproaches to farming, and large producers will need to invest\nin implementing these technologies. Meanwhile, we'll have to expand access\nto the lower-cost methods for smaller-scale farmers. This vision of future farming\nwill also require a global shift toward more plant-based diets and huge reductions\nin food loss and waste, both of which will reduce\npressure on the land and allow farmers to do more\nwith what they have available. If we optimize food production,\nboth on land and sea, we can feed humanity within the environmental\nlimits of the earth, but there's a very small margin of error, and it will take unprecedented\nglobal cooperation and coordination of the agricultural\nlands we have today.

        "text": "Mohammadpur has always had \na unique relationship with the weather. Located at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, this coastal village was built \non top of the Meghna River delta. Deltas are a kind of landmass formed \nwhen sediment carried by rivers is deposited where that river meets \na larger body of water. River deltas are incredibly fertile\necosystems capable of supporting abundant agriculture\nand marine life. However, their borders gradually change\nas rivers bring more sediment in and storms wash sediment away. The residents of Mohammadpur are well\naccustomed to managing the ebbs and flows of this ever-shifting\nlandscape. But lately, an abundance of intense\ncyclones have caused frequent flooding that impedes farming and fishing. These floods also erode the coastline, allowing later storms to wipe\naway land altogether. Since 2000, the Meghna River has overtaken\nthe coastline by 2.5 kilometers, forcing many villagers to move inland\nor to nearby cities. Mohammadpur isn’t the only place \nwhere erratic weather is impacting people’s mobility. Repeated typhoons in the Philippines have \ndisplaced thousands from their homes. In Fiji, the government is already moving\nmany coastal villages inland to get ahead of predicted land loss. And in the United States, melting permafrost is causing chunks\nof the Alaskan coastline to erode. In some ways, this is nothing new. Humanity has always adapted\nto changing weather and moved to regions that best support\ncultural lifestyles and livelihoods. However, scientists agree \nthat this rise in extreme weather is a by-product of Earth’s \nrapidly changing climate. Global warming increases the frequency and\nintensity of storms, flooding and drought, while also melting polar ice caps \nand raising sea levels. These factors are changing the environment\nmuch faster than they have in the past. Even for communities with the resources \nto take action, the variable pace and nature of these\nchanges makes them difficult to adapt to. And the vulnerable populations most\nimpacted by climate change are often those least responsible. Many facing climate mobility live \nin farming and fishing communities in countries that generate dramatically \nfewer emissions than their larger counterparts. Bangladesh is one such country. The nation has a unique combination\nof low-lying geography and heavily populated coastal regions. Most of these vulnerable coastal families,\nlike those in Mohammadpur, don’t want to abandon \ntheir homes and livelihoods. And for others, leaving Bangladesh\nisn’t financially practical. So to stay with their communities, many have moved a few meters inland and built more resilient homes\non higher ground or elevated stilts. Others have tried to buy land on newly\nemerging islands in the delta, while some have sent family members\nto find work in nearby cities. A handful of individuals might even cross\ninternational borders, if they have family, friends, or work \nconnections on the other side. But many of the residents who’ve left\nare eager to return home. Unfortunately, it's unclear when\nweather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed\nprojects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion. In other parts of the world, people couldn’t move inland \neven if they wanted to. The low-lying Pacific Island nations \nof Kiribati and Tuvalu are only 811 square kilometers\nand 26 square kilometers, respectively; so migration would mean moving \nto a different country altogether. Instead, their governments and citizens\nhave united in physically, legally, and politically \nfortifying their countries. Island residents are planting\ncoastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land\nwith dredged sand to shield themselves against storms \nand rising sea levels. And the islands’ governments have\nrepeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions \nto reduce pollution and take responsibility \nfor climate change. The challenges facing\neach coastal community are unique, and the diversity of the people's\nexperiences can make climate mobility a difficult phenomenon \nto measure and define. But as new communities are endangered\nby extreme weather, it’s more important than ever\nto listen to those on the front lines of this crisis. "

        "text": "The victory of the underdog over\nthe favored team. The last minute penalty shot\nthat wins the tournament. The high-energy training montages. Many people love to glorify victory\non the playing field, cheer for favorite teams, and play sports. But here's a question:\nShould we be so obsessed with sports? Is playing sports actually as good for us\nas we make it out to be, or just a fun and entertaining pastime? What does science have to say? First of all, it's well accepted that\nexercise is good for our bodies and minds, and that's definitely true. Exercising, especially when we're young,\nhas all sorts of health benefits, like strengthening our bones, clearing out bad cholesterol\nfrom our arteries, and decreasing the risk of stroke,\nhigh blood pressure, and diabetes. Our brains also release a number\nof chemicals when we workout, including endorphins. These natural hormones, which control pain and pleasure responses\nin the cental nervous system, can lead to feelings of euphoria,\nor, what's often called, a runner's high. Increased endorphins and consistent\nphysical activity in general can sharpen your focus\nand improve your mood and memory. So does that mean we get just as much\nbenefit going to the gym five days a week as we would joining a team and competing? Well, here's where it gets interesting: because it turns out that if you can find\na sport and a team you like, studies show that there are all sorts\nof benefits that go beyond the physical\nand mental benefits of exercise alone. Some of the most significant\nare psychological benefits, both in the short and long term. Some of those come from the communal\nexperience of being on a team, for instance, learning to trust\nand depend on others, to accept help, to give help, and to work together towards\na common goal. In addition, commitment to a team\nand doing something fun can also make it easier to establish\na regular habit of exercise. School sport participation \nhas also been shown to reduce the risk of suffering\nfrom depression for up to four years. Meanwhile, your self-esteem and confidence\ncan get a big boost. There are a few reasons for that. One is found in training. Just by working and working at skills, especially with a good coach, you reinforce a growth mindset \nwithin yourself. That's when you say, \"Even if I can't\ndo something today, I can improve myself through practice\nand achieve it eventually.\" That mindset is useful \nin all walks of life. And then there's learning through failure, one of the most transformative,\nlong-term benefits of playing sports. The experience of coming to terms\nwith defeat can build the resilience and self-awareness necessary \nto manage academic, social, and physical hurdles. So even if your team isn't winning\nall the time, or at all, there's a real benefit to your experience. Now, not everyone will enjoy every sport. Perhaps one team is too competitive, or not competitive enough. It can also take time to find\na sport that plays to your strengths. That's completely okay. But if you spend some time looking, you'll be able to find a sport\nthat fits your individual needs, and if you do, there are so many benefits. You'll be a part of \na supportive community, you'll be building your confidence, you'll be exercising your body, and you'll be nurturing your mind, not to mention having fun. "

        "text": "Thousands of years ago,\nthe Romans invented a material that allowed them to build \nmuch of their sprawling civilization. Pliny the Elder praised an imposing\nsea wall made from the stuff as “impregnable to the waves\nand every day stronger.” He was right: much of this construction\nstill stands, having survived millennia of battering \nby environmental forces that would topple modern buildings. Today, our roads, sidewalks, bridges, \nand skyscrapers are made of a similar, though \nless durable, material called concrete. There’s three tons of it for every person \non Earth. And over the next 40 years, \nwe’ll use enough of it to build the equivalent of New York City \nevery single month. Concrete has shaped our skylines, but that's not the only way\nit's changed our world. It’s also played a surprisingly large role\nin rising global temperatures over the last century, a trend that has already \nchanged the world, and threatens to even more drastically\nin the coming decades. To be fair to concrete, basically\neverything humanity does contributes to the greenhouse gas \nemissions that cause global warming. Most of those emissions come \nfrom industrial processes we often aren’t aware of, \nbut touch every aspect of our lives. Look around your home. Refrigeration— \nalong with other heating and cooling— makes up about 6% of total emissions. Agriculture, which produces our food,\naccounts for 18%. Electricity is responsible for 27%. Walk outside, and the cars zipping past,\nplanes overhead, trains ferrying commuters to work— transportation, including shipping, contributes 16% \nof greenhouse gas emissions. Even before we use any of these things,\nmaking them produces emissions— a lot of emissions. Making materials— concrete, steel, plastic, glass, \naluminum and everything else— accounts for 31%\nof greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete alone is responsible for 8% \nof all carbon emissions worldwide. And it’s much more difficult to reduce \nthe emissions from concrete than from other building materials. The problem is cement, \none of the four ingredients in concrete. It holds the other three ingredients—\ngravel, sand, and water— together. Unfortunately, it's impossible to make\ncement without generating carbon dioxide. The essential ingredient in cement\nis calcium oxide, CaO. We get that calcium oxide from limestone, which is mostly made of calcium carbonate:\nCaCO3. We extract CaO from CaCO3\nby heating limestone. What’s left is CO2— carbon dioxide. So for every ton of cement we produce,\nwe release one ton of carbon dioxide. As tricky as this problem is, it means concrete could help\nus change the world a third time: by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions\nand stabilizing our climate. Right now, there’s no 100% clean concrete, but there are some great ideas\nto help us get there. Cement manufacturing also produces\ngreenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels \nto heat the limestone. Heating the limestone with clean \nelectricity or alternative fuels instead would eliminate those emissions. For the carbon dioxide from\nthe limestone itself, our best bet is carbon capture: specifically, capturing the carbon\nright where it’s produced, before it enters the atmosphere. Devices that do this already exist, but they aren’t widely used because\nthere’s no economic incentive. Transporting and then storing \nthe captured carbon can be expensive. To solve these problems, one company has found a way to store\ncaptured CO2 permanently in the concrete itself. Other innovators are tinkering with \nthe fundamental chemistry of concrete. Some are investigating ways \nto reduce emissions by decreasing the cement in concrete. Still others have been working\nto uncover and replicate the secrets of Roman concrete. They found that Pliny’s remark \nis literally true. The Romans used volcanic ash \nin their cement. When the ash interacted with seawater,\nthe seawater strengthened it— making their concrete stronger and more \nlong-lasting than any we use today. By adding these findings to an arsenal \nof modern innovations, hopefully we can replicate their success— both by making long lasting structures, and ensuring our descendants can admire\nthem thousands of years from now.

In that single intake of air, your lungs swelled with roughly\n25 sextillion molecules, ranging from compounds produced days ago, to those formed billions of years \nin the past. In fact, many of the molecules \nyou’re breathing were likely exhaled by members \nof ancient civilizations and innumerable humans since. But what exactly are we all breathing? Roughly 78% of Earth’s atmosphere\nis composed of nitrogen generated by volcanic activity \ndeep beneath the planet’s crust. The next major ingredient is oxygen,\naccounting for 21% of Earth’s air. While oxygen molecules have been around\nas long as Earth’s oceans, oxygen gas didn’t appear until \nocean dwelling microorganisms evolved to produce it. Finally, .93% of our air is argon, a molecule formed from the radioactive\ndecay of potassium in Earth’s atmosphere, crust, and core. Together, all these dry gases \nmake up 99.93% of each breath you take. Depending on when and where you are,\nthe air may also contain some water vapor. But even more variable \nis that remaining .07%, which contains a world of possibilities. This small slice of air is composed\nof numerous small particles including pollen, fungal spores, \nand liquid droplets, alongside trace gases\nlike methane and carbon dioxide. The specific cocktail of natural \nand man-made compounds changes dramatically from place to place. But no matter where you are, .07% of every breath you take \nlikely contains man-made pollutants— potentially including toxic compounds \nthat can cause lung disease, cancer, and even DNA damage. There’s a wide variety of known pollutants\nbut they all fall into two categories. The first are primary pollutants. These toxic compounds are directly emitted from a man-made \nor naturally occurring source. However, they don't always come\nfrom the places you'd expect. Some large factories mostly generate \nwater vapor, with only small quantities of pollutants \nmixed in. Conversely, burning wood or dung can \ncreate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; dangerous compounds that have been \nlinked to several types of cancer, as well as long-term DNA damage. In all cases, pollutants interact with\nregional weather patterns and topography, which can keep compounds local \nor spread them kilometers away. When these molecules travel \nthrough the air, a transformation occurs. Natural compounds called oxidants,\nformed by oxygen and sunlight, break down the pollutants. Sometimes, these reactions make pollutants\nmore easily washed out by rain. But in other cases, they result \nin even more toxic secondary pollutants. For example, when factories burn coal, they release high concentrations\nof sulfur oxides. These molecules oxidize to form sulfates, which condense with water vapor in the air\nto form a blanket of fine particles that impair visibility \nand cause severe lung damage. This so-called sulfurous smog was \nwell-known in 20th century London and continues to plague cities \nlike Beijing. Since the advent of cars, another secondary pollutant \nhas taken center stage. Exhaust from fossil fuel-burning vehicles\nreleases nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons which react to form ozone. And while some ozone \nin the upper atmosphere helps shield us from ultraviolet rays,\non the ground, this gas can form alongside secondary\nparticles and create photochemical smog. This brown fog can be found covering\ndensely packed cities, making seeing difficult \nand breathing hazardous. It also contributes to climate change\nby trapping heat in the atmosphere. In recent decades, industrial activity\nhas contributed to a huge spike in various trace gas emissions, fundamentally changing the air \nwe all breathe. Many places have already responded\nwith countermeasures. Most cars produced since the 1980′s \nare equipped with catalytic converters that reduce the emission \nof carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. And today, places like Beijing are\nbattling smog by electrifying \ntheir energy infrastructure and limiting automobile emissions \naltogether. But while moving away from fossil fuels \nis essential, there's no universal remedy\nfor air pollution. Different regions need to respond \nwith unique regulations that account for their local pollutants. Because no matter where you live, \nwe all share the same air. "

        "text": "So you're stranded in a huge rainforest,\nand you've eaten a poisonous mushroom. To save your life, you need the antidote\nexcreted by a certain species of frog. Unfortunately, only the female \nof the species produces the antidote, and to make matters worse, the male and female occur in equal\nnumbers and look identical, with no way for you to tell them apart, except that the male \nhas a distinctive croak. And it may just be your lucky day. To your left, you've spotted a frog\non a tree stump, but before you start running to it, you're startled by the croak\nof a male frog coming from a clearing \nin the opposite direction. There, you see two frogs, but you can't tell which one \nmade the sound. You feel yourself starting \nto lose consciousness, and realize you only have time to go\nin one direction before you collapse. What are your chances of survival\nif you head for the clearing and lick both of the frogs there? What about if you go to the tree stump? Which way should you go? Press pause now\nto calculate odds yourself. 3 2 1 If you chose to go to the clearing,\nyou're right, but the hard part is correctly \ncalculating your odds. There are two common incorrect ways\nof solving this problem. Wrong answer number one: Assuming there's a roughly equal\nnumber of males and females, the probability of any one frog being\neither sex is one in two, which is 0.5, or 50%. And since all frogs are independent\nof each other, the chance of any one of them being female\nshould still be 50% each time you choose. This logic actually is correct \nfor the tree stump, but not for the clearing. Wrong answer two: First, you saw two frogs in the clearing. Now you've learned that at least\none of them is male, but what are the chances that both are? If the probability of each individual frog\nbeing male is 0.5, then multiplying the two together\nwill give you 0.25, which is one in four, or 25%. So, you have a 75% chance \nof getting at least one female and receiving the antidote. So here's the right answer. Going for the clearing gives you\na two in three chance of survival, or about 67%. If you're wondering how this \ncould possibly be right, it's because of something called\nconditional probability. Let's see how it unfolds. When we first see the two frogs, there are several possible combinations\nof male and female. If we write out the full list, we have what mathematicians call\nthe sample space, and as we can see, out of the four possible combinations,\nonly one has two males. So why was the answer of 75% wrong? Because the croak gives \nus additional information. As soon as we know \nthat one of the frogs is male, that tells us there can't be \na pair of females, which means we can eliminate\nthat possibility from the sample space, leaving us with \nthree possible combinations. Of them, one still has two males, giving us our two in three,\nor 67% chance of getting a female. This is how conditional probability works. You start off with a large sample space\nthat includes every possibility. But every additional piece of information\nallows you to eliminate possibilities, shrinking the sample space and increasing the probability \nof getting a particular combination. The point is that information\naffects probability. And conditional probability isn't just\nthe stuff of abstract mathematical games. It pops up in the real world, as well. Computers and other devices use\nconditional probability to detect likely errors in the strings\nof 1's and 0's that all our data consists of. And in many of our own life decisions, we use information gained from \npast experience and our surroundings to narrow down our choices\nto the best options so that maybe next time, we can avoid eating that poisonous \nmushroom in the first place.

In June of 1776, a little more than a year after the war against England began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord, the Continental Congress was meeting in Philadelphia to discuss American independence. After long debates, a resolution of independence was approved on July 2, 1776. America was free! And men like John Adams thought we would celebrate that date forever. But it was two days later that the gentlemen in Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, largely written by Thomas Jefferson, offering all the reasons why the country should be free. More than 235 years later, we celebrate that day as America's birthday. But there are some pieces of the story you may not know. First of all, Thomas Jefferson gets the credit for writing the Declaration, but five men had been given the job to come up with a document explaining why America should be independent: Robert Livingston, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams were all named first. And it was Adams who suggested that the young, and little known, Thomas Jefferson join them because they needed a man from the influential Virginia Delegation, and Adams thought Jefferson was a much better writer than he was. Second, though Jefferson never used footnotes, or credited his sources, some of his memorable words and phrases were borrowed from other writers and slightly tweaked. Then, Franklin and Adams offered a few suggestions. But the most important change came after the Declaration was turned over to the full Congress. For two days, a very unhappy Thomas Jefferson sat and fumed while his words were picked over. In the end, the Congress made a few, minor word changes, and one big deletion. In the long list of charges that Jefferson made against the King of England, the author of the Declaration had included the idea that George the Third was responsible for the slave trade, and was preventing America from ending slavery. That was not only untrue, but Congress wanted no mention of slavery in the nation's founding document. The reference was cut out before the Declaration was approved and sent to the printer. But it leaves open the hard question: How could the men, who were about to sign a document, celebrating liberty and equality, accept a system in which some people owned others? It is a question that would eventually bring the nation to civil war and one we can still ask today. "

        "text": "On the night of January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, \na priest in Palermo, Italy, was mapping the stars in the sky. Over three nights, he'd look at and draw\nthe same set of stars, carefully measuring \ntheir relative positions. That night, he measured the stars. The next night, he measured them again. To his surprise, one had moved. The third night, the peculiar star\nhad moved again. This meant it couldn't be a star at all. It was something new, the first asteroid\never discovered, which Piazzi eventually named Ceres. Asteroids are bits of rock and metal\nthat orbit the Sun. At over 900 kilometers across,\nCeres is a very large asteroid. But through a telescope, like Piazzi's, Ceres looked like a pinpoint of light\nsimilar to a star. In fact, the word asteroid \nmeans star-like. You can tell the difference between stars and asteroids by \nthe way they move across the sky. Of course, Piazzi knew \nnone of that at the time, just that he had discovered something new. To learn about Ceres, Piazzi needed to track \nits motion across the sky and then calculate \nits orbit around the Sun. So each clear night, Piazzi\ntrained his telescope to the heavens. Night after night, \nhe made careful measurements until finally, he couldn't. The Sun got in the way. When Piazzi first spotted Ceres,\nit was here, and the Earth was here. As he tracked it each night,\nthe Earth and Ceres moved like this until Ceres was here. And that meant that Ceres was only\nin the sky when it was daytime on Earth. During the day, bright sunlight made \nthis small asteroid impossible to see. Astronomers needed to calculate\nCeres's orbit. This would let them predict where\nit was going to be in the vast night sky on any given night. But the calculations were grueling\nand the results imprecise. Many astronomers searched for Ceres, but not knowing exactly where to look,\nno one could find it. Luckily, a hardworking mathematician\nnamed Carl Friedrich Gauss heard about the lost asteroid. He thought it was an exciting puzzle\nand went to work. When he realized he didn't have\nthe mathematical methods he needed, he invented new ones \nthat we still use today. He derived a new orbit and new predictions\nof where to look for Ceres. Hungarian astronomer\nBaron Franz Xaver von Zach searched for Ceres \nwith Gauss's predictions. After weeks of frustrating clouds, von Zach finally had clear skies\non December 31, 1801. He looked through his telescope\nand finally saw Ceres. We haven't lost track of it since. Today, we've discovered hundreds\nof thousands of asteroids. Many, including Ceres, orbit the Sun\nbetween Mars and Jupiter, while near-Earth asteroids orbit\nthe Sun relatively close to Earth. When we recorded this narration, astronomers had discovered \n16,407 near-Earth asteroids, but since we find \nnew asteroids all the time, that number will have grown\nby hundreds or thousands by the time you watch this. Today, asteroid hunters \nuse modern telescopes, including one in space. Computers analyze the images, and humans check the output before reporting the asteroid observations\nto an archiving center. Each discovered asteroid has its unique\norbit measured. An orbit lets astronomers predict \nwhere asteroids are going to be at any given time. Most asteroid trajectories can be\npredicted for about 80 years though we can calculate where the best\nstudied asteroids will be every day between now and \n800 years into the future. We must keep searching for asteroids in case there's one out there\non a collision course with Earth. Astronomers don't only \nsearch for asteroids, though. They also study them \nto learn how they formed, what they're made of, and what they can tell us \nabout our solar system. Today, we can do something that Piazzi\ncould only dream of: send spacecraft to study \nasteroids up close. One spacecraft called Dawn\njourneyed billions of kilometers over four years to the main asteroid belt. There, it visited Ceres\nand another asteroid, Vesta. Dawn's stunning images transformed\nPiazzi's dot of light into a spectacular landscape\nof craters, landslides, and mountains. "

        "text": "How is it that a breathalyzer can measure \nthe alcohol content in someone’s blood, hours after they had their last drink, \nbased on their breath alone? Exhaled breath contains trace amounts \nof hundreds, even thousands, of volatile organic compounds: small molecules lightweight enough \nto travel easily as gases. One of these is ethanol, \nwhich we consume in alcoholic drinks. It travels through the bloodstream \nto tiny air sacs in the lungs, passing into exhaled air \nat a concentration 2,000 times lower, on average, than in the blood. When someone breathes \ninto a breathalyzer, the ethanol in their breath \npasses into a reaction chamber. There, it’s converted to another molecule,\ncalled acetic acid, in a special type of reactor that produces\nan electric current during the reaction. The strength of the current \nindicates the amount of ethanol in the sample of air, \nand by extension in the blood. In addition to the volatile \norganic compounds like ethanol we consume in food and drink, the biochemical processes of our cells \nproduce many others. And when something disrupts \nthose processes, like a disease, the collection of volatile \norganic compounds in the breath may change, too. So could we detect disease \nby analyzing a person’s breath, without using more invasive \ndiagnostic tools like biopsies, blood draws, and radiation? In theory, yes, but testing for disease is a lot more \ncomplicated than testing for alcohol. To identify diseases, researchers need to look at a set \nof tens of compounds in the breath. A given disease may cause \nsome of these compounds to increase or decrease in concentration, \nwhile others may not change— the profile is likely to be different \nfor every disease, and could even vary for different stages \nof the same disease. For example, cancers are among \nthe most researched candidates for diagnosis through breath analysis. One of the biochemical changes \nmany tumors cause is a large increase \nin an energy-generating process called glycolysis. Known as the Warburg Effect, this increase in glycolysis results \nin an increase of metabolites like lactate which in turn can affect a whole cascade \nof metabolic processes and ultimately result \nin altered breath composition, possibly including an increased \nconcentration of volatile compounds such as dimethyl sulfide. But the Warburg Effect is just one \npotential indicator of cancerous activity, and doesn’t reveal anything \nabout the particular type of cancer. Many more indicators are needed \nto make a diagnosis. To find these subtle differences, researchers compare the breath \nof healthy people with the breath of people \nwho suffer from a particular disease using profiles based on hundreds \nof breath samples. This complex analysis \nrequires a fundamentally different, more versatile type of sensor \nfrom the alcohol breathalyzer. There are a few being developed. Some discriminate \nbetween individual compounds by observing how the compounds move \nthrough a set of electric fields. Others use an array of resistors \nmade of different materials that each change their resistance \nwhen exposed to a certain mix of volatile organic compounds. There are other challenges too. These substances are present \nat incredibly low concentrations— typically just parts per billion, much lower than ethanol concentrations \nin the breath. Compounds’ levels may be affected \nby factors other than disease, including age, gender, nutrition, \nand lifestyle. Finally, there’s the issue of distinguishing which compounds \nin the sample were produced in the patient’s body and which were inhaled \nfrom the environment shortly before the test. Because of these challenges, \nbreath analysis isn’t quite ready yet. But preliminary clinical trials \non lung, colon, and other cancers \nhave had encouraging results. One day, catching cancer early \nmight be as easy as breathing in and out. "

        "text": "In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, methodically scanning and sorting\nthe wavelengths reflecting off the planet’s surface. Researchers were looking for the spectral \nsignature of carbon dioxide when they noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength\nof unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth \nwith only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered \nin a red hue of varying intensity. This couldn’t have been reflected sunlight because it was a wavelength that never \nescapes the Sun’s outer atmosphere. And it didn’t correspond \nwith densely populated areas, suggesting it wasn’t human-made either. In fact, it was emanating \nfrom places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, \nnorthern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US \nwere all ablaze. So, what was going on? Plants and other organisms use light\nto grow by way of photosynthesis. But that’s just one of three\nways that light entering a photosynthetic organism \nis used. And this is the key to solving \nthe mystery. To understand the others, \nwe need to begin with photosynthesis. During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s \ncells called chloroplasts, which are packed \nwith chlorophyll pigments. When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, \nsome of their electrons become excited. They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy \ninto chemical energy. This powers the conversion of carbon \ndioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow. And of course, this reaction generates\nan important byproduct. Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried \nout by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen. But plants regularly absorb more light\nthan they’re able to consume. For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't\nphotosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed\nto a lot of sunlight. If not dealt with, the excess light can\ndamage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light\nis by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves. The third way plants interact \nwith incoming light is by radiating it back out \nat a different wavelength, producing what’s called \nchlorophyll fluorescence. During photosynthesis, \nthe chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series\nof chemical reactions. But as some of the excited electrons\nfall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light. Overall, about 1% of the light \nabsorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red\nend of the spectrum. It’s such a small amount that you\ncan’t see it with the naked eye. But plants the world over are fluorescing\nas they photosynthesize. And this is what’s caused \nthe Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite. It was an accidental discovery, \nbut a huge breakthrough. Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence \nfrom space allows us to watch the planet breathe\nin real time— and monitor the health \nof ecosystems worldwide. Previously, researchers used levels\nof greenness as the main estimate for plant health. Because plants generally change colors \nor lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically\nindicate healthier plants. But this measure can be unreliable. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence \nis a direct measure of photosynthetic activity. It can help us infer how much\noxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed \nin a given system. Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence \nmay also occur before visible signs of plant stress,\nmaking it a timely measure. Scientists have already used chlorophyll\nfluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought \nin the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating \nphotosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support \nour silent friends, who already do so much for us. "

        "text": "You've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth, but how does it work? Is it like the glass of a greenhouse or like an insulating blanket? Well, not entirely. The answer involves a bit of quantum mechanics, but don't worry, we'll start with a rainbow. If you look closely at sunlight separated through a prism, you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing. Where did they go? Before reaching our eyes, different gases absorbed those specific parts of the spectrum. For example, oxygen gas snatched up some of the dark red light, and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow. But why do these gases absorb specific colors of light? This is where we enter the quantum realm. Every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons. To shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level, a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy. No more, no less. It gets that energy from light, which comes in more energy levels than you could count. Light consists of tiny particles called photons and the amount of energy in each photon corresponds to its color. Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths. Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths. Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow, so a gas molecule can choose the photons that carry the exact amount of energy needed to shift the molecule to its next energy level. When this match is made, the photon disappers as the molecule gains its energy, and we get a small gap in our rainbow. If a photon carries too much or too little energy, the molecule has no choice but to let it fly past. This is why glass is transparent. The atoms in glass do not pair well with any of the energy levels in visible light, so the photons pass through. So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer? Where is the black line in our rainbow that explains global warming? Well, it's not there. Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly from the Sun. It absorbs light from a totally different celestial body. One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all: Earth. If you're wondering why our planet doesn't seem to be glowing, it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light. It emits infared light. The light that our eyes can see, including all of the colors of the rainbow, is just a small part of the larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. It may seem strange to think of these things as light, but there is no fundamental difference between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation. It's the same energy, but at a higher or lower level. In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define the term visible light by our own limitations. After all, infrared light is visible to snakes, and ultraviolet light is visible to birds. If our eyes were adapted to see light of 1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone would be a flashlight, and a cell phone tower would look like a huge lantern. Earth emits infrared radiation because every object with a temperature above absolute zero will emit light. This is called thermal radiation. The hotter an object gets, the higher frequency the light it emits. When you heat a piece of iron, it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light, and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius, its light will reach the visible spectrum. At first, it will look red hot. And with even more heat, it will glow white with all of the frequencies of visible light. This is how traditional light bulbs were designed to work and why they're so wasteful. 95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes. It's wasted as heat. Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules in our atmophere. Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons. They provide the right amount of energy to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level. Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs an infrared photon, it will fall back to its previous energy level, and spit a photon back out in a random direction. Some of that energy then returns to Earth's surface, causing warming. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more likely that infrared photons will land back on Earth and change our climate.

        "text": "For years, scientists have been staking\nout this remote forest in Montana for an animal that’s notoriously\ntricky to find. Camera traps haven’t offered\ndefinitive evidence, and even experts can't identify\nits tracks with certainty. But within the past decades, researchers have developed methods that\ncan detect even the most elusive species. And so, in 2018, these scientists took a\nsample from some conspicuous snow tracks. Lab tests showed conclusive results: the Canada lynx was indeed present \nin the area. Without seeing the cat, \nscientists had proof it was there because of environmental DNA or eDNA. Using a technique called \nDNA metabarcoding, researchers can take a sample\nfrom the environment and learn which organisms are in it \nor have recently passed through it. The world is covered in DNA. It’s all around us— on the ground, at the bottom of the ocean,\nand up in the clouds. Multicellular organisms are constantly\nshedding cells. But until recently, \neDNA wasn’t very useful to us. Traditional scientific techniques couldn’t\nparse environmental samples containing mixed genetic material\nfrom multiple species. But DNA metabarcoding can. DNA begins to degrade once it’s exposed\nto the environment. In the ocean, for example, \nit may only persist for a few days. So in many contexts, eDNA is useful \nfor telling us about the recent past. The process of DNA metabarcoding starts\nwith an environmental sample like a core of soil, a vial of water,\nsome feces, an insect trap, or even the blood from leeches’ stomachs. Researchers then sift out everything aside\nfrom DNA by blending the sample up and using enzymes that break down cellular\nproteins and release DNA, which they purify. The result is a “soup”\nof all the DNA in the sample. Scientists then apply the polymerase\nchain reaction or PCR, which uses artificial DNA strands\ncalled universal primers. These primers bind to DNA sequences\nthat are similar across species, then amplify genetic barcodes\nthat are species-specific. High-throughput sequencing then reads\nmillions of these DNA fragments, simultaneously. And finally, researchers compare them \nto reference databases and identify how many and which species \nare present— or if they’ve found entirely new ones. This method has led to the discovery \nof tens of thousands of species over the past decade. While metabarcoding can detect \nelusive animals like the Canada lynx, it can also help scientists \nidentify invasive species. In Yosemite, researchers used eDNA \nto track and remove invasive bullfrogs. Once no trace of these\namphibians remained, they reintroduced a threatened native\nspecies, California red-legged frogs, which had disappeared from the area\nsome 50 years prior. Likewise, DNA metabarcoding can be\nused to monitor biodiversity. For example, using traditional approaches, categorizing all of the insects in a\nhectare of rainforest can take decades. But DNA from insect traps could yield\nthese results in just a few months. One study compared insects\nfrom adjacent forest and plantation sites within China’s Yunnan province. It quickly found that not only were\nplantations less diverse, but deforestation affected\ninsect groups unequally. Grasshoppers thrived in cleared areas\nwhile specialist forest beetles declined. Using eDNA, scientists are able \nto investigate complex ecosystem interactions. Tracking thousands of insects \nas they visit flowers is impossible. Instead, researchers can study\nthe DNA left on flowers and insects to map pollination networks. Before these techniques were available, \nwe didn’t really know how much pollination was happening at night \nbecause we couldn’t observe it. Now scientists understand that moths \nare important nocturnal pollinators. eDNA can even tell stories \nof long extinct species. Cold, dry, and low oxygen conditions are \nperfect for preserving genetic material. By digging deep \ninto the Arctic permafrost, researchers found 50,000 year old DNA, which they matched \nto the nutrient-rich plants found in the stomachs of woolly mammoths. With eDNA, they also found \nthat less nutritious grasses colonized the Arctic steppe \nduring the last ice age, potentially contributing\nto the mammoth decline. As we face another period \nof climate change— this time due to human activities— understanding our planet’s rapidly\nshifting biodiversity will be crucial to protecting it. Fortunately, eDNA and metabarcoding give us the tools to document \nrapid change in real time. "

        "text": "Translator: tom carter\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar (Circus music) [Ted N' Ed's Carnival] [John Lloyd's Inventory of the Invisible] [Adapted from a TEDTalk\ngiven by John Lloyd in 2009] June Cohen: Our next speaker\nhas spent his whole career eliciting that sense of wonder. Please welcome John Lloyd. (Applause) [Hall of Mirrors] The question is, \"What is invisible?\" There's more of it\nthan you think, actually. Everything, I would say --\neverything that matters -- Except every thing, and except matter. We can see matter but we can't see what's the matter. We can see the stars and the planets\nbut we can't see what holds them apart, or what draws them together. With matter as with people,\nwe see only the skin of things, we can't see into the engine room,\nwe can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty, and the closer we look at anything,\nthe more it disappears. In fact, if you look\nreally closely at stuff, if you look at the basic\nsubstructure of matter, there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,\nand there is only energy. One of the interesting things\nabout invisibility is, the things that we can's see,\nwe also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see,\nand which we don't understand. It's the least understood\nof all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest, and nobody really\nknows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton,\nthe greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came\nto Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So, bright guy, could be wrong\non that one, I don't know. (Laughter) Consciousness. I see all your faces;\nI've no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing? Isn't it incredible that we can't read\neach other's minds, when we can touch each other,\ntaste each other, perhaps, if we get close enough,\nbut we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith,\nthis great Middle Eastern religion which some claim\nis the root of all religions, Sufi masters are\nall telepaths, so they say, but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals\nto the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists;\nthe Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness\nand artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really,\nlike the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere, we have no idea\nhow consciousness works. Not only have they not created\nartificial intelligence, they haven't yet created\nartificial stupidity. (Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible,\neternal, omnipresent, all powerful. Remind you of anyone? Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,\nnot a materialist, I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful\nnew word -- ignostic. Okay? I'm an ignostic. [God?] I refuse to be drawn on the question\non whether God exists until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see\nis the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar,\nbecause about 20 years ago when they started delving into the genome,\nthey thought it would probably contain around 100 thousand genes. Every year since,\nit's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely\nto be just over 20 thousand genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary,\nbecause rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes. Potatoes have 48 chromosomes,\ntwo more than people, and the same as a gorilla. (Laughter) You can't see these things,\nbut they are very strange. The stars by day, I always\nthink that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is,\nthe less you can see. Time. Nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. There's a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient\nfor the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future, obviously, and you can't see the past,\nexcept in your memory. One of the interesting\nthings about the past is you particularly can't see -- my son asked me this the other day, \"Dad, can you remember\nwhat I was like when I was two? And I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Why can't I?\" Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember what happened to you\nearlier than the age of two or three. Which is great news for psychoanalysts,\nbecause otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see\nis the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,\nthat cells are continually renewed. Skin flakes off, hairs grow,\nnails, that kind of stuff -- but every cell in your body\nis replaced at some point. Taste buds, every ten days or so. Livers and internal organs\ntake a bit longer. Spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years,\nnot one cell in your body remains from what was there\nseven years ago. The question is:\nwho then are we? What are we? What is this thing that we hang on? That is actually us? Atoms, can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller\nthan the wavelength of light. Gas, can't see that. Interesting, somebody\nmentioned 1600 recently. Gas was invented in 1600\nby a Dutch chemist called van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever\ninvention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word\ncalled \"blas,\" meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on, unfortunately. (Laughter) But well done, him. Light -- you can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,\nyou won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists\nwill disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see\nthe beam of light, you can only see what it hits. Electricity, can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you\nthey understand electricity, they don't. Nobody knows what it is. (Laughter) You probably think the electrons\nin an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you,\nat the speed of light, when you turn the light on, they don't. Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading\nhoney, they say. Galaxies -- hundred billion of them, estimated in the universe.\nHundred billion. How many can we see? Five. Five, out of a hundred billion\ngalaxies, with the naked eye. And one of them is quite difficult to see,\nunless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered\nradio waves, in 1887, he called them radio waves\nbecause they radiated. Somebody said to him,\n\"What's the point of these, Heinrich? What's the point of these radio waves\nthat you've found?\" And he said, \"Well, I've no idea, but I guess somebody will find\na use for them someday. The biggest thing that's invisible\nto us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said, \"We don't know one percent\nof one millionth about anything.\" And I've come to the conclusion -- because you ask this other question:\n\"What's another thing we can't see?\" The point, most of us. What's the point? The point -- what I've got it down to is there are only two questions\nreally worth asking. \"Why are we here?\", and \"What should\nwe do about it while we are?\" To help you, I've got two things to leave\nyou with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher\nthinkers of the 20th century. One a mathematician and engineer,\nand the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said, \"I don't know why we are here, but I am pretty sure it's not\nin order to enjoy ourselves.\" (Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he? (Laughter) And secondly, and lastly,\nW.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, \"We are here\non Earth to help others. What the others\nare here for, I've no idea.\" (Laughter) (Applause) (Circus music) [Get your souvenir photo here!] [Continue your journey into the unknown!] (Circus music) "

        "text": "Deep in our solar system, a new era of space exploration\nis unfolding. Beneath the thick ice of Europa, in the vapor plumes on Enceladus, and within the methane lakes of Titan, astrobiologists are on the hunt \nfor extraterrestrial life. We’ve honed in on these three moons \nbecause each is an ‘ocean world,’ an environment that contains \na liquid ocean– and liquid can support \nthe formation of life. Living organisms have to be able to grow, \nreproduce, and feed themselves, among other things. All of those functions require the \nformation of complex molecules from more basic components. Liquids such as water allow chemical \ncompounds to remain in suspension instead of sinking under \nthe force of gravity. This enables them to interact frequently\nin a 3-dimensional space and, in the right conditions, go through chemical reactions that \nlead to the formation of living matter. That alone isn’t enough; the small but complex biomolecules \nthat we’re familiar with are sensitive to temperature— too hot or cold, and they won’t mix. Liquid water has an additional advantage in that it’s relatively \ntemperature-stable, meaning it can insulate molecules against\nlarge shifts in heat. On Earth, these and other conditions in \naquatic environments may have supported the emergence \nof life billions of years ago. Tantalizingly, the same could be true\nin other parts of our solar system, like these three icy moons. Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter, is probably the most \nintriguing ocean world. Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker \nthan Mount Everest, there exists a liquid ocean as much as\n100 kilometers deep. Astrobiologists think this hidden \nocean could harbor life. Thanks to the Galileo probe, we can deduce that its \npotential salt content is similar to that of some lakes on Earth. But most of its characteristics will be a \nmystery until we can explore it further. Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that \nmight have the right conditions for life. For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of \nice that’s small enough to nestle within the surface area \nof the Gulf of Mexico. Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an\nocean deep under the ice. But Enceladus also has geysers that frequently vent water vapor and \ntiny ice grains into space. Astrobiologists are curious about whether\nthese geysers are connected to the ocean below. They hope to send a probe to test whether\nthe geysers’ plumes of vapor contain life-enabling material\nfrom that hidden sea. Although it’s the best known substance \nfor nurturing life, water isn’t necessarily the only medium\nthat can support living things. Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere containing methane and many other \norganic molecules. Its clouds condense and \nrain onto Titan’s surface, sustaining lakes and seas \nfull of liquid methane. This compound’s particular chemistry means\nit’s not as supportive a medium as water. But, paired with the high quantities \nof organic material that also rain down from the sky, these bodies of liquid methane could\npossibly support unfamiliar life forms. So what might indicate that life exists on\nthese or other worlds? If it is out there, astrobiologists \nspeculate that it would be microscopic, comparable to the bacteria \nwe have on earth. This would make it difficult to directly \nobserve from a great distance, so astrobiologists seek clues \ncalled biosignatures. Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral \ntraces left behind by living things. And finding any biosignatures will be \nchallenging for many reasons. One of the biggest concerns is to make sure we sterilize our \nprobes extremely thoroughly. Otherwise we could accidentally \ncontaminate ocean worlds with Earth’s own bacteria, which could destroy alien life. Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are just three of possibly many \nocean worlds that we could explore. We already know of several other \ncandidates in our solar system, including Jupiter’s moons Callisto and \nGanymede, Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto. If there’s this much potential for life\nto exist in our own tiny solar system, what unimagined secrets might the \nrest of the universe contain? "

        "text": "For many of us, a typical day involves interactions\nwith hundreds of companies. Buying their goods, using their services, even wearing their names. Corporations and companies have become such a familiar part \nof the modern landscape that it's easy to forget they're \nartificial entities created to allow real people\nto do business. But there are some types of companies that aren't engaged \nin any business at all. Instead, these anonymous companies exist mainly to disguise \npeople doing things they'd rather not have \nthe public know about. And these people go to great lengths\nto hide any links between their names and the companies they own. The life of an anonymous company usually begins in what's known\nas a secrecy jurisdiction, a place whose laws allow \nnew companies to be registered with little disclosure about who owns\nor controls them. Some may simply not require\ncollecting that information. Others may collect it, but make it nearly inaccessible\nto anyone else. And the lack of incentive to verify\ncompanies' real owners makes it easy for people\nto cover their tracks. For example, someone may register\na company in the name of a relative, an associate, or even a nominee director who acts on instruction \nfrom the company's actual owner while keeping their name confidential. Once registered, a company can do many \nof the same things as a human being, like opening bank accounts, buying and owning assets, and transferring money. What's more, it can be listed as the owner\nof other companies, including ones opened in places\nwith stricter disclosure rules. This allows someone to create\na complex world-wide chain of ownership that can take years to unravel. A company based in the U.S. may be wholly owned by another one\nin Liechtenstein, which is owned in turn by one\nin the British Virgin Islands. And an anonymous company can be\ntransferred to a new owner at any time with no public record of the change. So why all the anonymity? Defenders of financial secrecy argue\nthat wealthy individuals need it to avoid intrusive media attention and threats to personal security. But while this may sometimes be justified, anonymous companies play a role\nin almost every type of economic crime, including many major corruption cases. They are used by corporations \nevading taxes, rogue governments skirting sanctions, terrorists buying arms, and dictators financing wars. Organized crime groups launder\ntheir profits through anonymous companies. Corrupt government officials award\nvaluable contracts to corporations they secretly own. International oligarchs with criminal\nconnections or questionable pasts have used anonymous companies\nto discretely buy luxury apartments in cities like London and New York City, keeping them as safe stores of wealth. And even when criminals are convicted, their anonymously held assets may be difficult for authorities \nto locate or seize, making it harder for victims \nto be compensated. Efforts are now underway to chip away \nat these crime-enabling mechanisms. International authorities and NGOs have called for requiring companies to\nstate who ultimately makes their decisions and benefits from their assets. But while progress is being made, international cooperation \nhas been difficult to achieve, as governments that profit from \nregistering anonymous companies are reluctant to lose business. And some of the most popular places\nfor this practice are located not on remote,\ntropical tax shelters, but within the same advanced nations\nwhich claim to be leading the fight for global financial transparency. But still, it's a fight worth fighting. Closing the legal loopholes that enable\nanonymous companies would help us cut down on corruption\nand illegal activity. It would also allow us, \nas the general public, to better understand the flow\nof enormous sums of money that impact politics, our daily lives,\nand the health of our world. "

        "text": "Symmetry is everywhere in nature, and we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly shaped leaf, or a butterfly with intricate patterns\nmirrored on each wing. But it turns out that asymmetry\nis pretty important, too, and more common than you might think, from crabs with one giant pincer claw to snail species whose shells'\nalways coil in the same direction. Some species of beans only climb up\ntheir trellises clockwise, others, only counterclockwise, and even though the human body\nlooks pretty symmetrical on the outside, it's a different story on the inside. Most of your vital organs \nare arranged asymmetrically. The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas\nlie towards the left. The gallbladder and most of your liver\nare on the right. Even your lungs are different. The left one has two lobes,\nand the right one has three. The two sides of your brain look similar,\nbut function differently. Making sure this asymmetry is distributed\nthe right way is critical. If all your internal organs are flipped,\na condition called situs inversus, it's often harmless. But incomplete reversals can be fatal, especially if the heart is involved. But where does this asymmetry come from, since a brand-new embryo looks identical\non the right and left. One theory focuses \non a small pit on the embryo called a node. The node is lined with tiny hairs\ncalled cilia, while tilt away from the head\nand whirl around rapidly, all in the same direction. This synchronized rotation pushes fluid\nfrom the right side of the embryo to the left. On the node's left-hand rim, other cilia sense this fluid flow and activate specific genes\non the embryo's left side. These genes direct the cells\nto make certain proteins, and in just a few hours, the right and left sides of the embryo\nare chemically different. Even though they still look the same, these chemical differences are eventually\ntranslated into asymmetric organs. Asymmetry shows up in the heart first. It begins as a straight tube\nalong the center of the embryo, but when the embryo \nis around three weeks old, the tube starts to bend into a c-shape and rotate towards \nthe right side of the body. It grows different \nstructures on each side, eventually turning into the familiar\nasymmetric heart. Meanwhile, the other major organs\nemerge from a central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions. But some organisms, like pigs,\ndon't have those embryonic cilia and still have asymmetric internal organs. Could all cells be \nintrinsically asymmetric? Probably. Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches\nthat all curl in the same direction, and human cells cultured \ninside a ring-shaped boundary tend to line up \nlike the ridges on a cruller. If we zoom in even more, we see that many \nof cells' basic building blocks, like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars,\nare inherently asymmetric. Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes, and those proteins control \nwhich way cells migrate and which way embryonic cilia twirl. These biomolecules \nhave a property called chirality, which means that a molecule \nand its mirror image aren't identical. Like your right and left hands, \nthey look the same, but trying to put your right\nin your left glove proves they're not. This asymmetry at the molecular level\nis reflected in asymmetric cells, asymmetric embryos, and finally asymmetric organisms. So while symmetry may be beautiful, asymmetry holds an allure of its own, found in its graceful whirls, its organized complexity, and its striking imperfections. "

        "text": "A rabbit attempts to play a church organ, while a knight fights a giant snail and a naked man blows a trumpet \nwith his rear end. Painted with squirrel-hair brushes \non vellum or parchment by monks, nuns, and urban craftspeople, these bizarre images populate the \nmargins of the most prized books from the Middle Ages. Their illustrations often tell a second \nstory as rich as the text itself. Some images appear in many \ndifferent illuminated manuscripts, and often reinforce the religious \ncontent of the books they decorated. For example, a porcupine picking \nup fruit on its spines could represent the devil stealing \nthe fruits of faith-- or Christ taking up the sins of mankind. Medieval lore stated that a hunter \ncould only capture a unicorn when it lay its horn in \nthe lap of a virgin, so a unicorn could symbolize \neither sexual temptation or Christ being captured by his enemies. Rabbits, meanwhile, could represent \nhuman’s lustful natures— and could redeem themselves through \nattempts to make sacred music despite their failings. All of these references would have \nbeen familiar to medieval Europeans from other art forms and oral tradition, though some have grown more \nmysterious over the centuries. Today, no one can say for sure what the common \nmotif of a knight fighting a snail means— or why the knight so often \nappears to be losing. The snail might be a symbol of the \ninevitability of death, which defeats even the strongest knights. Or it could represent humility, and a \nknight’s need to vanquish his own pride. Many illuminated manuscripts were \ncopies of religious or classical texts, and the bookmakers incorporated their \nown ideas and opinions in illustrations. The butt tuba, for example, was likely shorthand to \nexpress disapproval with-- or add an ironic spin to--\nthe action in the text. Illuminations could also be used to \nmake subversive political commentary. The text of the \"Smithfield Decretals\" details the Church’s laws and \npunishments for lawbreakers. But the margins show a fox being \nhanged by geese, a possible allusion to the common people \nturning on their powerful oppressors. In the \"Chronica Majora,\" Matthew Paris summarized a \nscandal of his day, in which the Welsh prince Griffin plummeted to his death \nfrom the tower of London. Some believed the prince fell, \nParis wrote, while others thought he was pushed. He added his own take in the margins, which show the prince falling to his death while trying to escape on a rope \nmade of bed-sheets. Some margins told stories of \na more personal nature. \"The Luttrell Psalter,\" a book of psalms and prayers commissioned \nby Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, shows a young woman having her hair done, while a young man catches a bird in a net. The shaved patch on his \nhead is growing out, indicating that he is a clergyman \nneglecting his duties. This alludes to a family scandal where a young cleric ran away with Sir \nGeoffrey’s daughter Elizabeth. The family’s personal spiritual advisor \nlikely painted it into the book to remind his clients of their failings and encourage their spiritual development. Some artists even painted themselves \ninto the manuscripts. The opening image of Christine de \nPisan’s collected works shows de Pisan presenting \nthe book to the Queen of France. The queen was so impressed by de Pisan's \nprevious work that she commissioned her own copy. Such royal patronage enabled her to establish her own \npublishing house in Paris. The tradition of illuminated manuscripts \nlasted for over a thousand years. The books were created by individuals or \nteams for uses as wide-ranging as private prayer aids, service books \nin churches, textbooks, and protective talismans to \ntake into battle. Across all this variation, those tricky little drawings \nin the margins are a unique window into the \nminds of medieval artists. "

        "text": "As we walk through our daily environments, we're surrounded by exotic creatures that are too small to see \nwith the naked eye. We usually imagine these \nmicroscopic organisms, or microbes, as asocial cells that float around\nby themselves. But in reality, \nmicrobes gather by the millions to form vast communities \nknown as biofilms. Natural biofilms are like \nminiature jungles filled with many kinds of microbes\nfrom across the web of life. Bacteria and archaea mingle with\nother microbes like algae, fungi, and protozoa, forming dense, organized structures\nthat grow on almost any surface. When you pad across a river bottom, touch the rind of an aged cheese, tend your garden soil, or brush your teeth, you're coming into contact with these\ninvisible ecosystems. To see how biofilms come about, let's watch one as it develops\non a submerged river rock. This type of biofilm might begin\nwith a few bacteria swimming through their liquid environment. The cells use rotating flagella\nto propel towards the surface of the rock, which they attach to with the help\nof sticky appendages. Then, they start producing an\nextracellular matrix that holds them together as they divide\nand reproduce. Before long, microcolonies arise, clusters of cells sheathed in this slimy,\nglue-like material. Microcolonies grow to become towers, while water channels flow around them, functioning like a basic \ncirculatory system. But why do microbes build \nsuch complex communities when they could live alone? For one thing, microbes \nliving in a biofilm are rooted in a relatively \nstable microenvironment where they may have access \nto a nutrient source. There's also safety in numbers. Out in the deep, dark wilderness\nof the microbial world, isolated microbes face serious risks. Predators want to eat them, immune systems seek to destroy them, and there are physical dangers, too, like running out of water\nand drying up. However, in a biofilm, \nthe extracellular matrix shields microbes from external threats. Biofilms also enable interactions\nbetween individual cells. When microbes are packed against \neach other in close proximity, they can communicate, exchange genetic information, and engage in cooperative\nand competitive social behaviors. Take the soil in your garden, home to thousands of bacterial species. As one species colonizes a plant root, its individual cells might differentiate\ninto various subpopulations, each carrying out a specific task. Matrix producers pump out \nthe extracellular goo, swimmers assemble flagella\nand are free to move about or migrate, and spore-formers produce dormant,\ntough endospores that survive starvation, temperature extremes, and harmful radiation. This phenomenon is called \ndivision of labor. Ultimately, it gives rise to \na sophisticated system of cooperation that's somewhat like \na multicellular organism in itself. But because biofilms often contain\nmany different microbes that aren't closely related to each other, interactions can also be competitive. Bacteria launch vicious attacks \non their competitors by secreting chemicals \ninto the environment, or by deploying molecular spears\nto inject nearby cells with toxins that literally blow them up. In the end, competition \nis all about resources. If one species eliminates another, it keeps more space and food for itself. Although this dramatic life cycle\noccurs beyond the limits of our vision, microbial communities provide humans\nand other species with tangible, and sometimes even delicious, benefits. Microbes make up a major fraction\nof the biomass on Earth and play a critical role \nwithin the global ecosystem that supports all larger organisms, including us. They produce much of the oxygen we breath, and are recruited to clean up\nenvironmental pollution, like oil spills, or to treat our waste water. Not to mention, biofilms are normal\nand flavor enhancing parts of many of the foods we enjoy, including cheese, salami, and kombucha. So the next time you brush your teeth, bite into that cheese rind, sift through garden soil, or skip a river stone, look as close as you can. Imagine the microbial jungles \nall around you waiting to be discovered and explored. "

The psychic told me my heart\ncarries too much weight Said for 20 dollars she’d tell me what to do I handed her the twenty, she said “stop worrying darling, you \nwill find a good man soon.” The first psychotherapist said I should \nspend 3 hours a day sitting in a dark closet with my eyes closed \nand my ears plugged. I tried it once but couldn’t \nstop thinking about how gay it was to be\nsitting in the closet. The yogi told me to stretch \neverything but truth, said focus on the outbreaths, said everyone finds happiness if they can care more about what they\ncan give than what they get. The pharmacist said klonopin,\nlamictil, lithium, Xanax. The doctor said an antipsychotic\nmight help me forget what the trauma said The trauma said don’t write this poem. Nobody wants to hear you cry \nabout the grief inside your bones But my bones said “Tyler Clementi dove into the Hudson River\nconvinced he was entirely alone.” My bones said “write the poem.” To the lamplight. Considering the river bed. To the chandelier of your fate hanging by a thread. To everyday you could not get out of bed. To the bulls eye of your wrist To anyone who has ever wanted to die. I have been told, sometimes, \nthe most healing thing we can do- Is remind ourselves over and over and over Other people feel this too The tomorrow that has come and gone And it has not gotten better When you are half finished writing\nthat letter to your mother that says “I swear to God I tried” But when I thought I hit bottom, \nit started hitting back There is no bruise like the bruise\nloneliness kicks into your spine So let me tell you I know there are days it looks like \nthe whole world is dancing in the streets when you break down like the doors\nof their looted buildings You are not alone and wondering who will \nbe convicted of the crime of insisting you keep loading your grief into \nthe chamber of your shame You are not weak just because \nyour heart feels so heavy I have never met a heavy heart that wasn’t\na phone booth with a red cape inside Some people will never understand \nthe kind of superpower it takes for some people to just walk outside Some days I know my smile looks like\nthe gutter of a falling house But my hands are always holding tight\nto the ripchord of believing A life can be rich like the soil Make food of decay Turn wound into highway Pick me up in a truck with that \nbumper sticker that says “it is no measure of good health\nto be well adjusted to a sick society” I have never trusted anyone with \nthe pulled back bow of my spine the way I trust the ones who \ncome undone at the throat Screaming for their pulse \nto find the fight to pound Four nights before Tyler Clementi \njumped from the George Washington bridge I was sitting in a hotel room\nin my own town Calculating exactly what I had to swallow \nto keep a bottle of sleeping pills down What I know about living \nis the pain is never just ours Every time I hurt I know\nthe wound is an echo So I keep a listening for the moment\nwhen the grief becomes a window When I can see what I couldn’t see before, through the glass of \nmy most battered dream, I watched a dandelion lose\nits mind in the wind and when it did, it scattered \na thousand seeds.

        "text": "A cat’s bladder can only store \na golf ball’s worth of urine. For humans, it’s a coffee mug \nand for elephants, a kitchen trash can. An elephant’s bladder is 400 times \nthe size of a cat’s, but it doesn’t take an elephant 400 times\nlonger to pee. So, how does this work? The answer lies in what scientists call\nthe “Other Golden Rule.” It applies to mammals, which pee out\nsome of their wastes in a yellowy liquid. Other classes of animals use different\nsystems and methods to excrete waste. The Rule describes how urinary organs\nand forces change with body size, enabling a range of mammals\nto achieve similarly rapid relief. There are two main factors \ncontributing to urination speed: bladder pressure and gravity. Bladder pressure is created \nwhen mammals contract their muscles to squeeze urine out. This pressure is equal to the applied \nmuscular force per unit area but, since these factors scale proportionally, bladder pressure doesn’t actually \nchange much depending on body size. Meanwhile, the effects of gravity\ndo vary across species. Mammals have a pipe-like organ \ncalled the urethra that transports urine \nfrom a higher elevation to a lower one— specifically, from the bladder \ndown to where urine exits the body. In doing so, the urethra harnesses \nthe power of Torricelli’s Law, which states that flow rate \nincreases with container height. Take these two containers holding \nthe same volume of liquid. When identically punctured at the bottom, the vertical container drains \nnearly twice as fast. This is because the water’s falling\nfrom a greater elevation difference. By transporting urine from high to low, \nthe urethra has a similar effect. The urethra is probably not perfectly\nvertical, so its length doesn’t tell us exactly \nhow far the urine falls. However, it’s a good approximation. The urethra’s diameter \nalso affects flow rate. When that vertical container’s exit hole \nhas a larger diameter, the water drains out even faster. The length and diameter \nof an animal’s urethra varies depending on its species \nand whether it has a penis or vagina. For example, a female elephant \nhas a meter-long urethra with a thirty-five millimeter diameter. A person with a vagina has a urethra\nthat is more than 20 times shorter and 5 times thinner. The elephant’s longer, wider urethra \nis what allows it to urinate for a comparable amount\nof time as a human. Indeed, if an elephant had the urethra\nof a housecat, it might take it about 2 hours\nto drain its bladder. It’s hypothesized \nthat the Other Golden Rule is conserved because quicker pees \nmay both reduce vulnerability to predators and flush out disease-causing pathogens. But the Rule has limitations. It’s only been shown to apply \nto non-aquatic mammals. And the Rule doesn’t apply to mammals\nunder three kilograms. They actually pee in droplets,\nnot continuous streams, because surface tension \nbreaks up their tiny jets of urine. Even within non-aquatic mammals \nabove three kilograms, different behaviors disrupt \nthe Other Golden Rule. Male dogs don’t always fully empty \ntheir bladders and will instead tinkle in short spurts \nto mark their territory. Male pandas sometimes pee in handstands,\nmarking bark higher up on trees in order to broadcast their scent\nto potential mates. Handstand pees take longer \nbecause urine must work against gravity. Underwater pees are also lengthier because the external water pressure\ncounteracts the internal forces resulting from elevation difference. Whether it’s with the intensity \nof a fire hydrant or a squirt gun, this system swiftly delivers our urine\nto the outside world. "

        "text": "As a breeze blows through the savannah, a snake-shaped tube stretches into the air\nand scans the horizon like a periscope. But it’s not seeing— \nit’s sniffing for odors like the scent of a watering hole \nor the musk of a dangerous predator. The trunk’s owner \nis a young African elephant. At only 8 years old, she still has \na lot to learn about her home. Fortunately, she’s not alone. Elephants are extremely social creatures, with females living in tight-knit herds \nled by a single matriarch. And every member of the group \nhas one of the most versatile tools in the savannah to help them get by. Today her herd is looking for water. Or, more accurately, smelling for water. Elephants have more genes devoted \nto smell than any other creature, making them the best sniffers\nin the animal kingdom. Even at our elephant’s young age,\nher trunk is already 1.5 meters long and contains five times as many \nolfactory receptors as a human nose, allowing her to smell standing water\nseveral kilometers away. And now, the matriarch uses her own keen\nsense of smell to plot the herd’s course. Their journey is long,\nso our elephant keeps her energy up by snacking on the occasional patch \nof thick grass. But this light lunch \nisn’t just about staying fed— she’s also looking for clues. Like many other mammals, vents in the roof of an elephant’s mouth \nlead directly to the vomeronasal organ. This structure can detect chemical\nsignals left by other elephants. So as the herd forages, \nthey’re also gathering information about what other herds have come this way. All the while, the group’s adults are \non the lookout for signs of other animals, including potential threats. Fortunately, while lions might attack\na young or sickly elephant, few are foolish enough to take \non a healthy adult. Weighing 3 tons and bearing powerful tusks\nnearly a meter long, our elephant’s mother is a force\nto be reckoned with. Her dexterous trunk doubles \nas a powerful, flexible arm. Containing no bones\nand an estimated 40,000 muscles, these agile appendages \ncan bend, twist, contract, and expand. At 8 years old, our elephant’s trunk\nis already strong enough to move small fallen trees, while finger-like extensions allow for \ndelicate maneuvers like wiping her eye. She can even grab a nearby branch, break it to just the right length,\nand wave off pesky insects. Suddenly, the matriarch stops their march\nand sniffs the air. Using smell alone, elephants can recognize\neach member of their herd, and their exceptional memories can \nretain the smells of elephants outside their herd as well. It’s one of these old but familiar odors\nthat’s caught the matriarch’s attention. She bellows into the air, sending out a sound wave \nthat rings across the savannah. But it travels even further\nthrough the earth as infrasonic rumbles. Elephants up to 10 kilometers away can\nreceive these rumbles with their feet. If the matriarch’s nose is right,\nher herd should expect a response. Smelling the secretions \nfrom her daughter’s temporal glands, our elephant’s mother can sense \nher daughter’s unease about this unfamiliar encounter. As the herd of unknown\nelephants approaches, trunks from both herds rise into the air,\nsounding trumpets of alarm. But upon recognition, apprehension \nquickly gives way to happy rumbles. Members from each herd recognize\neach other despite time apart, and many investigate each other’s mouths\nwith their trunks to smell what their counterparts \nhave been eating. With the reunion now in full swing, both\nherds head toward their final destination: the long-awaited watering hole. Here, older elephants suck up to 8 liters \nof water into their trunks before spraying the contents \non themselves to cool off. Meanwhile, our young elephant plays \nin the mud with her peers, digging into the muck \nand even using her trunk as a snorkel to breathe while submerged. The pair of matriarchs look \ncontentedly on their herds, before turning their trunks \nto the horizon once more. "

        "text": "A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut. A cannonball sewn \ninto a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers \nsudden electrical pulses. These old items were all\nintended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity\nfor millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can\nbe a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? \nAnd when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a\ngentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate \nfrom the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles \naround these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, \nanatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage \nand lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,\nthe stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues \nmay vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point\nin our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign \nof a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%\nof people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it \ncan lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually\ncaused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses\nin breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea\ncalled central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily\nfails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually \na less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing \nobstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more\nseconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,\nto catch your breath. In doing so, you might make \na snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,\nit could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues\nare getting less oxygen. As you experience periods\nof low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get\noxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure \nand puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea\ncan be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality\nrest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,\nand chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing\nobstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, \nthicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk \nbecause, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,\nfurther narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep\ncan cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors \nto obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck\ncan constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss \nas a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting\nyour alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding \nsleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown\nto alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, \nand devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably\ntreated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering\na constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep\napnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,\nthey may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth \ninvestigating with a doctor. After all, everyone needs a chance \nto catch their breath— and some z’s... "

        "text": "In the mid-1800s, soon after American whaling ships\nbegan operating in the North Pacific, an interesting trend emerged. Whalers saw a 58% drop in their successful\nstrikes within just a few years. Sperm whales in the region had\nsuddenly become much harder to kill. Generally, when predators\nlike orcas are nearby, sperm whales protect their most vulnerable by forming defensive circles\nat the surface. But this behavior made them\nsusceptible to whaling ships. It seems that sperm whales\nin the North Pacific were somehow able to quickly\nadapt to this reality. Groups that likely hadn’t yet experienced\nhuman attacks began escaping whaling boats\non fast currents instead of forming defensive circles. And, based on what we’re starting\nto understand about sperm whales, it seems possible they were actually\nbroadcasting survival strategies to one another. Indeed, unbeknownst to whalers, spermaceti, the material they killed for, is an essential part of the sperm whale’s\nsophisticated communication and echolocation system. This waxy substance fills a cavity\nin the sperm whale’s head. And their head is mostly comprised\nof an expanded nose that serves as a highly calibrated\nsonar system. Sperm whales generate some of the loudest\nbiological noises on record, communicate copiously using\nan array of complex vocalization styles, and have the largest brains on Earth. They spend most of their time searching\nthe ocean's depths for prey. They can stay submerged for over an hour,\nand dive deeper than 1,200 meters, far beyond sunlight’s reach,\nwhere they’re guided by sound. The loudest noise recorded underwater\nis around 270 decibels. Sperm whale-generated sounds\ncan reach 230. And they frequently fix\ntheir high-intensity echolocation clicks on squid. Some of the air they inhale through their\nblowhole is routed into their lungs, while the rest enters a complex,\nsound-producing system. There, air is funneled through lip-like\nappendages at the front of their heads. This generates a sound that travels\nbackwards through their spermaceti organ, bounces off an air sac,\nthen traverses another waxy organ, which amplifies and directs the sound. The click exits the sperm whale’s head\na powerful, focused beam. It’s suspected that\nthe returning vibrations are received by the whale’s lower jaw\nand directed into the ears. Then, their brain’s expanded\nauditory processing region analyzes the quality of the echoes\nto map their surroundings in the darkness. With this mechanism, sperm whales\ncan locate squid 300 meters away. Scientists think squid don’t hear\nthese high-frequency clicks— even as they turn into rapid buzzes\nand creaks as the whale closes in. Sperm whales can eat more than a ton\nof squid every day. Their stomachs and feces are usually\nfull of indigestible squid beaks, and their skin often scarred\nby squid tentacles. When they're not hunting, however, sperm whales use an entirely\ndifferent vocal repertoire. Mature males make clang noises, which scientists suspect play a role\nin mating. And most other sperm whales live\nin social family groups. Though their communication might get\ninterrupted when predators are near or human-generated noises dominate, they generally chatter at length\nat the water’s surface. Sperm whales do this using patterned click\nsequences akin to Morse code, called codas, which are thought to function\nas social identity markers. Researchers have identified dozens\nof distinct types of codas, according to patterns in the numbers\nof clicks used and their rhythm and tempo. Some codas are more ubiquitous, while others vary greatly according\nto family groups and individuals. All families in a given region that consistently use some of the same\ncharacteristic coda patterns share a dialect\nand belong to the same vocal clan. Each sperm whale calf goes\nthrough a multi-year period of babbling, where they experiment\nwith different sounds before becoming fluent\nin their clan’s coda dialect. How and what exactly sperm whales\ncommunicate to each other is currently unknown, but there are indications that the\ninformation can be sophisticated. Biologists, roboticists, linguists,\ncryptographers, and artificial intelligence experts are collaborating to monitor and analyze\nsperm whale vocalizations. The aim is to finally decipher\nwhat they're saying. "

        "text": "The largest rainforest in the world, \nthe Amazon, exists between two rivers—\nbut not in the way you might think. At ground level, the Amazon River\nand its tributaries weave their path. But above the canopy,\nbigger waterways are on the move. These flying rivers are almost invisible,\nbut are essential to life on Earth. As rain seeps into the soil, trees draw water\nback up through their roots and pump it through their trunks\nfor nourishment. The leaves and stems transpire,\nor release, excess water in the form of vapor. In the Amazon, a fully grown tree transpires between 200\nand 1,000 liters of water a day. This collective release creates\na startling phenomenon: huge jets of rapid, humid air\nthat constantly flow above the canopy. Dubbed “flying rivers”\nby a Brazilian climatologist, these aerial waterways carry\nabout 20 billion tons of water through the air per day. This is more than the Amazon River’s\ndaily output into the ocean. Along the equator,\nthe trade winds blow from east to west. Caught in these winds, flying rivers flow\nin the same direction before encountering the Andes. The mountains act like a giant barrier, causing the winds and rivers\nto redirect southwards. When flying rivers meet\nthe masses of cold air, they grow heavier and release\ntorrents of water. In this way, they bring rain,\ncooler temperatures, and humidity to much of South America. But these waterways are under threat. Clearing the Amazon\nfor agriculture and industry is already causing flying rivers \nto dry up, leading to drought and hotter temperatures\nacross South America. If this pattern continues, swaths of the continent may be reduced\nto desert in a matter of decades. In response, a radical movement is working\nintensely to keep the rainforest— and the flying rivers— alive. The northwest of the Peruvian Amazon\nis the territory of the Wampís Nation, a community of over 15,000 people who manage over 130,000 square kilometers\nof land. These Indigenous people have lived\nin the rainforest for thousands of years, practicing sustainable hunting,\nfishing, and agriculture. For the Wampís, protecting the rainforest has long meant\nfighting invaders. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, Wampís people resisted\nand expelled the Incas and later the Spanish colonists\nwho exploited the rainforest. Today, the Wampís Nation are still\nbattling extractive industries— and the policies that sanction them. For instance, since the 1960s, the Peruvian government has been\nlicensing the Wampís’ territory to corporations for gold mining\nand oil extraction. These activities poison the rivers,\nclear thousands of trees, and threaten the Wampís way of life. In 2015, after years of protests\nand negotiations, the community formed the\nAutonomous Territorial Government of the Wampís Nation. While the Wampís people remain\nPeruvian citizens, they seek recognition as a government responsible for their own lands, forests,\nand internal affairs. In its policies, the Wampís Nation\nprioritizes collective land ownership, cultural preservation,\nand conservation of animals, plants, and natural cycles\nthat protect the rainforest. This is the foundation of their\nphilosophy of Tarimat Pujut, or living in harmony with nature to ensure food, friendships,\nand quality of life. The high, humid forest\nof the Wampís Nation is crucial to the flying river cycle, transpiring over 34 million liters\nof water a day that flow to Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. To track this output, Wampís scientists\nmeasure rainfall, monitor the wind, and weigh water levels in leaves and soil. One of their climate goals is to defend\nthis and other natural systems, including native soil\nthat acts as a carbon sink and the forest itself as a fire barrier. The Wampís Nation constantly battles\ncorporations that threaten these systems. Between 2016 and 2018, the community fought illegal gold mining\nalong the Santiago River. They organized protests,\nuncovered mercury pollution, guarded the area,\nand attacked illegal machinery for months, eventually expelling the miners. And in 2017, the Wampís Nation\nsuccessfully petitioned a court to bar a private oil company\nfrom their land. While these are significant victories, the Wampís Nation and other Indigenous\ngroups need more recognition and support. Indigenous people and local communities\nlive in and manage more than a quarter of the world’s land, but only have legal ownership\nto a small percentage of it. And less than 1% of international climate\nand forest funds go to their crucial conservation efforts. This is despite the fact that forests\nmanaged by Indigenous people have better survival rates. The Amazon is often described with\nlanguage evocative of a giant organism— one that grows, dies, breathes\nin carbon dioxide and exhales oxygen. The processes that sustain it\nweave together in a complex and often invisible web of water, air,\nsoil, and human activity— both destructive and protective. We are far from understanding it\nin its entirety, but some are closer than others. "
