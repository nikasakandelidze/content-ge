       "\"0\\nuh these are some guys i saw in kyoto3\\nand they're tearing down a scaffolding6\\nand i just think they're9\\namazingly poetic and how they do their12\\nwork13\\nso in a startup um16\\nfounders basically have to figure out19\\nhow to optimize for a relationship that21\\nlasts for like22\\n10 years and that's a crazy thing to do25\\nwith someone you might only know for a27\\ncouple of months28\\nor have only known in a sort of work30\\nsetting and the thing is like the only32\\nmodels33\\nfor understanding that kind of36\\nrelationship37\\nactually come probably from our parents40\\nand so i'd like to start off with some42\\nmarriage research43\\nso this is john gottman he studied his47\\nmarriages in seattle he's been featured49\\nin this american life51\\nand a bunch of different places and52\\nbasically he has a cool magic trick he54\\ncan watch55\\na couple fight about something for 1558\\nminutes59\\nand predict with 85 accuracy whether62\\nthey'll be divorced or not63\\nuh four years from now if he watches66\\nthem for an67\\nhour and have them also share their69\\nhopes and dreams his prediction rating70\\ngoes up to 94 percent and so72\\nthis is the same videos they would show74\\nto priests75\\npsychologists psychiatrists marriage78\\ncounselors79\\nsuccessfully married couples and they81\\ndon't predict better than random chance83\\nand so john he's figured something out86\\nthere's something about the way we will87\\nhave an88\\nargument that determines longevity and92\\none of the most surprising things that93\\nhe discovered was that it's not that95\\nsuccessfully married people who will97\\nlast a long time that they never fight100\\nturns out everybody fights and103\\nwe all fight about the exact same things107\\nmoney kids sex time110\\njealousy and the in-laws114\\nand time is usually what are we gonna do117\\nwith our free time118\\nuh and the thing that's interesting is121\\nlike122\\ni think all of these map out to the123\\nstuff that we're gonna fight about125\\nin a company and so you130\\nwith your co-founders are gonna have132\\nthese issues133\\nand the thing is what's nice about135\\nknowing everyone fights137\\nand that you know what you're gonna138\\nfight about is that we can make a plan141\\nfor figuring out how to deal with this144\\none situation145\\nthat will determine whether we will work147\\ntogether149\\non the thing that we're so passionate150\\nabout down the road153\\nthe other thing that john gottman154\\nfigured out is that there's157\\nfour major things we want to avoid160\\nwhen we're fighting and when we do these163\\nthings164\\nthey will create sort of leading166\\nindicators168\\nthat the relationship is in serious170\\ntrouble171\\ni'm gonna go through each one of these172\\nso criticism174\\nuh this is basically like you're talking177\\nwith someone178\\nand you're like hey you know what i have179\\na serious concern about this bug that182\\nwe are trying to fix and i'm really184\\nworried about this thing185\\nand i'm not sure that we're going to be187\\nable to deploy on time and someone comes188\\nup and says like189\\nwell you know what i don't like is the191\\nfact that you leave a bunch of dirty193\\ndishes in the sink194\\nand criticism is basically this idea196\\nthat we don't fight on one198\\ntopic we start trying to bring all these201\\nother issues202\\ninto play instead of addressing the one204\\nissue at hand206\\ndangerous contempt this is pretty easy209\\none209\\nit's intention to insult so basically i212\\nsay like hey i'm worried about this bug214\\nand we're not going to be able to deploy215\\non time216\\nand someone says i don't like your face218\\nright220\\nthat's contempt and what you want to223\\navoid is making things224\\npersonal right because we're in a227\\nbusiness228\\nthis one's um kind of easy to understand231\\nis that someone not owning233\\nresponsibility about the problem and so235\\nwe can't move236\\nforward because someone won't admit that238\\nthere's a problem239\\nout there we defend that we haven't done242\\nanything wrong and therefore there can't244\\nbe244\\nresolution between two people the other246\\nperson thinks247\\nthere's a problem this one is a super249\\ndangerous one250\\nand it's when basically you're like hey253\\ni got a problem254\\nand the person just walks away won't257\\nengage won't talk to you258\\nand so there can be no way to create any261\\nkind of resolution263\\nso just as you wouldn't do this266\\nwithout uh doing some of this270\\nwe want to make a plan and i'm going to272\\ntalk about four different things that we274\\ncan do274\\nthat helps avoid and protect us from276\\nthose four horsemen278\\nthe first one is divide and conquer282\\nand this feels pretty straightforward283\\nbut you want to do this early285\\nin the relationship with your286\\nco-founders and in the in the early288\\nstages of your company290\\nso here's our list again of the types of292\\nthings that293\\nwe might have problems with and in the296\\nearly stages of the start297\\nlet's say adora and i are doing a299\\nstartup together it's just her and me301\\nthen what you want to do is just kind of303\\nsay like oh who's responsible305\\nwhat stuff and what this will do is like308\\nif there's a problem310\\nin that category then that person that312\\nwe have assigned ahead of time314\\nto be in charge will be the ones that318\\nwill ultimately either make the decision321\\nor ultimately are responsible323\\nthis protects us from defensiveness326\\nso notice here on jealousy this is about328\\ncompetition329\\nusually and so usually in the early332\\nstages of your startup you should not be333\\nworried about competition334\\ncompetition is not usually what kills336\\nyou in the very early stages of your337\\ncompany339\\nas your company ages it might change and342\\nlook something like this343\\nyou'll assign things to different sort345\\nof positions and heads347\\nand as a result then when their350\\nproblems come up you know basically that352\\nsort of is delegated353\\nnow what happens357\\nif uh things go out of hand even up at360\\nthose360\\nsort of levels well basically363\\nwhat you want to do is decide after you366\\ndelegate367\\nwho has ownership determine what is369\\nsuccess and failure371\\nyou want to know also ahead of time hey373\\nwe've divided up the task375\\nbut we also want to know is like hey376\\nwhen is there going to be interference378\\nwith a person that is supposed to be380\\nleading these decisions what is382\\nconsidered like its success enough that384\\nwe shouldn't be interfering just let385\\nthem do what they think is best387\\nand what is considered really bad so389\\nthat we have to interfere390\\nand something has to be done about it so393\\nin this case394\\ngood examples would be like hey you know398\\nif we've successfully fundraised like we400\\ndon't need to talk or like402\\nreplace the person that's responsible403\\nfor that uh if we're shipping on time405\\nif we're rated top three amongst our408\\nsort of peers or409\\nwe've built a referral program that's410\\nworking hey we don't need to be412\\ncriticizing the person that's working on414\\nthe stuff or they're doing a good job416\\non the corollary we want to define hey418\\nwhat are the things420\\nthat basically are going to trigger421\\nconversations423\\nreally hard conversations like hey if we426\\nhit426\\nthis sort of area we need to put the429\\nbrakes on and we need to discuss what's430\\ngoing on431\\nand actually try to resolve these433\\nproblems a lot of people like to435\\ndelegate stuff but they don't have437\\na way of saying hey when are we going to439\\nhave a conversation about this441\\nwhen there's trouble and these are442\\nreally really easy to do444\\nand the reason you want to do these445\\nearly while you're447\\nsober emotionally sober is because once450\\nyou get angry451\\nand emotions come into play then you454\\nmight not be thinking rationally456\\nnow ultimately in the end usually it's459\\nthe ceo460\\nin the company who has final say now you462\\nas a team can decide differently how you464\\nwant to resolve it if you just465\\nif you divvy up the stuff but ultimately468\\nwhoever's the ceo usually is the one who470\\nresolves it471\\nand if there's problems with the ceo473\\nthen it's the board474\\nin the early stages of startup the board476\\nis usually composed of just the founders478\\nso you have to ultimately work it out482\\nthe second defense against the force484\\nhorsemen is knowing yourself486\\nthis will protect you from stonewalling489\\nand what i mean490\\nis what is your attachment style494\\nso there was all this research that was495\\ndone in the 1960s about497\\nhow people approach relationships502\\nand basically it was determined that504\\nthere's sort of506\\nthree major types there's a secure509\\nattachment style and that means511\\nbasically it's like hey you know what i512\\ndon't have a problem514\\ngoing up to people uh relying on them518\\nand having them rely on me and sort of520\\nlike us creating a relationship i don't522\\nmind being vulnerable and i don't523\\ni don't mind other people being525\\nvulnerable with me that's called a526\\nsecure527\\nattachment style there's an anxious529\\nstyle so there's a type of person531\\nthat will be like you know what i kind533\\nof don't get534\\nenough love as not as much as i want i538\\nkind of want to like hold on to people540\\nand i kind of want to have people542\\nconstantly confirm with me544\\nthat they want to be with me i feel like546\\nit's a little difficult and then there's548\\nanother point549\\nthe kind of person just like i find it550\\nkind of difficult552\\ncreating relationships with people and i554\\nkind of want to run away sometimes555\\nbecause it's really scary558\\nor i'm worried that i'm going to mess it560\\nup561\\nand the thing that's super important563\\nhere especially with your co-founder is565\\nyou want to know566\\nyour co-founder's attachment style568\\nbecause that's going to dictate569\\nhow you are going to be able to resolve572\\nand understand your differences573\\nnow what it turns out oddly enough576\\nis that an anxious attachment person and580\\nan avoidant attachment person these are581\\nthe two581\\nmost common in the world there's not583\\nthat many like584\\nwell-developed secure people out there588\\nthey tend to want to be with one another590\\nso the person that wants to run away592\\nand the person that wants to cling and594\\nso what you have is someone who needs596\\nspace to make a decision and to process599\\nproblems and tension600\\nand the someone who needs validation602\\nconstantly the process605\\nconflict and issues and so when those608\\ntwo people are together and they don't609\\nrealize what the other person needs they610\\ndon't realize that they're going to have611\\nto bend612\\nto sort of make it work there's lots of615\\ngood books616\\non attachment styles there's a wonderful618\\nwikipedia page that covers it620\\ni would recommend watching this youtube621\\nvideo it's from school of life624\\nand what i would highly recommend is626\\nbasically627\\nunderstanding that like if you're with629\\nsomeone that is of the opposite type631\\nthat you're gonna have to do work either633\\nto reach across the aisle634\\nlike if you're an anxious person you're637\\ngonna and you're talking to an avoidant638\\nperson you just have to realize like oh640\\nthat person needs space but that doesn't642\\nmean they're running away from you644\\nand if you're an avoidant person with an647\\nanxious person648\\nthat if someone needs your attention or650\\nif you need your space then you have to652\\nlet them know it's like hey i'm going to654\\nbe back654\\ni realize that you're going to need an656\\nanswer for this i'm going to go away i'm658\\ngoing to figure stuff out and i promise659\\na time660\\nthat we will deal with this665\\ndocumented process so this will protect667\\nyou from criticism669\\nand so basically when you're emotionally672\\nsober673\\nit's the best time to create a process676\\nfor dealing with disagreements and the679\\nreason you want to do this is680\\nbecause once you're upset and angry and682\\nfilled with emotions684\\nyou are not going to be thinking685\\nstraight and so the odds are you might687\\nsay something you regret689\\nyou might say something that you don't691\\nmean and the other person might do so693\\nand then694\\nyou will have a much different problem696\\nthan the bug697\\nnot being fixed and deployed on time701\\nso one of my favorite examples of this703\\ncomes from the company called mater705\\nand they created a spreadsheet for707\\ndealing with708\\ndisagreements basically it's a710\\ndisagreement711\\nuh decision framework and basically it713\\njust talks about it's like hey715\\nwhen we have a disagreement we should716\\njust document it this helps make things718\\nreally really transparent719\\nmakes us understand both sides very very722\\nclearly723\\nwe talk about the different options we725\\nsay who made the decision726\\nwhat the decision was the date was done729\\nand then rationale730\\nand so when we walk through this process732\\nif we've decided this ahead of time734\\nthen it means that we are not afraid736\\nwhen disagreements come up it's like oh738\\nwe have a process for dealing with this740\\nand we will figure it out by filling out743\\nexcel743\\n[Music]747\\nthere's lots of different ways to do748\\nthis you don't have to follow their sort750\\nof very specific framework they have752\\nlots of really great justifications in753\\ntheir article754\\nyou just have to agree ahead of time757\\nwhat you want to758\\ndo so therefore when you are upset you760\\njust go okay761\\ngreat we have a process for this and763\\nprocess says764\\noh it says go have a timeout or eat a766\\nbologna sandwich767\\nor like take a nap first and then we'll771\\nfigure out what we have to do it could772\\nbe a process where it's like hey if774\\nthere's a real disagreement and both775\\nsides feel equally strong776\\nwe will flip a coin and then that will778\\nbe the decision for the test of time we780\\nwill let lady luck781\\ndecide it doesn't matter you just have783\\nto both agree786\\nthis strategy will protect you from788\\ncontempt789\\nso the way that you avoid793\\nmaking things personal is you have to794\\nfigure out way of communicating with797\\nanother in a way that will not be799\\nthreatening800\\nthere's an amazing book on this um it's803\\ncalled nonviolent communication by804\\nmarshall rosenberg806\\nand it helps you be honest with other809\\npeople809\\nwithout criticizing without insulting812\\nwithout putting down other people814\\nand the magic comes in the structure816\\nthat feels somewhat fake for people who818\\nare not into being touchy-feely820\\num basically when you're giving some823\\nkind of criticism824\\nyou want to basically have it in this826\\nformat so828\\nwhen some observation i feel an emotion831\\nbecause i'm needing some universal need834\\nwould you be able to request so we're837\\njust going to break down838\\neach one of these different parts and840\\nthey're all841\\nevery single one of these are tricky and843\\nit's a thing that a lot of people will845\\ntry to do and you'll spend your whole847\\nlife trying to get really good at848\\nand it gets really difficult so the851\\nfirst one852\\nis you need to make an observation855\\nversus856\\nhaving an evaluation so basically what858\\nyou want to do is859\\nstart your disagreement or criticism863\\nby anchoring it to something that is864\\nconcrete866\\nyou do not want it to be something that868\\nis connected to opinion it should be869\\nsomething870\\nthat you actually saw or heard because872\\ntherefore you can't874\\ndisagree with something that actually875\\nhappened versus something i heard a878\\ni heard be a rumor or something that has880\\nto do something that seems emotional or882\\nsomething that seems like an opinion883\\nso i'll give you an example um886\\nan observation would be like you said889\\nthat you'd send that document last week891\\nand i haven't received it893\\nall right so that is a great observation896\\nan evaluation that someone might say899\\ninstead in the heat of the moon900\\nis that you're lazy902\\n[Music]904\\nright that kind of feels like907\\nan observation but it's not it's910\\nevaluating the person give you another912\\nexample913\\nyour work is sloppy that is not916\\nobjective instead hey three of the920\\nnumbers in this report921\\nwere inaccurate that's where you want to924\\nstart926\\nyou're always late you want to be really929\\ncareful because that's a generalization931\\nit's an evaluation observation hey you934\\narrived 10 minutes late935\\nto the meeting this morning evaluation939\\nyou ignored me observation i sent you942\\ntwo943\\nemails and i haven't received the944\\nresponse946\\nnotice when we start with observation we949\\nstart with a fact that can't be refuted951\\nand so we're not going to end up arguing952\\nabout something else955\\nnotice all those other evaluations they958\\nimmediately959\\nwill trigger an emotion in you and so961\\nthat's why you want to be really careful962\\nthat when you start this criticism that964\\nyou don't start with one of those967\\nthe next is we have to talk about our969\\nemotions right so i saw971\\nthis irrefutable observation and it made976\\nme976\\nfeel something and what we have to be978\\nreally careful of979\\nis not saying thoughts but instead982\\ntalking about983\\nfeelings which is kind of odd but986\\nit's connected to the next point out in989\\nthe990\\nin the structure so an emotion will be i993\\nfeel frustrated right996\\nnow a thought would be and it could be998\\nput in the same structure as like i1000\\nfeel that you aren't taking this1002\\nseriously1003\\nand the way you can tell if something is1005\\na thought or a feeling1007\\nis you substitute the phrase i think1009\\nwith i feel1011\\nand it still works so i think1014\\nfrustrated doesn't work so that's a1017\\nfeeling1018\\ni think that you aren't taking this1020\\nseriously oh that's a thought1024\\nthere's a couple of emotions that we1026\\nhave to be particularly careful of1028\\none is anger because anger is usually1031\\ntied to a bunch of hosts of other things1033\\nso when someone says that i feel angry1036\\nyou1036\\nor you realizing that you feel angry you1039\\nwant to be really really specific about1041\\nwhat's causing the anger what's1043\\ntriggering it1044\\nthe other tricky emotions are evaluative1047\\nemotions and usually what you need to1050\\nfigure out is what1051\\nunderlines that evaluation so1054\\ni'll give you an example so i1058\\nfeel blamed right someone else is1062\\nevaluating me i feel blamed the impact1065\\nactually is i feel scared someone is1068\\nblaming me1069\\nand so i feel scared so it takes a lot1071\\nof work to understand that when someone1073\\nis giving me some1074\\nif i'm feeling like some kind of judging1076\\nfeeling what is that the core root of it1079\\nother examples are1081\\ni feel judged the actual impact is1084\\ni feel resentful1088\\ni feel misunderstood the impactful1091\\nstatement is actually1092\\ni feel frustrated i feel rejected1097\\nthe real impact is i feel hurt1100\\nit's super hard it's super super hard uh1104\\ni'm gonna have a link inside of this1106\\npresentation to a pdf it's three pages1109\\nof evaluative emotions1112\\nimpacted feelings you probably actually1114\\nare feeling and then connects us to1116\\na universal need that you need to1117\\novercome it which leads us to1120\\nour next thing every negative emotion1124\\nlies an unmet universal need1128\\nand so what that means is that like1131\\nwhen you're feeling one of these1133\\nfrustrated or blamed or scared1136\\nor hurt feelings there's something1139\\nthat's missing that you're going to need1142\\nand the thing that's really tricky about1144\\nuniversal needs is you have to be1145\\ncareful of realizing1147\\nis it a strategy or is it a need and1150\\nis it truly universal so i'll give an1152\\nexample1153\\nright you might be able to say i need a1156\\nsandwich1158\\nthat is not a universal need so you have1160\\nto be really careful1161\\nright and then you might say like i need1165\\na sandwich1165\\nto give me nourishment that's more like1168\\na strategy1170\\na much better way might be uh1176\\nlet me see here you might say something1178\\nlike i need1179\\nyou to copy me on every single email1183\\nbut the thing is that's not a universal1185\\nneed that becomes very very specific a1187\\nuniversal need would be1188\\ni need some transparency about this1191\\nprocess1193\\nyou have to be careful of not making1195\\nneeds about something that's very1196\\nspecific to yourself1198\\nor just that situation because once it's1200\\na universal need1201\\nthen it's something that everyone can1203\\nagree that everyone should sort of have1206\\nso other universal needs are like i need1208\\nsupport1210\\nand the way you turn it not into1211\\nuniversal need is by saying something1213\\nlike1213\\ni need support from you because not1216\\neveryone needs support from henry1218\\nright but everyone does need support1221\\nand it says you include from you1225\\nit stops being universal so you want to1227\\nbe really careful of this1228\\nokay requests versus1231\\ndemand so at the very end so basically1234\\nwe said like hey i've1235\\nnoticed something that can't be refuted1238\\ni've1238\\ntold you about a feeling and how it1240\\nimpacts me and i told you that basically1242\\nit results in1243\\nsome universal need that we all can1245\\nagree that we need1246\\nto have and now we get to saying1250\\nwhat we'd like to have changed as a1251\\nresult and what you want to make is a1253\\nrequest1254\\nnot a demand the difference is that a1257\\nrequest is an invitation1259\\nto the other person to meet our1261\\nuniversal needs1262\\nit's much easier to be able to do than1264\\nto say like i order you to do something1270\\nso what we want to do is1273\\nmake it very specific our requests1276\\nso i request for you to be more1279\\nrespectful1280\\nis not that great because who defines1283\\nwhat's respectful my1284\\nversion of respectful might be different1286\\nfrom someone else's your request should1288\\nbe something like1288\\ni request that you arrive to meetings on1292\\ntime1295\\nsay what you want don't say what you1298\\ndon't want so what a lot of people will1299\\nsay is that i request1301\\nthat you don't dismiss other people's1302\\nideas straight away1305\\nthe thing is it doesn't indicate the1307\\nbehavior that you do want1308\\nand so it becomes really difficult to1310\\nact on a better one would be i request1313\\nthat when a team member shares an idea1315\\nyou ask two or three probing questions1318\\nbefore sharing a conclusion1323\\nand then stay curious and so sometimes1326\\nyou might make a request and someone1328\\nmight say no1330\\nand what you need to do is not just1332\\nfreak out that the whole process1334\\nisn't working the idea is actually to be1337\\nlike hmm1339\\nmaybe i haven't put this request in a1341\\nway that can meet1342\\nmore needs than just myself could i do1345\\nthis in a way so that they can1346\\nunderstand and be on board1348\\nfor everyone to be sort of involved1351\\nif you want to learn more there's a1353\\nreally great article1355\\non delivering constructive feedback in1356\\ndifferent citizens by dave bailey this1358\\nis on medium i'll have a link to it1359\\nhe goes into far more detail and is a1362\\nvery very good1363\\nstarting point for giving out this1365\\nreally hard feedback1369\\nwe all know what technical debt is right1372\\nso when we're1373\\nbuilding out software really really1375\\nquickly and sometimes you're like1377\\nwell that's not going to scale real1379\\nreally well and it's going to be dirty1380\\nand quick but i'm going to get it out1381\\nthe door and1382\\ni'm just going to put that in the back1383\\nof my mind it's something i have to fix1384\\nlater1385\\nwell in our relationships one another1388\\nyou will incur emotional debt and unlike1392\\ntechnical debt1392\\nyou really don't want that to go for1394\\nvery long1396\\nyou want to pay this down every day1399\\nso it turns out also in john gottman's1401\\nresearch that it wasn't that1404\\npeople who were really good at being in1407\\na marriage1408\\num only thought about really big things1412\\nit turns out they would immediately1414\\nbreed bring up stuff even when it's1416\\nreally tiny or small1417\\nthey would never let a small thing grow1419\\nto be a medium thing1421\\nand then eventually a big thing they1423\\nimmediately will talk about it's like oh1424\\nman1425\\nuh can you close your mouth while you're1427\\nchewing um real quick it's just like1429\\nkind of bothering me1431\\nright now and then do it in a way that's1432\\nsort of respectful and so1434\\nlike when you're with your co-founders1437\\nand1437\\nyou're in this really sensitive1438\\nrelationship and you're finding stuff1440\\nthat's being really troubling like1442\\nyou can communicate those needs really1443\\nquickly and you will prevent1445\\nthose small things from becoming big1446\\nthings1448\\nthe best way to start doing this is the1450\\npractice so1453\\nat yc we call these level three1455\\nconversations so level one1457\\nis that informal conversation we have1459\\nother people where it's just like1460\\ndata exchange passing information back1462\\nand forth1463\\nlevel two conversations have some1465\\nemotions talk about some things that are1467\\npersonal1468\\nlevel three conversations1472\\nthey're relational they're engaged with1474\\nsomething that's happening right now1476\\nbetween two people that is super super1478\\nimportant1479\\nit is a deep dive into1483\\nwhat it might be really troubling or1485\\nwhat might be really mattering1487\\nto two people and in a startup there's a1489\\nlot of things that's going to matter1491\\nto all of the people working on the1492\\ncompany1494\\nso let's go through some examples of1496\\nthings that you guys can do1498\\nafter this talk1502\\nso goals some good ones are1505\\nwhat are our short-term goals for the1507\\ncompany1509\\nyou'd be surprised at how often people1511\\nare not on the same page1513\\nabout this are we using the right1516\\nmetrics1517\\nwe've got lectures on those the answer1519\\nis i hope so by now1521\\nand then are we uh1525\\nthat's supposed to be hitting our goals1526\\nnot hiring our goals are we hitting our1528\\ngoals1531\\nroles who's responsible for what's super1533\\nsensitive right1534\\nso is it clear who is responsible for1536\\nwhat1537\\nlike just have that conversation do we1540\\nagree1541\\nthat the current division makes the most1543\\nsense1545\\nand this might be super simple answers1547\\nbut if there is any kind of disagreement1548\\nwe want to hash that out1551\\nand performance okay so1554\\nis our workload distributed in an1556\\noptimal manner today1559\\ndo we all feel a high level of1562\\ndedication1563\\nand a motivation right now great thing1566\\nto just check on1567\\nevery day and then what mechanisms are1569\\nin place for providing feedback to one1571\\nanother1573\\nhave we carved out time for paying down1576\\nemotional debt1577\\ndo we feel like we can have these1580\\nlevel three conversations at any time do1582\\nwe have a process in place for thinking1584\\nthrough this stuff1585\\nso that we can be honest about where we1587\\nare1588\\nin our company going to sum things up1592\\nhow to work together everyone fights so1594\\nyou want to make a plan1596\\nyou need to figure out what's your1598\\nattachment style what's your roles1600\\nwhat's your goals and a process before1604\\nemotions get involved do it while you're1607\\nsober1608\\nuse non-violent communication to share1611\\nhonest feedback1612\\nwithout criticism1615\\n[Music]1616\\nand then pay down emotional debt on a1619\\nregular1620\\nbasis this is the most healthy way that1623\\nyou will make sure that things will not1625\\nturn1625\\ninto a giant blow up1628\\nyou can start having hard conversations1631\\nright now1632\\nthere's no doubt in my mind that there's1634\\nprobably some issue1636\\nthat the two of you or three of you or1638\\nfour of you or god forbid1640\\nseven of you are not talking about okay1643\\nthank you very much i'll let you guys1647\\n[Applause]1652\\nmingle1667\\nyou\""

    "How does caffeine keep us awake? - Hanan Qasim\n",
    "Over 100,000 metric tons\n",
    "of caffeine are consumed around the world every year. That's equivalent to the weight\n",
    "of 14 Eiffel Towers. Most of this caffeine is consumed\n",
    "in coffee and tea, but it's also ingested in some sodas, chocolate, caffeine pills, and even beverages labeled decaf. Caffeine helps us feel alert,\n",
    "focused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,\n",
    "and make us feel anxious. It's the world most widely used drug. So how does it keep us awake? Caffeine evolved in plants where\n",
    "it serves a few purposes. In high doses, as it's found in the leaves\n",
    "and seeds of certain species, it's toxic to insects. But when they consume it in lower doses,\n",
    "as it's found in nectar, it can actually help them remember\n",
    "and revisit flowers. In the human body, caffeine acts as a\n",
    "stimulant for the central nervous system. It keeps us awake by blocking one of\n",
    "the body's key sleep-inducing molecules, a substance called adenosine. Your body needs a constant supply\n",
    "of energy, which it gets by breaking down\n",
    "a high-energy molecule called ATP. In the process, it liberates adenosine,\n",
    "ATP's chemical backbone. Neurons in your brain have receptors\n",
    "perfectly tailored to this molecule. When adenosine docks to these receptors, it activates a cascade \n",
    "of biochemical reactions that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important\n",
    "brain-signaling molecules. In other words, you get sleepy. Caffeine is what's called an adenosine\n",
    "receptor antagonist. That means it derails this process\n",
    "of slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine and adenosine have a similar\n",
    "molecular structure, close enough that caffeine can wedge into\n",
    "the adenosine receptors, but not close enough to activate them. To summarize, \n",
    "adenosine inhibits your neurons. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,\n",
    "so it stimulates you. Caffeine can also boost positive feelings. In some neurons, the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors \n",
    "for another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain\n",
    "is to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these\n",
    "paired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine\n",
    "to fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,\n",
    "it doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects\n",
    "on adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too,\n",
    "reducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,\n",
    "and some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body's\n",
    "ability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes \n",
    "an unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below\n",
    "a certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine's effects\n",
    "are so helpful. It might make you feel better\n",
    "and more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate\n",
    "and blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages\n",
    "caffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body\n",
    "that have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular\n",
    "consumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors \n",
    "are perpetually clogged, your body will manufacture extra ones. That way, even with caffeine around, adenosine can still do its job\n",
    "of signaling the brain to power down. That's why you may find you need\n",
    "to consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert. There are more and more adenosine\n",
    "receptors to block. It's also why if you suddenly \n",
    "quit caffeine, you may experience \n",
    "an unpleasant withdrawal. With plenty of receptors \n",
    "and no competition, adenosine can work overtime, causing symptoms like headaches, tiredness, and depressed moods. But in a few days, the extra adenosine\n",
    "receptors will disappear, your body will readjust, and you'll feel just as alert as ever, even without an infusion of the world's\n",
    "most popular stimulant. \n",

    "The myth of Prometheus - Iseult Gillespie\n",
    "Before the creation of humanity, the Greek gods won a great battle against \n",
    "a race of giants called the Titans. Most Titans were destroyed or\n",
    "driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,\n",
    "whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus\n",
    "to fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating \n",
    "all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts\n",
    "of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability \n",
    "to move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped\n",
    "the first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods, but Zeus decreed \n",
    "they were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants \n",
    "of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient\n",
    "creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude\n",
    "creations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide\n",
    "how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick\n",
    "that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it\n",
    "into two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed \n",
    "the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones\n",
    "under a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly\n",
    "best portion for himself, he was outraged \n",
    "at Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use\n",
    "of fire on Earth, whether to cook meat \n",
    "or for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see\n",
    "his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus\n",
    "to steal fire from the workshop \n",
    "of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk\n",

    "# History of Bugs in Programs\n",
    "In the world of computers, a 'bug' is a fancy word for a mistake or problem in a program. Bugs make programs act in ways we didn't expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The First Bug?\n",
    "A long time ago, in 1947, a real-life moth (yes, the flying kind!) got stuck inside a computer. This caused the machine to go haywire. The engineers who found it joked that they \"debugged\" the computer by removing the moth. That's the archaic story how the term 'bug' came into the world of computing! But did it, really?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before computers looked like the machines we know today, people used the term 'bug' to describe glitches and hitches in electrical systems. Thomas Edison, the famous inventor, even mentioned \"bugs\" in his writings from the 1870s!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Expanding World of Bugs:\n",
    "As computers evolved, so did bugs. From simple mechanical glitches, bugs grew into complex software issues. They weren't just pesky problems but started influencing big events:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)**: A tiny bug in its software caused this European rocket to explode shortly after its launch. Ouch!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Y2K Bug**: As the world approached the year 2000, there was a global panic about computers not recognizing '00' as the year 2000 but as 1900. Thankfully, massive efforts debugged the potential mess!\n",

    "# First Karel Program\n",
    "Let's write your first Karel program, you know all the commands already. Imagine that Karel lives in the world below\n",
    "\n",
    "![World before](/images/intro-to-programming-js-en/4_first_program_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You job is to write program, where Karel will take the beeper on the (2,1) corner, will put it on the (4,2) corner and finish working on (5,2). After program execution world should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![World after](/images/intro-to-programming-js-en/4_first_program_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy enough with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "move\n",
    "pickBeeper\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "move\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "move\n",
    "move\n",
    "putBeeper\n",
    "move\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But, this is not a program yet. This is the instruction to solve the problem, but it's for humans to understand not for Karel. This is not a program this is an algorithm. Let's turn it to program. To do this we must turn all the commands into the **functions**. Basically **functions** are commands that could be executed. To do that we will just need to add `();` symbols at the end of all the commands. That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "move();\n",
    "pickBeeper();\n",
    "turnLeft();\n",
    "move();\n",

    "# `for` Loop in Karel\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases we need to repeat some Karel commands several times, We could copy and paste the commands, but it's way better to use the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally copy and pasting the code is not a good idea, we end up with the same code in different places. Which makes code changes tricky and error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume Karel is on the corner of the first street and first avenue - or coordinates (1,1). We want to pick a beeper that is on coordinates(100,1). Pretty straightforward right? We have to write a program with 99 `move();`s and a single `pickBeeper();` at the end. But copying `move();` that many times is quite time-taking and in the process we might miscount add an extra `move();` or miss one. The good news is we can use `for` loop and do it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < some_number; i++) {\n",
    "    Commands that we want to repeat\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loop consists of 2 parts the header and the body. The header defines number of iterations - or how many times you want to repeat something. And the body defines what you want to repeat - a set of instructions that will be repeated several times. Let's do not dwell on the exact meaning of the `for (let i = 0; i < some_number; i++)` the only thing interesting here is the `some_number` where you can write the actual number - how many times you want to repeat the instructions. And inside the `for` loop or in the body you can write the actual set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the program to solve our stated problem goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < 99; i++) {\n",
    "    move();\n",
    "}\n",
    "pickBeeper();\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you notices we used tab inside the `for` loop to make clearer for the code reader that `move();` part of the `for` loop's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Several instructions in `for`\n",
    "Of course we can put several instructions inside the `for` loop. In this case `for` loop executes these set of instructions one by one on each iterations. And the number of iterations is determined in the header of the loop. You can imagine that `for` loop just copies whatever it has inside and pastes it several times. So the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n",
    "    move();\n",
    "    turnLeft();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is exactly the same as the code:\n",

    "turnLeft();\n",
    "move();\n",
    "turnLeft();\n",

and then if you come. up with the idea together. and perhaps you fundraise together then. you\\'ll have collective ownership that. it\\'s your idea and it\\'s your company.versus a lot of times when you add. co-founders later. in their mind it\\'s your company. it\\'s not their company and even though. you know you worked on the company an. extra month than the other person did. which is so silly right you\\'ll always. have this like well this wasn\\'t my idea. this wasn\\'t my company.um which isn\\'t great from a retention. perspective if you can both really feel. like you shepherded the idea through the. earliest stages you\\'re going to see a. lot more ownership and people stepping. up when you go through hard times to. reiterate what we talked about at the. beginning. i don\\'t want to say co-founders are. essential. but man they\\'re so helpful it\\'s such a. powerful tool. especially in the hardest part of the. startup the pre-product market fit. startup we still encourage everyone to. have a co-founder. um but like the startup game right it\\'s. not about doing it well it\\'s about doing. it great like having a great co-founder. can be a super power for your company. having an okay co-founder not taking. this seriously.can be the seed of big problems.absolutely and sometimes people they end. up with co-founder issues i\\'m like well. i guess i\\'m just going to quit and start. a new company and we\\'ll well well it\\'s. so easy to start a new company and then. it\\'s like well good luck and then you. speak to them a year or two later and. it\\'s. really hard to get back to where they. were in the moment and one of the. regrets is they wish they would have. spent the time. to set up the co-founder relationship. well and choose the right person first. then think they can just. blow everything up and get a do-over. that\\'s just not how life works and so. the more you can front-load this the. first time around versus having hard. earned lessons. yeah
