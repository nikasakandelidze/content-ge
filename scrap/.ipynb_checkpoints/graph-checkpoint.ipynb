    "focused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,\n",

    "of energy, which it gets by breaking down\n",
    "a high-energy molecule called ATP. In the process, it liberates adenosine,\n",
    "ATP's chemical backbone. Neurons in your brain have receptors\n",
    "perfectly tailored to this molecule. When adenosine docks to these receptors, it activates a cascade \n",
    "of biochemical reactions that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important\n",
    "brain-signaling molecules. In other words, you get sleepy. Caffeine is what's called an adenosine\n",
    "receptor antagonist. That means it derails this process\n",
    "of slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine and adenosine have a similar\n",
    "molecular structure, close enough that caffeine can wedge into\n",
    "the adenosine receptors, but not close enough to activate them. To summarize, \n",
    "adenosine inhibits your neurons. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,\n",
    "so it stimulates you. Caffeine can also boost positive feelings. In some neurons, the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors \n",
    "for another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain\n",
    "is to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these\n",
    "paired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine\n",
    "to fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,\n",
    "it doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects\n",
    "on adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too,\n",
    "reducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,\n",
    "and some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body's\n",
    "ability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes \n",
    "an unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below\n",
    "a certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine's effects\n",
    "are so helpful. It might make you feel better\n",
    "and more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate\n",
    "and blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages\n",
    "caffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body\n",
    "that have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular\n",
    "consumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors \n",
    "are perpetually clogged, your body will manufacture extra ones. That way, even with caffeine around, adenosine can still do its job\n",
    "of signaling the brain to power down. That's why you may find you need\n",
    "to consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert. There are more and more adenosine\n",
    "receptors to block. It's also why if you suddenly \n",
    "quit caffeine, you may experience \n",
    "an unpleasant withdrawal. With plenty of receptors \n",
    "and no competition, adenosine can work overtime, causing symptoms like headaches, tiredness, and depressed moods. But in a few days, the extra adenosine\n",
    "receptors will disappear, your body will readjust, and you'll feel just as alert as ever, even without an infusion of the world's\n",
    "most popular stimulant. \n",

    "Topic B:\n",
    "The myth of Prometheus - Iseult Gillespie\n",
    "Before the creation of humanity, the Greek gods won a great battle against \n",
    "a race of giants called the Titans. Most Titans were destroyed or\n",
    "driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,\n",
    "whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus\n",
    "to fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating \n",
    "all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts\n",
    "of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability \n",
    "to move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped\n",
    "the first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods, but Zeus decreed \n",
    "they were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants \n",
    "of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient\n",
    "creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude\n",
    "creations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide\n",
    "how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick\n",
    "that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it\n",
    "into two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed \n",
    "the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones\n",
    "under a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly\n",
    "best portion for himself, he was outraged \n",
    "at Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use\n",
    "of fire on Earth, whether to cook meat \n",
    "or for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see\n",
    "his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus\n",
    "to steal fire from the workshop \n",
    "of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk\n",
    "and brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness\n",
    "nature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care \n",
    "for themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons\n",
    "and wage war. Prometheus's flames acted as a catalyst\n",
    "for the rapid progression of civilization. When Zeus looked down at this scene,\n",
    "he realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again\n",
    "wounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, Zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained\n",
    "to a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture\n",
    "who would tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back\n",
    "to be attacked again in the morning. Although Prometheus remained \n",
    "in perpetual agony, he never expressed regret \n",
    "at his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression\n",
    "made him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous\n",
    "and inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress,\n",
    "and power he brought to human hands. He's also a recurring figure\n",
    "in art and literature. In Percy Bysshe Shelley's\n",
    "lyrical drama \"Prometheus Unbound,\" the author imagines Prometheus\n",
    "as a romantic hero who escapes and continues to spread\n",
    "empathy and knowledge. Of his protagonist, Shelley wrote, \"Prometheus is the type \n",
    "of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest \n",
    "and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends.\" His wife Mary envisaged Prometheus\n",
    "as a more cautionary figure and subtitled her novel\n",
    "\"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus.\" This suggests the damage of corrupting\n",
    "the natural order and remains relevant \n",
    "to the ethical questions surrounding science and technology today. As hero, rebel, or trickster, Prometheus remains a symbol of our\n",
    "capacity to capture the powers of nature, and ultimately, he reminds us of the potential \n",

    "\n",
    "## The First Bug?\n",
    "A long time ago, in 1947, a real-life moth (yes, the flying kind!) got stuck inside a computer. This caused the machine to go haywire. The engineers who found it joked that they \"debugged\" the computer by removing the moth. That's the archaic story how the term 'bug' came into the world of computing! But did it, really?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before computers looked like the machines we know today, people used the term 'bug' to describe glitches and hitches in electrical systems. Thomas Edison, the famous inventor, even mentioned \"bugs\" in his writings from the 1870s!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Expanding World of Bugs:\n",
    "As computers evolved, so did bugs. From simple mechanical glitches, bugs grew into complex software issues. They weren't just pesky problems but started influencing big events:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)**: A tiny bug in its software caused this European rocket to explode shortly after its launch. Ouch!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Y2K Bug**: As the world approached the year 2000, there was a global panic about computers not recognizing '00' as the year 2000 but as 1900. Thankfully, massive efforts debugged the potential mess!\n",

    "# First Karel Program\n",
    "Let's write your first Karel program, you know all the commands already. Imagine that Karel lives in the world below\n",
    "\n",
    "![World before](/images/intro-to-programming-js-en/4_first_program_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You job is to write program, where Karel will take the beeper on the (2,1) corner, will put it on the (4,2) corner and finish working on (5,2). After program execution world should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![World after](/images/intro-to-programming-js-en/4_first_program_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy enough with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "move\n",
    "pickBeeper\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "move\n",

    "move\n",
    "move\n",
    "putBeeper\n",
    "move\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But, this is not a program yet. This is the instruction to solve the problem, but it's for humans to understand not for Karel. This is not a program this is an algorithm. Let's turn it to program. To do this we must turn all the commands into the **functions**. Basically **functions** are commands that could be executed. To do that we will just need to add `();` symbols at the end of all the commands. That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So we get:\n",

    "# `for` Loop in Karel\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases we need to repeat some Karel commands several times, We could copy and paste the commands, but it's way better to use the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally copy and pasting the code is not a good idea, we end up with the same code in different places. Which makes code changes tricky and error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume Karel is on the corner of the first street and first avenue - or coordinates (1,1). We want to pick a beeper that is on coordinates(100,1). Pretty straightforward right? We have to write a program with 99 `move();`s and a single `pickBeeper();` at the end. But copying `move();` that many times is quite time-taking and in the process we might miscount add an extra `move();` or miss one. The good news is we can use `for` loop and do it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < some_number; i++) {\n",
    "    Commands that we want to repeat\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loop consists of 2 parts the header and the body. The header defines number of iterations - or how many times you want to repeat something. And the body defines what you want to repeat - a set of instructions that will be repeated several times. Let's do not dwell on the exact meaning of the `for (let i = 0; i < some_number; i++)` the only thing interesting here is the `some_number` where you can write the actual number - how many times you want to repeat the instructions. And inside the `for` loop or in the body you can write the actual set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the program to solve our stated problem goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < 99; i++) {\n",
    "    move();\n",
    "}\n",
    "pickBeeper();\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you notices we used tab inside the `for` loop to make clearer for the code reader that `move();` part of the `for` loop's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Several instructions in `for`\n",
    "Of course we can put several instructions inside the `for` loop. In this case `for` loop executes these set of instructions one by one on each iterations. And the number of iterations is determined in the header of the loop. You can imagine that `for` loop just copies whatever it has inside and pastes it several times. So the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n",
    "    move();\n",
    "    turnLeft();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
