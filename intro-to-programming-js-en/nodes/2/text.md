## Understanding the Grid

* **Streets & Avenues**: Karel's World is structured like a grid. Imagine a chessboard: the horizontal lines are known as streets, and the vertical counterparts are avenues. Each intersection or corner on this grid is a potential spot where Karel can stand.
* **Walls**: While navigating, Karel sometimes encounters walls. These obstacles are fixed, and Karel cannot pass through them, making them essential components of many challenges.
* **Beepers**: These are small tokens found in Karel's World. Karel can pick up or put down beepers. Often, they form the objectives of many tasks and missions Karel undertakes.

## Navigating the Landscape
In this world, Karel responds to commands, allowing it to move from one grid spot to another, interact with beepers, and orient itself in different directions. The design of Karel's World emphasizes logic and strategy, making every task a unique puzzle waiting to be solved.

There can be many different worlds with different sizes, with beepers and walls in different places
