We call tabs, spaces, newline characters - Whitespace and they make no difference in your code execution. For example Karel does exactly the same if we do this. This is still the same for Karel, it does not care. You are free to format and indent your programs anyway you like. 

The only difference is readability. It's a good practice to have a consistent style and use it in your program.

We will be indenting everything inside the function to make clear that this is the function implementation. Just to make our code easier to read and understand.
