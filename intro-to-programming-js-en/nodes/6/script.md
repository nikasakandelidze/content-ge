Let's revisit our First Karel Program. 
If you remember Karel takes beeper from (2,1) corner, puts it here and ends up working on this corner.
And here we have the code that does the job. 

Let's run! wow cool!

Let's run it once again! uuuh! Karel did no move, and we have some wired looking message here. 

It's a bug! What happened? Even though we ran the same program once again the world changes,
Karel is no longer on the (1,1) corner, and there is a wall in front of Karel.

First command Karel executes is move and it ran into a wall. So we get the message front is blocked

You should be aware and run the program for the correct world!

If we reset the world we can run it again with no problem.
