Karel has some detective skills!
That's right! Karel can check out its surroundings and make decisions based on what it finds. Let's check out some conditions it can find out about the world it lives in. 

* frontIsClear. This lets Karel check if the coast is clear ahead. No walls blocking its way!
* frontIsBlocked. It's testing if there's a wall ahead. And telling Karel to move() into a wall? Big no-no!

Looking right, We have rightIsClear and rightIsBlocked. To the left? You guessed it! leftIsClear and leftIsBlocked. Karel can quickly figure out if there are walls on either side. Handy, huh?

Also, Karel can test if there is a beeper on the corner where Karel stands.

Condition names should be used with uppercase and lowercase characters precisely as written.
