# Why Do We Need New Functions

Why do we bother teaching Karel new functions like `turnRight`?

## Avoiding Repetition
Imagine telling Karel to turn left three times every time we want it to turn right. That’s a lot of talking, and honestly, who has the energy? By teaching Karel the `turnRight` function, we save time and make our code cleaner and easier to read. When we create new functions, we don’t have to write the same lines of code over and over again.

## Simplicity is Key
New functions make our instructions to Karel simple and straightforward. Instead of shouting a long list of commands, we can just say one word (or function), and Karel knows exactly what to do. 

## Less Errors
With functions if we want to change their behavior we do this in the single place. Without function we have to change same thing in different places and we might create bugs if we forget to change in some places.


So, new functions are our little helpers in making programming with Karel smooth, easy, and fun.
