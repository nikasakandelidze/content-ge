Let's talk about the while loop in Karel and how it's sometimes used incorrectly. It's fundamental to recognize that if the condition of the while loop is true, Karel will dutifully execute all the instructions inside the loop's body. Now, here's where things get tricky. Even if, during the execution of those instructions, the condition becomes false, it won't immediately halt the loop. The loop checks the condition only at the start of each iteration, and not in the middle.

Consider this piece of code:

while (frontIsClear()) {
    move();
    move();
}

At first glance, one might think, 'Ah, this loop will end as soon as Karel encounters a wall.' But that's not true at all.
Let's check how things unfold:

1. Karel checks if there's a clear path ahead.
2. Finding no obstruction, Karel moves forward.
3. Karel then moves forward again, as instructed, landing on coordinates (3,1), completing the first iteration of the while loop.
4. Next, Karel once again checks the path ahead.
5. Still clear! So, Karel makes another move, reaching (4,1).
6. The code tells Karel to move again. But wait! There's a wall ahead, and Karel can't proceed.

And there you have it, a bug in our program.
