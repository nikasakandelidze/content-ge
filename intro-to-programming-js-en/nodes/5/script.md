Ever wondered where the term 'bug' in computer lingo started?
There's a story - 1947. Harvard. A moth dives into a computer. Computer glitched. Computers back then where big enough to go inside, so engineers went, found the bug and coined the term 'bug' and 'debugging'. 
Thats just a story, in fact bugs existed even before that!

In the 1870s, the legendary Thomas Edison mentioned 'bugs' in his notes about electrical systems.

As computers grew, bugs became trickier. From simple glitches to ones causing rockets to explode!

One of the most popular bug is the Y2K bug. The millennium scare! Would computers think it's 1900 again.

With every bug, there's a hero. Debuggers! The tech warriors who ensure our digital world runs smoothly.
