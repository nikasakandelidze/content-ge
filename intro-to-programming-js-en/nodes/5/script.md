Ever wondered where the term 'bug' in computer lingo started?
There's a story - 1947 in Harvard, there was a computer named MARC 2. One day it glitched. 
At that time computers where big enough to go inside, so engineers went, found a moth stuck in a relay, 
so they coined the term 'bug' as an error in computer or in computer program, 
and 'debugging' as finding bugs and getting rid of them. 

That exact bug is somewhere in museum now, and person who found the bug was named Grace Hopper.

Actually term bugs existed even before that!

In the 1870s, the legendary Thomas Edison mentioned 'bugs' in his notes about electrical systems.

As computers grew, bugs became trickier. From simple glitches to ones causing rockets to explode!

One of the most popular bug is the Y2K bug. As the world approached the year 2000, 
there was a global panic about computers not recognizing '00' as the year 2000 but as 1900. 

Thankfully, massive efforts debugged the potential mess!
