# History of Bugs in Programs
In the world of computers, a 'bug' is a fancy word for a mistake or problem in a program. Bugs make programs act in ways we didn't expect.

## The First Bug?
A long time ago, in 1947, a real-life moth (yes, the flying kind!) got stuck inside a computer. This caused the machine to go haywire. The engineers who found it joked that they "debugged" the computer by removing the moth. That's the archaic story how the term 'bug' came into the world of computing! But did it, really?

Even before computers looked like the machines we know today, people used the term 'bug' to describe glitches and hitches in electrical systems. Thomas Edison, the famous inventor, even mentioned "bugs" in his writings from the 1870s!

## The Expanding World of Bugs:
As computers evolved, so did bugs. From simple mechanical glitches, bugs grew into complex software issues. They weren't just pesky problems but started influencing big events:

1. **The Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)**: A tiny bug in its software caused this European rocket to explode shortly after its launch. Ouch!

2. **The Y2K Bug**: As the world approached the year 2000, there was a global panic about computers not recognizing '00' as the year 2000 but as 1900. Thankfully, massive efforts debugged the potential mess!
