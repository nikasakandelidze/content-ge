This is Karel The Robot. 
Back in the 1970s, at Stanford University, Richard Pattis had a brilliant idea. Why not make learning programming fun?
Instead of diving into concrete programming language syntax complexities, why not start with something simpler?
So, Enter Karel, a robot living in a grid world, understanding simple commands and teaching you the art of problem-solving.
With Karel, it's not about the programming language. It's about logic, strategy, and having a blast while doing it!

Karel lives in a grid world, where streets run horizontally - this way, avenues run vertically - that way. The grid is surrounded with walls Karel can't pass, you can see walls inside the world as well.

And then, there are beepers. Karel's little treasures. Collecting them is part of the fun.

The world can have different size, with beepers and walls in different places, Karel in different corner, facing east, west, north or south. But that's it. 

This is Karel and Karel's world
