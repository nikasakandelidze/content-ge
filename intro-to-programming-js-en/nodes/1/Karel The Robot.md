## Origin Story
Karel was brought to life by Richard Pattis in the 1970s at Stanford University. But why? Well, Pattis believed in learning programming through problem-solving and logic, rather than memorizing tricky syntax. Thus, Karel was designed to be a fun, interactive way to introduce beginners to the world of coding.


## Why Karel?
* **Simplicity**: Karel understands a limited set of commands, making it easy for beginners to get started.
* **Conceptual Learning**: Karel emphasizes programming logic over syntax. It's all about problem-solving!
* **Engagement**: Karel's world is visual, interactive and fun.

## Karel's World
Imagine a vast checkerboard; this is where Karel resides. This grid is made up of:

* **Streets & Avenues**: Streets run horizontally, while avenues stretch vertically. These form the pathways for Karel's adventures. Each intersection or corner on this grid is a potential spot where Karel can stand.
* **Walls**: While navigating, Karel sometimes encounters walls. These obstacles are fixed, and Karel cannot pass through them, making them essential components of many challenges.
* **Beepers**: These are Karel's collectibles. Shiny tokens that can be picked up or placed down. Often, they form the objectives of many tasks and missions Karel undertakes.

There can be many different worlds with different sizes, with beepers and walls in different places

## Navigating the Landscape
In this world, Karel responds to commands, allowing it to move from one grid spot to another, interact with beepers, and orient itself in different directions. The design of Karel's World emphasizes logic and strategy, making every task a unique puzzle waiting to be solved.
