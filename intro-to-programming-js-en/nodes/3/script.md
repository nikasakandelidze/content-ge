An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions, that is understandable for humans, and gets something done. It's like a roadmap that tells you exactly how to go from problem to solution. Basically a recipe, but for solving problems, not just for cooking.

For example if you are tying your shoes chances are you are using an algorithm - "bunny rabbit" or "loop, swoop and pull". In fact any task you perform has some kind of algorithm underneath it you might not even think about.

So, the next time you're faced with a puzzle or a tricky task, just think: "What's my algorithm for this?"
