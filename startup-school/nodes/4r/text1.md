## Strategies for Coming Up with Startup Ideas: Spotting Opportunities in Recent Changes

A good way to come up with startup ideas is to look at what's changed in the world lately and see if these changes have opened up new opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example of a big change that led to new startup ideas. It altered how we all live, work, and interact, which meant there was a need for new kinds of services and products.

One success story from this time is a company called Gather Town. They've created a fun, online space for people to hang out. Before the pandemic, the founders of Gather Town were working on a different idea that wasn't doing too well. But when COVID-19 hit and changed how we socialize, they quickly switched to this new idea. They saw that the pandemic made people want new ways to connect online, and they built something to meet that need.

So, when you're thinking of startup ideas, pay attention to big changes happening around you. These changes can be anything â€“ new technologies, shifts in how people live, or even global events like a pandemic. These situations can create needs that weren't there before, and that's where you can find opportunities for new startups.
