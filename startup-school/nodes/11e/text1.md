## Planning for Co-founder Disagreements: Understanding Each Other's Attachment Style

When working with others, especially someone like a business partner, it's really important to know not only yourself but also them. This can help avoid misunderstandings.

There's some good research from the 1960s that said people have different ways of handling relationships. There are mainly three types. 

First, there's a group of people who are happy making friends, relying on others, and letting others rely on them. They're okay with sharing feelings and don't mind when others do the same. This is called a 'secure' style.

Second, there are those who feel they don't get enough love and want to hold on to people. They need others to always confirm they love them or want to be with them. This is the 'anxious' style.

Third, there are people who find making friends tough. Sometimes they just want to run away because it's scary, or they're worried about messing up. This is the 'avoidant' style.

Knowing your business partner's style and your own can help you understand and fix any issues that come up. Funny enough, most people are either anxious or avoidant, and these two types usually end up together. This means one person needs space to think things through, while the other needs to be reassured all the time.

If you don't understand what the other person needs, you'll have trouble working together. You both will need to make some changes to make it work. There are many good books and a nice webpage on Wikipedia about these styles. There's also a helpful video on YouTube by School of Life that talks about this. 

Basically, if you're with someone who is the opposite type, you have to do some extra work. If you're an anxious type and the other person is an avoidant type, understand that they need space. It doesn't mean they're leaving forever. If you're an avoidant type with an anxious type, let them know if you need space. Just say something like, "I need a bit of time to think about this. We'll talk about it soon." And be sure to come back when you said you would.
