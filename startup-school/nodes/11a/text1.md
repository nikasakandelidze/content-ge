## What Is Your Attachment Style?
Back in 1985, a simple quiz in a Colorado newspaper started by two psychologists, Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver, offered a new way to think about love. They asked people to pick one statement that best described their feelings in relationships:

A: Getting close to others is easy for me. I’m okay with relying on them and them relying on me. I don’t worry about being left or someone getting too close.
B: I wish people would get closer to me. I often worry my partner doesn’t truly love me or will leave me. I try to get very close, which might scare some people away.
C: Being close to others makes me uncomfortable. Trusting people fully is hard for me. I get nervous when someone gets too close, and sometimes people want more closeness than I’m okay with.

These choices are about different ways we connect with people we love, a concept first brought up by John Bowlby, who created Attachment Theory. Option A means you're pretty secure in how you love, finding it easy to trust and be close. Option B shows an anxious style, where you crave closeness but are scared of getting hurt, which might lead to rocky relationships. Option C points to an avoidant style, preferring to keep to yourself and feeling uneasy about getting too close to others.

Even though it might seem a bit strange to take relationship advice from a newspaper quiz, this one really hits the mark. Understanding whether you're more secure, anxious, or avoidant in love can help you avoid falling into familiar traps in your relationships. Many of us aren't in the secure camp; we lean more towards being avoidant or anxious, and we often find ourselves drawn to someone who's our opposite, making things even more complicated.

Here are a few tips for those who tend to keep their distance (avoidants) or those who always seek more closeness (anxious types) in their relationships:

### If You Tend to Keep Distance:

* Notice when you start pulling away, especially when someone offers closeness.
* Be aware of your tendency to prefer fleeting connections and to shy away from deeper signs of affection.
* Recognize your patterns of avoiding long-term intimacy and understand it's often because you've been let down before.
* Realize that the past doesn't have to dictate the present. Don't let old fears ruin what you have now.
* Understand that behind your partner's complaints is a deep desire for connection. Look past the surface and see their true intentions.
* Do something scary but necessary: offer reassurance and share why sometimes you feel the need to retreat.

### If You're the One Seeking More Closeness:

* Things might not be as bad as they seem. Your partner's silence isn't always a sign of indifference.
* Understand that your direct approach to intimacy, especially if it comes with frustration, can push your partner further away.
* Realize you're not 'needy' for wanting more, but how you ask for it can make things worse.
* Learn to ask for closeness in a gentler, less confrontational way.

Understanding whether you're secure, avoidant, or anxious in love is crucial. And if you're not secure, that's okay. Many of us need a bit of help to break out of our usual patterns and have a chance at a fulfilling relationship. It's about knowing yourself, recognizing the need for growth, and gently guiding each other toward a deeper connection.
