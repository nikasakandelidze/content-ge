## Choosing a Startup Idea You Can Commit to Long-Term

When picking a startup idea, ask yourself: Is this something I want to work on for many years? This question is important, but the answer can be tricky. Sometimes you might not be super excited about an idea at first, but it can grow on you as it starts to succeed.

A lot of successful startups are in areas that might seem dull, like software for taxes or accounting. Most people don't start out excited about these topics. But these areas can make for really good businesses. And the interesting thing is, once you start running a successful business, even in a "boring" area, you often start to enjoy it more and more.

So, when you're thinking about a startup idea, it's not just about whether you love the idea right now. It's also about whether it's something you can see yourself getting more into as you work on it and as it begins to do well.
