## Handling Co-Founder Conflicts

When it comes to running a startup with someone else, it's crucial to take any arguments with your co-founder seriously. These disagreements can be more harmful to your business than almost anything else. Often, co-founder disputes arise because the relationship hasn't been truly tested under pressure. You might get along great as friends or casual colleagues, but when a real disagreement hits, it can blow up if you're not prepared.

One key thing to remember is that it's okay not to resolve every argument right away. If both of you aren't in the right mindset to have a productive discussion, it's better to pause and come back to the issue later. Continuing to argue in the heat of the moment often does more harm than good.

Another important point is understanding how each of you handles stress. People react differently â€“ some might confront issues head-on (attacking), while others might need time to process things on their own (retreating). Knowing your co-founder's stress response can help you interpret their actions better during tense moments.

In my view, having a co-founder you've known for a while, someone you've already had ups and downs with can be more beneficial than teaming up with someone new. That history can provide a foundation of understanding and resilience, which is vital for navigating the challenging journey of a startup.
