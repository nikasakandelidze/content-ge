## Three Surprising Qualities of Potentially Successful Startup Ideas

When you're thinking about startup ideas, there are three things that might seem bad at first but can actually be signs of a great opportunity. These are ideas that are hard to start, ideas in a boring field, and ideas with existing competition. Here's why these can be good:

1. **Ideas That Are Hard to Start**: Sometimes, the best ideas are the ones that seem really tough to get going. Take Stripe, the company that made it easy to handle credit card payments online. Before Stripe, lots of developers knew it was hard to integrate payments, but nobody tried to fix it because it seemed too tough. The challenge scared people away, leaving a huge opportunity open for the Stripe founders.

2. **Ideas in a Boring Space**: Boring ideas, like payroll software, often get overlooked. That's what happened with Gusto. People knew the existing payroll software wasn't great, but nobody wanted to tackle it because it didn't sound exciting. However, boring ideas can be gold mines because not many people are working on them. And here's the thing: running a startup, whether it's a 'fun' idea or a 'boring' one, often involves similar day-to-day work like coding and talking to users. So, the idea's initial excitement might not matter as much as you think.

3. **Ideas with Existing Competition**: Good startup ideas often have competitors already. When there's no competition, it might mean there's no demand. A great situation is when there are competitors, but they're all missing something important. Dropbox is a perfect example. There were about 20 cloud storage services when Dropbox started. But Dropbox succeeded because it noticed something the others missed: their user interfaces were bad. Dropbox made a simple, integrated solution that worked better.


In short, don't be put off if your idea seems tough to start, or unexciting, or if there are already companies doing something similar. These factors can actually be signs that you're onto something really good.
