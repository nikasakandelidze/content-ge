## Planning for Co-founder disagreements: Document the Process

There may come a time when we need to sort out our ideas, and having a written process to do so will help. It'll keep things fair and safe. It's good to set up these rules when everyone is calm and clear-headed. Why? Because when we're mad or emotional, we might not think straight. We may say things we don't mean, and that can lead to bigger problems.

A good example can be seen with a company called Mater. They prepared a simple list of how to handle disagreements. It's a clear guide on what to do when we have different views. It lists different choices, who made the final call, what the decision was, when it was made, and why. When the guide is ready, we don't need to worry when disagreements come up. We just need to fill out this list and it will steer us in the right direction.

There are many ways to do this, and you don't need to copy Mater's exact method. Maybe you decide that if there's a strong disagreement, you'll toss a coin to make the decision. The main thing is that the rules are set up beforehand. So, when you're upset, you can just say, "Alright, we have a plan for this," and follow your process. It might suggest taking a short break, eating a sandwich, or even taking a nap before coming back to talk things over. It's all about finding a way that makes sense for everyone involved.
