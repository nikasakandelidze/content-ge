## Choosing a Co-Founder: Skills vs. Compatibility

When it comes to picking a co-founder, I believe a common mistake founders make is focusing too much on finding someone with the right skills rather than someone they can actually get along with, like a friend. Many founders think that the skills their co-founder has at the start are the only ones they'll ever have. However, in reality, most skills are learned while doing the job. It's often better to team up with someone you really like and learn together, rather than partnering with a stranger and facing conflicts.

To give you an idea of how important this is, think about how many founder breakups occur not because a co-founder lacks certain skills, but because they simply can't get along. It's rare to hear a founder say, "My co-founder was a great person, and we got along well, but they just didnâ€™t have the right skills." More often, the issue is that working together is a nightmare, and that's what leads to breakups. While not having the right skills might be a problem, it usually isn't a deal-breaker for a startup. The real key to a successful partnership is finding someone you can work with effectively, even through the tough times.
