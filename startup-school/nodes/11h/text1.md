## Paying down Emotional Debt Regularly

Sometimes when making a program, we have to take shortcuts to get things done faster. But we know that these quick fixes might cause problems later on. This is called "technical debt." Just like with programming, we can also have "emotional debt" in our relationships. That's when we ignore small issues, which can later become big problems. It's best to fix these issues as soon as they come up.

This is also true in marriages, according to research by a person named John Gottman. He observed that couples who are happy deal with issues straight away, even if they're small. They never let a problem get bigger by ignoring it. For example, they might say, "Could you please close your mouth while you're eating? It's disturbing me a bit." They deal with issues quickly and kindly. 

This is similar to running a business with a partner. If something is bothering you, it's better to talk about it as soon as it comes up. That way, small issues won't turn into big ones. 

Now, how do you start doing this? You need to practice. There's a group called YC that talks about three levels of conversations. Level one is simple chats where you exchange facts. Level two involves sharing feelings about things. Level three is about the relationship between two people. At this level, you talk about what's going on right now and why it's important. 

Doing a startup involves a lot of these level-three talks. That's because many important things need to be discussed within a team.

Here are a few topics that are good to discuss: Short-term goals, metrics you're using and whether you're meeting your goals. 

It's important to make sure everyone knows who's in charge of what. If there's any disagreement, it's good to talk about it and sort it out. 

You also need to check whether the work is divided in the best way between the team members. Everyone needs to be dedicated and motivated. 

Lastly, you also need to discuss how you'll provide feedback to each other and work out any emotional debt. You need a system to deal with these issues in an honest manner. 

So to wrap things up, it's important to have regular talks about how things are going in your startup. Clear communication helps prevent small problems from becoming big issues.
