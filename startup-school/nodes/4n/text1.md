## Strategies for Coming Up with Startup Ideas: What Your Team Good at

The best method is to start with what you and your team are really good at. Think of ideas that use your special skills. This way, any idea you think of will fit well with what you know and can do – it's like a shortcut to finding ideas that match your team's strengths.

For example, take Rezi, a company kind of like Opendoor but for rental apartments. Before starting Rezi, the founders had a lot of experience in real estate and financing. When they joined Y Combinator, they spent the first month just looking for ideas. But they were smart – they only looked at ideas related to real estate and financial technology because they knew a lot about these areas. This field is rich with opportunities for startups, and their expertise helped them quickly find a great idea for Rezi.

If you're an expert in something, like the Rezi founders, you should definitely start by thinking of ideas in your field. It's surprising how many people apply to Y Combinator with ideas that have nothing to do with what they're experts in.

However, if you're younger or still in college, you might not have this kind of expertise yet. If that's you, this approach might not be the best fit. Instead, you might need to explore different ways to come up with ideas that match your current skills and experiences.
