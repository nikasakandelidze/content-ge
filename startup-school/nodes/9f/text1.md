## More Tips for Finding the Right Co-Founder

When you're at the very start of your journey to create a company, choosing a co-founder is one of the most important steps. I often hear from people who want to come up with a business idea first, or maybe even raise money, and then look for a co-founder. But this approach can lead to problems.

Here are some practical tips for finding a co-founder:

1. **Find Your Co-Founder First**: It's better to figure out who your co-founder is before you finalize your idea or try to raise funds. If you develop the idea together and fundraise as a team, you both feel a sense of collective ownership. It becomes 'our' company, not just 'your' company.
2. **Shared Ownership and Involvement**: Adding a co-founder later often leads to them feeling like it's not really their company or idea. This can affect their commitment and motivation, especially during tough times. If both of you are involved from the earliest stages, there's a stronger sense of ownership and responsibility.
3. **Co-Founders Are Invaluable**: While not absolutely essential, having a co-founder can be a huge advantage, particularly in the early, challenging stages of a startup before you achieve product-market fit. A great co-founder can be a superpower for your company, but an average one, or not taking the process seriously, can create big problems.
4. **Invest in the Relationship Early**: Don't take shortcuts in establishing your co-founder relationship. It's much harder to 'start over' with a new company than it is to invest time in getting the relationship right the first time. Those who skip this step often regret it later.
5. **Don't Slack Off**: Choosing a co-founder isn't a task where you can afford to put in half the effort. It's one of the most critical decisions you'll make at the start of your company.


In summary, prioritize finding a co-founder and make sure to do it properly. Investing in this relationship early on sets a strong foundation for your startup and prepares you to face inevitable challenges together. Remember, a co-founder isn't just a teammate; they're a key part of your startup's success.
