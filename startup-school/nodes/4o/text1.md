## Strategies for Coming Up with Startup Ideas: Starting from Personal Experience

Another good way to come up with startup ideas is to think about problems you've faced yourself, especially ones that you're in a unique position to notice. VetCove is a great example of this. It's a website where veterinarians can order supplies, sort of like Amazon but for vets.

Here's the story behind VetCove: the founders are brothers, and their dad was a veterinarian. Growing up, they saw how their dad ordered supplies in a really outdated way, like calling suppliers on the phone. It was clear to them that there could be a simpler, online solution, just like Amazon, for this process.

What makes VetCove a fantastic example is that many veterinarians probably recognized this problem but didnâ€™t have the tech background to start a tech company. Meanwhile, loads of tech people in places like Silicon Valley were working on less impactful ideas, not realizing that a great opportunity was out there in the vet world. When the VetCove founders began, they didn't have much competition, leaving this brilliant idea unexplored for years.

So, when you're thinking of a startup, consider the problems you've seen in your life, particularly those that you have a unique insight into. These can be the source of really good, practical startup ideas.
