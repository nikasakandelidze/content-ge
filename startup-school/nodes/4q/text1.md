## Strategies for Coming Up with Startup Ideas: Creating What You Wish Existed

Another approach to finding startup ideas is simply to think about things you wish existed. This method is a classic and commonly advised. A famous example of this is DoorDash. The founders were Stanford undergrads who really wanted an easy way to get food from local restaurants delivered to their dorm. Before DoorDash, this service wasn't available, so they created it themselves.

This approach can be really effective because it's based on your own desires and needs, which means you're likely to be passionate about it. However, there's a catch. Sometimes, the ideas you personally wish for might lead to those tricky 'tar pit' ideas I mentioned before. So, if you're thinking of an idea based on what you wish existed, it's important to stop and ask yourself: Is there a reason this doesn't already exist?

This pause for thought can help you figure out whether the idea is really viable or if there might be hidden challenges you haven't considered yet. It's a way to make sure your idea has a real chance of succeeding and isn't just something that sounds good but won't work in reality.
