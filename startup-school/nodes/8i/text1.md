## Essential Discussions Before Partnering with a Co-Founder

Before committing to a co-founder relationship, it’s crucial to have open discussions on several key topics. These conversations can prevent future misunderstandings and ensure both parties are on the same page. Here are some vital topics to cover:

* **Work Commitment**: Discuss how much time each of you plans to dedicate to the startup. This includes evenings, weekends, and vacations. Assumptions can vary widely, so it’s important to clarify expectations.
* **Communication and Availability**: Define what being available means to each of you. How quickly do you expect responses to messages or emails? Understanding each other's communication styles is essential to avoid frustration.
* **Financial Expectations**: Discuss how long each of you can go without a salary or benefits. This is a crucial aspect of startup life and can significantly impact your stress levels and decision-making.
* **Milestones and Motivation**: Talk about what each of you needs to see at different milestones to stay motivated. Does anyone have a specific timeline in mind for when the startup needs to show significant progress? If so, clarify what 'progress' or 'working' means to each of you.

Having these discussions upfront is invaluable. Misalignments in these areas might start as minor issues but can grow into major points of contention. By addressing them early, you can build a strong foundation for your co-founder relationship.
