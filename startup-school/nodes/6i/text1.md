## The Pivot Story of Retool (YC W17)

Retool's journey is an inspiring example of a successful pivot. They were part of Winter 17 at YC and are now a fantastic SaaS (Software as a Service) company. Retool offers a tool for building internal tools, which I highly recommend to startups for creating their management pages. It's genuinely a great product and worth checking out.

Before their pivot, Retool was trying to be a Venmo-like service for the UK. The idea had potential; Venmo is big, so it seemed promising. But in terms of founder/market fit, they were at a 3 out of 10. They didn't have much FinTech experience, but they managed to launch and get users, which was impressive. However, the ease of getting started was higher, around 7 out of 10, because they had already launched and gained some traction.

The tricky part was the early market feedback, only 3 out of 10. They struggled with getting people to pay, and they were losing money on each transaction. Despite having users, the financials weren't working out, making it a difficult but necessary decision to pivot.

Post-pivot, Retool became a no-code tool for building internal tools. This idea scores a 10 out of 10 for me. A huge portion of the software is built for internal use in big companies, indicating a large market potential. The founder/market fit improved drastically to 10 out of 10. One of the founders had experience creating something similar during a college internship, giving them a clear vision for the product.

They built the new version of Retool in just two weeks and quickly found their first customers, indicating ease of getting started. The early market feedback was moderate, about 5 out of 10. People were interested but hesitant to trust a new startup for such crucial tools. It wasnâ€™t an immediate hit, but they gained users gradually, demonstrating that the pivot was a smart move.
