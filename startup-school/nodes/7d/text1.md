## Where Do Great Startup Ideas Come From: Stripe

Stripe's story is a perfect example of how addressing a real, widespread problem can lead to massive success. Before Stripe, I remember how complicated and daunting it was to set up a system to accept credit cards online. In the early 2000s, getting a merchant account felt like applying for a mortgage – lots of paperwork, faxes, personal guarantees, and fraud checks. It was possible, but far from easy.

I vividly recall the moment I first heard about Stripe. It was announced on Hacker News, and I knew immediately that I wanted it, even before seeing it in action. This reaction highlights the gap Stripe was filling.

At Justin.tv and Twitch, they used Authorize.Net, a typical example of a payment processor that was functional but painfully hard to use. Setting up took them about three months, including navigating a 30-page contract. Stripe, however, changed the game by addressing a problem common among YC startups – the hassle of using services like Authorize.Net.

What set Stripe apart was its focus on developers as customers. They created a product and documentation that every programmer would love, something entirely different from other payment processors that targeted business professionals. Stripe's approach was like what Steve Jobs would do if he designed a payments company.

Their marketing strategy was ingenious. They created a buzz within the developer community on platforms like Hacker News, making Stripe invites a hot commodity. Being able to use Stripe was almost like a badge of honor among developers.

An interesting point about Stripe is that it was the most expensive option in the market, yet people were desperate to use it. This speaks volumes about their product's value.

But let's not forget the skepticism they faced. Stripe was founded by two teenagers venturing into the highly regulated banking space, which seemed like a suicide mission. Besides the regulatory hurdles, they needed to secure partnerships with established banks, like Wells Fargo, which seemed nearly impossible for a startup at that time. And with PayPal already dominating the market, many saw Stripe as just another player in a crowded field.

The criticisms at that time often dismissed YC companies as inferior versions of existing successful companies. Yet Stripe proved that even in a market with big players, a well-executed, innovative idea can thrive. Their journey is a testament to solving a real problem in a user-friendly way and not being deterred by the challenges or competition.
