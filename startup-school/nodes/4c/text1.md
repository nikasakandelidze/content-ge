## Market Size for a Startup Idea

Evaluating the market size is a critical step in assessing a startup idea. Generally, startups aim for a market that's large enough to offer substantial growth potential â€” often quantified as a billion-dollar market. However, two types of markets can be promising for startups: those that are already large, and those that are small but showing rapid growth.

A compelling example of the latter is Coinbase, which started in 2012. At that time, the Bitcoin trading market was relatively small. However, the growth potential was evident. The founders of Coinbase recognized that if Bitcoin gained the traction and success many anticipated, the market for trading it would eventually expand to a billion-dollar scale. Their foresight in identifying a nascent but rapidly growing market was a key factor in Coinbase's eventual success.

This approach underscores the importance of not just looking at the current size of the market but also considering its growth trajectory and potential. Identifying markets that are on the brink of expansion can offer unique opportunities for startups to establish themselves early and grow with the market.
