## Consumer Idea: Google's Example
Let's take a quick look at Google and how it grew. Google's growth was phenomenal, and it was all based on word of mouth. In the beginning, you had to know about it from somewhere on the internet â€“ I first heard about it on Slashdot. You had to manually type in google.stanford.edu in your web browser to access it. They didn't spend money on advertising or growth hacking, yet they attracted millions of people to their site daily.

Now, Google is a giant, with tens of millions of daily users and earning huge revenues from ads on their site. Thinking back to their startup days, they really didn't invest in user acquisition, branding, or marketing. They just built an incredibly good product that people not only wanted but also recommended passionately. Friends were scolding each other for not using Google and insisting that it was far superior to other search engines. That level of user enthusiasm goes beyond just liking a product.

Interestingly, the Google founders initially weren't keen on running a startup. They even tried to sell their technology to Yahoo. But the product was so well-received and in demand that they were almost pulled into becoming a startup against their original intentions. This story is a classic example of how a great consumer product can grow organically. It sets a high bar for consumer startups: create something so compelling and of such high quality that it naturally draws users and growth, sometimes even redirecting the founders' original plans.
