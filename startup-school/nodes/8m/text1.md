## Key Habits for a Strong Co-Founder Relationship

To build and maintain a productive co-founder relationship, it's essential to establish certain habits and structures. Here are some key practices that can help:

1. **Regular One-on-Ones**: Even if you're in constant communication, scheduled one-on-ones are crucial. They provide a dedicated space to discuss ongoing topics. Keep a list of topics to address during these meetings instead of interrupting each other with minor issues.
2. **Bi-directional Feedback**: Make time in your meetings for both positive and constructive feedback. It should be a regular, routine part of your interactions, not something that feels intimidating or dreaded.
3. **Effective Handling of Constructive Feedback**: I remember the founders of Kiwi Biosciences had an excellent approach. When receiving constructive feedback, the other person wouldn't interrupt or argue, allowing for open and honest communication without defensiveness.
4. **Addressing Problems Early**: Don't delay hard conversations or wait for small issues to become big problems. It's much easier to resolve issues when they're still small.
5. **Engage a Coach or Counselor**: For difficult interpersonal situations, consider consulting a coach or counselor. Their expertise in resolving such issues can be invaluable, and seeking their help doesn't mean your relationship has big problems; it's about proactive management.
6. **Avoid Personal Statements; Normalize Failure**: Avoid personal attacks like "You always do this" or "I told you so." Instead, create an environment where failure is seen as a natural part of the startup journey and an opportunity for learning and growth.
7. **Comfortable with Disagreement**: Learn to argue effectively and understand who has the final say in decisions. Once a decision is made, commit to it and move forward, even if there is initial disagreement.


Remember, at the end of the day, you and your co-founder share the same ultimate goal: the success of your startup. You're on the same team, doing something challenging and against the odds, so it's crucial to work together in harmony and support each other. These habits can help ensure that you're both marching in the same direction, strengthening your partnership along the way.
