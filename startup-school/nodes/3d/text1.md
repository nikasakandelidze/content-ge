## Recognizing When to Leave a FAANG Job for Aspiring Entrepreneurs
For those in FAANG jobs contemplating when to exit, especially with entrepreneurial aspirations, the decision can be challenging. Often, the realization that it's time to leave comes when you or someone you know starts expressing deep dissatisfaction with the job, feeling trapped or disillusioned despite the financial rewards. This discontent, akin to a nagging inner conflict, is a clear indicator that it might be time to consider a change.

The key to making a smooth transition is maintaining a low personal burn rate, ensuring you're not overly dependent on the high salary and perks that come with these jobs. This financial independence gives you the flexibility to leave when you're ready and reduces the risk associated with stepping out on your own. Remember, if you're skilled and leave on good terms, the door often remains open for a return, minimizing the risk associated with leaving.

It's also crucial to avoid projects that leave you feeling morally conflicted or burnt out. Such experiences can lead to a negative outlook on the tech industry, which is detrimental if you're planning to start your own tech company. Having a clear plan from the outset about what you want to achieve in a FAANG role, whether it's acquiring specific skills, saving money, or gaining a visa, can guide your decisions and prevent you from falling into the 'golden handcuffs' trap.

When you're facing tempting bonuses or promotions, having a pre-set plan helps you stay focused on your long-term goals, making it easier to resist short-term temptations. In summary, the decision to leave a FAANG job for entrepreneurial pursuits hinges on personal fulfillment, financial readiness, and having a strategic plan for your career.
