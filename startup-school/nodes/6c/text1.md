## Why Founders Delay to Pivot

Let's explore why founders often wait too long to change their startup's direction. In my view, many people fall into this trap. One big reason is the fear of losing what you've already invested, known as loss aversion. You've put in so much, that it's hard to let go.

Another reason is having just a little success, like a few users or one customer, which can make you overly hopeful. It's tricky because often people are too nice to tell you they don't like your product. They might say encouraging things without really meaning it, which can be misleading.

Then, there's the fear of admitting failure. Changing direction might feel like you're giving up. Blaming others, like customers or investors, for your struggles is another common mistake. It's easier to say the world doesn't understand your idea than to admit it might be flawed.

Also, there's a lot of motivational talk out there telling you to keep believing in your idea. While inspiring, it's not always practical.

I've noticed something interesting about startups with just a bit of success. They often get stuck longer than those that fail outright. A complete failure lets founders move on quickly to new ideas, but a little success can trap talented people for a long time.

And about those stories of startups struggling for years before suddenly succeeding â€“ they're like lottery wins. Inspiring, but not a reliable plan. It's better to focus on what you can control and play the statistics, rather than hoping to become one of those rare success stories.

Remember, the decision to pivot or not is yours. It's about your life and your startup. While mentors and advisors can guide you, the final call is always yours. Don't expect someone else to make this crucial decision for you.
