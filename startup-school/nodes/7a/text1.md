## Three Common Themes in Successful Startup Ideas

I want to discuss where great startup ideas come from, focusing on three successful companies: Airbnb, Coinbase, and Stripe. These companies share three common themes that contributed to their success.

Firstly, timing played a crucial role. Each of these companies entered the market when there were already existing products or competitors. However, they saw the opportunity to create something significantly better, like 10 times better than what was already out there.

Secondly, most people, including founders and investors, initially thought these ideas were terrible. They seemed either too challenging to execute or just not good ideas at all.

Lastly, and perhaps most interestingly, each of these startups grew into opportunities far larger than even the founders initially realized. What started as seemingly small or specific ideas turned out to be massively impactful and influential in their respective industries. These three themes highlight the unpredictable and often surprising nature of startup success.
