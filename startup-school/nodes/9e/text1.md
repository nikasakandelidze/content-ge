## Setting Up a Company: Equity and Decision Making

When setting up a company, a CEO needs to think carefully about how to handle co-founder relationships and equity splits. These decisions can have a significant impact on the future of the company, especially if there are disagreements or conflicts.

One key approach is to aim for an equal equity split between co-founders. This helps prevent issues where one person feels they have more say because they own a slightly larger share of the company. Equal ownership promotes a sense of fairness and partnership, which is crucial for a healthy working relationship.

However, there's an important consideration when it comes to decision-making: avoiding deadlocks. If you have a 50-50 split, it's possible to reach a point where co-founders can't agree, and no decision gets made. This can be damaging to the company. A practical solution to this is to give the CEO one extra share. This doesn't significantly change the ownership balance â€“ you're still effectively equal co-founders. But, it allows for a tiebreaker in case of a deadlock. This extra share should be agreed upon in writing early on, so everyone understands and accepts this method of breaking ties.

This approach ensures that decisions can be made even in tough situations, helping the company move forward and reducing the risk of disputes turning into major issues that could threaten the company's survival.
