## Consumer Idea: Facebook's Example

Talking about startup success, Facebook is another classic example. When Facebook first launched at Harvard, it was said that within just 48 hours, 75% of the campus was using it. That's an incredibly fast adoption. Moreover, when investors like Peter Thiel and Reed Hoffman got involved, the average user was spending about two hours a day on the site. And guess what? They didn't spend a dime on marketing to achieve this.

This rapid growth of Facebook in its early days often gets overshadowed by stories of later growth strategies and tactics. But the truth is, Facebook's initial growth was all about the product pulling in users organically. People were eager for it to be available at their universities. They were genuinely excited about using it.

This is a vital lesson about consumer-focused startups. The really iconic ones, like Facebook, have one big thing in common: users who are genuinely excited and use the product a lot. In these cases, the founders didn't have to push hard to get people to use their product. They didn't rely on heavy advertising or other aggressive marketing tactics. Their success was driven by creating a product that people really wanted and loved to use.
