## How to Fairly Split Equity with Your Co-Founder

When it comes to splitting equity with your co-founder, a key piece of advice is to start with the idea of equal shares. While there are many ways to approach this, equal splitting is a solid baseline. The rationale behind this is simple: both co-founders should be equally motivated to contribute and work hard over the long term. If you don't value your co-founder enough to split equity equally, you might need to reconsider why they are your co-founder in the first place.

It's a common misconception that having the initial idea or starting work on it first merits a larger share of equity. However, ideas often change as you listen to your users, and the success of a startup depends on sustained effort over many years. The moment of coming up with the idea is just a tiny fraction of the entire journey.

There are several other reasons people cite for an unequal equity split, such as one co-founder taking a salary while the other doesn't, differences in age or experience, needing a tie-breaker in decisions, launching an MVP alone, or raising funds before teaming up. But these aren’t strong arguments for unequal splitting. The startup journey is long, and the real work lies ahead for both co-founders. Trying to secure a 'better deal' from your co-founder can lead to resentment and start your partnership on the wrong foot.

The main point is that both co-founders need to feel happy and motivated for the long haul. Startup outcomes are often extreme – they either do really well or not at all. So, it's not worth risking your co-founder relationship over a small percentage of equity. The focus should be on building a strong, equitable partnership that can withstand the ups and downs of the startup journey.
