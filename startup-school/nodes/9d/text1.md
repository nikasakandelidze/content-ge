## The Risks of Avoiding Conflict in Co-Founder Relationships

A key lesson I've learned from observing startup founders is the danger of avoiding conflict in co-founder relationships. One YC founder shared their experience of choosing a co-founder with whom they couldn't honestly disagree. They didn't know how to handle arguments constructively, leading to a breakdown in communication. Part of the issue was avoiding conflicts, and the other part was one co-founder resorting to unhealthy argument tactics.

It's surprising to hear about founders who spend most of their day together but haven't had a real conversation in weeks, or even months. This level of avoidance often signals a relationship beyond repair. In such cases, the CEO's role shifts from trying to fix the relationship to figuring out how to part ways effectively and with minimal damage.

When founders reach this stage, they often know in their hearts that separation is necessary, but they struggle to act on it. It feels bad to admit a partnership isn't working, and some would rather endure prolonged discomfort than confront the issue. However, delaying the inevitable tends to worsen the situation. The longer a strained relationship continues, the messier the eventual breakup â€“ leading to potential legal issues, complicated stock vesting situations, and overall harm to the startup.

This underscores the importance of addressing conflicts early on and developing healthy communication patterns with your co-founder. It's crucial for the long-term success of the startup and for maintaining a healthy working environment.
