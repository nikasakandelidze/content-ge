## Identifying Recent Changes Creating Opportunities for a Startup Idea

An important aspect to consider when evaluating a startup idea is whether something has recently changed, making your idea possible or necessary. These changes could be new technologies, shifts in regulations, or emerging problems that create fresh opportunities.

A prime example of this is Checker, a company that provides background checks through an API. Checker emerged at a time when delivery services like DoorDash, Instacart, and Uber were rapidly expanding. These companies needed to conduct background checks on a large scale for their growing workforce. While there were established companies offering background checks, they weren't equipped to handle the specific demands of these new, fast-growing delivery services.

Checker saw an opportunity created by this change in the market. They developed a solution specifically tailored to meet the new needs of these emerging gig economy companies. This is a classic case where a shift in the industry landscape, driven by the rise of new business models, opened up a niche for a startup to fill.

When brainstorming startup ideas, look for these kinds of shifts or recent developments. They can be a fertile ground for new business ideas that respond to emerging needs or take advantage of new technologies or regulatory environments.
