## The Pivot Story of Brex (YC W17)

Let's talk about Brex. They're a great example of a successful pivot. When they joined YC Winter '17, they started with a completely different idea but pivoted during the YC program. This pivot led them to a quick product-market fit, and in just two years, they raised hundreds of millions and became worth billions. It's an extraordinary story.

Originally, Brex had an idea for a new VR hardware headset for work. If I had to score it now, it would be pretty low. The idea was medium-big, but the founders didn't have experience in hardware or optics, so the founder/market fit was very low, like 1 out of 10. It was also hard to get started since they needed to hire hardware experts and needed a lot of money and time for development. The market feedback wasn't great either; people weren't interested in using it.

So, their initial idea scored about 2.5 out of 10. But then they pivoted to a credit card for startups. This idea was huge, definitely a 10 out of 10. It's a big market with many successful companies. The founder/market fit this time was perfect, a solid 10 out of 10. They had previously started and sold a successful FinTech company in Brazil, so they had the experience and connections.

Launching a new credit card product isn't easy, so it gets a 3 out of 10 for ease of starting. But their strong founder/market fit made it feasible. The early market feedback was excellent, around 8 out of 10. Their simple sales approach worked well, and they quickly gained customers.

This story of Brex shows how a well-considered pivot, aligned with the founders' expertise and market needs, can turn a struggling startup into a huge success.
