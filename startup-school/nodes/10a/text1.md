## How Much Equity to Give Your Co-founder

Deciding how much equity to give your co-founders is a big question for many startup founders. There's a lot of advice out there, but I believe there are some critical points often overlooked in this process. The equity split with your co-founders is a key factor in keeping them motivated over the many years it takes to build a successful, impactful company.

As a CEO, you need to think not just about what seems fair now but about what will keep your co-founders committed for the long haul. It’s important to consider their long-term interests, even if they may not be thinking about it themselves at the moment. A common mistake I see is founders simply negotiating an equity split without considering how it will affect their co-founders' motivation.

Now, it’s understandable to be cautious about giving away equity, especially considering that some startup teams do break up or founders may leave. Here’s where vesting comes in as a safety net. Typically, equity comes with a four-year vesting and a one-year cliff. This means co-founders earn their equity over four years, but if they leave within the first year, they don’t get any equity. This system is your safety net; it allows you to correct any potential mistakes in choosing co-founders without long-term harm to the company.

On the other side, being generous with equity can be beneficial. It creates a sense of ownership and long-term motivation. You want co-founders who feel like true owners, not just employees. Their stake in the company should be the reason they're willing to work extra hard, even during challenging times, which every startup faces.

While equal equity splits can be a simple rule of thumb and work in many cases, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. As a CEO, you should be thoughtful about what will truly motivate your co-founders. If you don’t value their long-term contribution and motivation, you might need to rethink why they are co-founders in the first place. A well-considered equity grant can make a significant difference in your startup’s success and viability by ensuring that your co-founders are as invested in the company's future as you are.
