## Choosing a Startup Idea in a Promising Field

When you're thinking about a startup, it's not just about the specific idea you have. It's also about choosing the right field or area for your idea. This is what we call picking a "good idea space." An idea space is a broader category that your startup idea fits into, like software for hospitals, tools for checking on big systems or delivering food.

Here's why the idea space matters: different types of startup ideas have different chances of success. For example, in the last 10 years, startups focusing on financial technology or specialized software for businesses often did really well. But startups in things like making new gadgets, social networks, or advertising technology didn't do as well.

Of course, these trends can change, but it's still smart to start in an area where startups usually do okay. Also, if your idea space matches well with your team's skills and experience (that's the founder-market fit), you're off to a good start. Even if your first idea isn't perfect, being in the right idea space means you might find other good ideas close to it.

Let's look at a real example: a company called Fivetran from YC's 2012-2013 batch. They started by making a tool for looking at big amounts of data. They showed it to some companies, but nobody wanted it. So, they tried a different data tool, but again, no luck. But because they kept talking to companies and learning what they really needed for data, they eventually made a tool that companies did want. This shows how starting in a good area, like data analysis tools, can help you find the right idea even if your first tries don't work out.
