## Effective Collaboration with Your Co-Founder

Once you've formed your founding team, it's crucial to establish efficient ways of working together. A key aspect of this is communication, which is as vital in a co-founder relationship as it is in any close personal relationship. It's often said that a co-founder relationship is akin to a marriage, and this analogy isn't far off.

Setting up effective communication channels should begin early in the relationship, even before you start working together. Aligning expectations is crucial – from work hours, and salary expectations, to the frequency of meetings. This early dialogue is an excellent way to test your communication skills with your co-founder and ensure you can handle difficult conversations productively.

From my own experience, there were a few topics we didn't discuss early enough in my first startup, and these became significant issues later. For instance, one of our co-founders had a personal timeline for when he expected our product to take off. We hadn’t discussed this timeline, so his frustration when things didn't progress as he hoped caught us all off guard, and he ended up leaving the company.

Another topic we overlooked was our individual financial situations and how long each of us could sustain little to no salary. This led to unexpected pressure on the company and even made us consider some less-than-ideal acquisition offers. Had we discussed these issues upfront, we could have made more informed decisions early on and possibly avoided some unnecessary distractions.

These scenarios are pretty common in startups. Discussing such topics in advance can save a lot of misunderstandings and stress down the road. Open, honest communication about expectations, finances, and personal timelines can significantly improve the working relationship with your co-founder.
