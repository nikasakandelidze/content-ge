## Planning for Co-founder disagreements: Non-violent Communication for Honest Feedback

When you both settle on a plan, it keeps things pleasant. So, to avoid getting upset with one another, find a way to speak that's not scary or hurtful. There's a wonderful book about this, 'Nonviolent Communication' by Marshall Rosenberg. It's all about being honest without being mean or putting others down.

There's a special way to do this that might seem different if you're not used to talking about feelings. When you want to point out an issue, try saying it like this: "I saw this thing, it made me feel like this because I wanted this. Can you do this?". It's not easy to master, but it's proven very helpful.

There are four parts to this way of communicating. Let's talk about each part:

1. **Observation**: start with something real, not an opinion. For example, instead of saying someone's lazy, say "You said you'd send the document last week but I haven't gotten it yet." Stick to facts, not opinions.

2. **Emotion**: next, talk about how the thing you saw made you feel. For example, "After not getting the document, I felt frustrated." Be careful not to mix up feelings and thoughts - feeling "frustrated" is valid, but saying "I feel like you're not taking this seriously" is actually a thought.

3. **Need**: understanding why you felt the way you did can often be linked to a basic need. Was it because you missed out on something? Try to figure out what it was you were missing. 

4. **Request**: finally, suggest a way to improve the situation. For instance, asking someone to turn up on time rather than simply saying "Be more respectful". 

Use these steps next time you have small issues to talk about. It's hard, but practicing will make it easier. If you want more tips, there's a great article by Dave Bailey about how to give useful feedback.
