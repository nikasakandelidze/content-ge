## Tar Pit Idea Examples: Web3

In the realm of startup ideas, Web3 is emerging as a significant trend. It's captivating for young founders because it presents the idea that everything we know could be rebuilt using this new technology. For someone entering the tech world, the concept that everything could be redone in a different, potentially better way is incredibly exciting.

However, the challenge with Web3 lies in its theoretical nature. It's one thing to imagine a world where everything is rebuilt with Web3 technology, but it's another to translate that into practical, working solutions. Founders venturing into this space need to go beyond just adding tokens or NFTs to their ideas. The bar for success in Web3 is higher, and it demands more than just theoretical concepts.

Consider OpenSea, for instance. When I interviewed the team behind it, what stood out was that their approach to NFTs wasn't just theoretical. They launched a platform, gained users, saw growth, and generated revenue. Their success stemmed from having a tangible, understandable product, not just an idea.

This example highlights an important aspect for Web3 startups: while the potential is vast, the focus should be on creating practical applications that people can use and understand, rather than getting lost in the theoretical possibilities of the technology.
