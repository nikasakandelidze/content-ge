## Exploring YC's Co-Founder Matching Platform

If you're on the lookout for a co-founder, [YC's co-founder matching platform](https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching) is a valuable resource. Here's how it works: you sign up and provide details about yourself and what you're looking for in a co-founder. The platform asks questions like whether you're technical, if you have a startup idea, your availability, industries of interest, and roles you can handle, like engineering or sales.

After you've completed your profile, our team manually reviews it to ensure authenticity. Once approved, you can explore profiles that meet your criteria. If you find someone interesting, you can message them, and if they're interested too, you can match and connect further.

One unique feature is the 'speed dating' aspect. You can set aside an hour for one-on-one video chats with potential co-founders, each lasting about five minutes. This is an efficient way to meet many people interested in startups.

As for the platform's success, since its launch, we've seen 40,000 profiles and over 100,000 matches. Several teams formed through the platform have applied to YC and been accepted, showing early promising signs.

For instance, Sequin's story is particularly inspiring. Verinda, a PM from Visa, was looking for a technical co-founder with fintech experience and a passion for gender equity. She matched with Mark, who had extensive engineering experience at PayPal and as a CTO. They clicked instantly over Zoom, met in person, and soon decided to work together. Their startup went through YC and raised significant funding.

Another example is Kiwi Biosciences. Angie, addressing her own issues with irritable bowel syndrome, matched with David, who had relevant industry experience. Initially, David was skeptical about Angie's idea but was impressed with her as a founder. After working on a trial project and filling out an extensive co-founder questionnaire, they decided to team up, went through YC, and successfully raised funding.

These stories illustrate how the platform can connect founders who might not have met otherwise, leading to successful collaborations and startups.
