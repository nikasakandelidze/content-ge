## Four Major Things to Avoid When Fighting with Co-founders

Let's talk about how to deal with problems in teamwork. John Gottman found four main things we should stay away from when we have disagreements. Here they are:

1. Criticism: Picture this. You are worried about a work issue, maybe a glitch that needs fixing pronto! You share your fears, but instead of addressing them, someone brings up an unrelated issue. Like the fact that you leave a lot of dishes in the sink. Criticizing or bringing up other issues rather than focusing on the problem at hand is not helpful.

2. Insulting: This one's simple. You voice your worries about the glitch, actually expecting a productive discussion. But, another person says something mean to you. Personal attacks won't fix matters. Remember, we are in a work setting - taking things personally is not fruitful.

3. Not taking responsibility: Imagine, there's a problem but someone fails to accept they have a part in it, thus delaying the solution. In their eyes, they've done nothing wrong so they see no problem. As a result, there are roadblocks to finding solutions. 

4. Avoiding problems: This is dangerous. Imagine raising a problem only for the other person to walk away instead of engaging in a conversation. Ignoring the problem will not bring any resolution.

These four points should help us understand what to avoid when faced with disagreements at work. Remember, the aim should always be to find a resolution, not create more problems.
