## The Role of Timing: Smartphones 

The rise of smartphones brought a similar wave of opportunities, much like the earlier Web 2.0 era. When smartphones first became popular, especially with the introduction of the iPhone and its App Store, there was a huge new platform for startups to explore.

In those early smartphone days, if you were developing mobile apps right as the iPhone hit the market, you had a significant advantage. The competition was relatively low compared to today. People were excited to try out new apps on their iPhones, and the market wasn't as saturated as it is now, where almost every app category is filled with numerous options.

This period was a unique time â€“ being in the right place at the right time mattered a lot. Early app developers could create relatively simple apps and still attract a large number of users simply because the novelty and excitement around smartphones and apps were so high. It highlights how timing and being early in a new technology wave can provide significant advantages for startups.
