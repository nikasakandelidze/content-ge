## The Importance of Documenting Co-Founder Agreements

When starting a business, especially with others, it's really important to write down all your agreements. In the beginning, when everything seems to be going smoothly, it's easy to overlook potential disagreements or issues that might come up later. But, dealing with problems becomes much harder if you don't have any written agreements. It might feel a bit awkward to discuss and document things like who owns what percentage of the company, or rules about how ownership might change over time (that's what founder vesting is about). But remember, people don't always recall things exactly as they happened. Having everything written down helps avoid misunderstandings and makes it easier to handle any issues that might arise in the future.
