## Understanding the Value of FAANG Jobs for Aspiring Technical Founders

Aspiring technical founders often have a skewed perception of the value a job at a FAANG company (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) can provide. This misunderstanding is largely due to the different motivations and career paths of founders versus typical employees or managers. Many founders see their peers aiming for managerial roles in these big tech companies and mistakenly believe that the same benefits apply to them as well. However, the path of a founder is distinctly different from that of a regular employee.

Reflecting on my own observations, I've noticed this pattern, especially among university students and recent graduates. Recruiters from prestigious firms like McKinsey or Accenture, and even tech giants like Google (which was a small startup at the time), often create an allure around the status and prestige of working with them. The selection process for job seekers can be influenced heavily by the presence and appeal of these companies at career fairs and similar events. It's not unusual for job seekers to be swayed by the companies that offer the most attractive perks or have the highest rankings, just as they might have chosen their college based on similar criteria.

This approach, while understandable, may not align with the needs and goals of those who aspire to be founders. The vast majority of career advice and recruitment efforts are tailored for people seeking traditional employment or management roles within large tech companies, not for potential founders. The real challenge is figuring out what aspiring founders, or those 'founder-curious', should do. They need to consider how a role at a FAANG company might or might not align with their long-term entrepreneurial goals, and whether it will equip them with the necessary skills, experiences, and networks to succeed in their own ventures.
