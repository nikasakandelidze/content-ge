## Finding Similar Big Companies as References for a Startup Idea

When you're thinking about a startup idea, it's useful to look at big companies doing something similar. These companies are not your direct competitors but can show that your idea might work. They are like examples or "proxies" for your business.

Take Rappi, a food delivery company in Latin America. When Rappi started, there were already successful delivery companies in other parts of the world, like DoorDash. These companies hadn't really taken off in Latin America yet. DoorDash served as a good example for Rappi. It showed that the idea of delivering food, which worked well in other places, could probably work in Latin America too.

So, when you have a startup idea, it's smart to look around and see if there are big companies doing similar things in other areas or countries. They can be a good sign that your idea has potential and might succeed in your market.
