## Where Do Great Startup Ideas Come From: Coinbase

Let's delve into the early days of Coinbase and how it revolutionized buying Bitcoin. In 2011-2012, purchasing Bitcoin was incredibly difficult. I remember how convoluted the process seemed back then – sending money orders to foreign countries, for example. It felt risky and almost like a scam, which deterred many, including myself.

The biggest Bitcoin exchange at that time was Mt. Gox. It was notorious for its unreliability and security issues; many people lost money there. Mt. Gox initially started as a platform for trading Magic: The Gathering cards before pivoting to Bitcoin, which is an interesting piece of its history.

Brian Armstrong, the founder of Coinbase, saw the challenges in buying Bitcoin. The existing methods were cumbersome and often untrustworthy. His vision was to create a platform that made buying Bitcoin simple and secure – something the market desperately needed.

Many were skeptical about Bitcoin and Coinbase. Bitcoin was seen as a tiny, unstable market, prone to bubbles and fraud. Additionally, getting a bank to work with a Bitcoin business was nearly impossible. Most Bitcoin exchanges were offshore due to differing regulatory environments.

Brian's initial YC application focused on P2P transfers, not just buying Bitcoin. He underestimated the simple yet powerful idea of buying Bitcoin in a secure, straightforward way using a debit card in the US. This simple concept executed well, laid the foundation for what became a hugely successful company.

Early Coinbase was strikingly simple. It was a website where you logged in, decided how much Bitcoin you wanted, and just bought it. No social network features, no complex graphs – its simplicity was its strength.

But what's remarkable is the skepticism Brian faced. Raising funds was a huge challenge, particularly on demo day. Had he taken this lack of investor interest as a final verdict, Coinbase might never have existed. This story underscores how sometimes, going against the prevailing investor sentiment and persisting with a clear, simple solution to a widespread problem can lead to extraordinary success.
