## How to Choose the Right Co-Founder

When looking for a co-founder, it's crucial to find someone who's a good fit for you and your startup. Think of a co-founder relationship like a marriage; you'll likely spend a lot of time together, especially if your startup takes off. Here are some key aspects to consider when evaluating potential co-founders:

* **Goals and Values**: Understand each other's motivations for starting a startup. It’s important to share similar values and objectives.
* **Handling Stress**: Discuss how each of you deals with stress. Startups can be high-pressure environments, so knowing how to support each other is vital.
* **Communication**: Ensure you can have open and honest conversations. Effective communication is key to moving forward productively.
* **Finances**: Talk about financial expectations and limitations. This includes salary requirements, how long you can go without a salary and any timelines for needing more significant funding.
* **Commitment**: Discuss each other's availability. How many hours per week can each commit? Are weekends and evenings open for work? It's not about having the same schedule but understanding and respecting each other's time.
* **Meet in Person**: If possible, meet face-to-face. It helps in understanding each other better and communicating nuances more effectively.


On the other hand, there are aspects people often overemphasize, like complementary skills. For example, a founder once told me they needed a co-founder solely for fundraising and networking. While these skills are important, most are learnable. It’s more crucial to have compatibility in the areas mentioned above.

However, there’s an exception: if you're non-technical, seriously consider finding a technical co-founder. This skill set is essential for tech startups and not as easily acquired as others like marketing or sales. In summary, finding a co-founder is about aligning on core values and communication styles, rather than just complementary skill sets.
