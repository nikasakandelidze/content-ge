## Startup Resilience: It's Not About Initial Motivation
In my analysis of startup founders, I've observed that initial motivations for starting a company aren't as crucial as one might think in determining a founder's resilience. Over time, I've seen founders with varying degrees of talent and different motivations. While it's often believed that having the "right" reasons for starting a company is key to resilience, my experience suggests otherwise.

Many people have different, perfectly valid reasons for launching a startup. Some say you shouldn't start a company just to make money, but I believe it's a legitimate motivation. After all, startups can be a path to significant financial success. If the drive to make money is what gets you started, then that's a valid beginning. Similarly, curiosity about what it's like to run a startup is also a fine reason to start one. The only way to truly understand the startup experience is by being part of it.

My conviction that initial motivations are not crucial comes from observing how these motivations evolve. I've seen founders who began with a short-term exit plan become deeply invested in their companies, leading them for years and even taking them public. This evolution shows that what matters more are the motivations that develop and sustain you through the challenging times every startup faces.

Enduring motivations, especially a genuine interest in the problem being addressed, are what truly fuel the resilience necessary for startup success. It's these evolving motivations, rather than the initial ones, that play a crucial role in navigating the ups and downs of the startup journey.
