## Assessing the Urgency of the Problem

When evaluating a startup idea, a crucial question to ask is: how acute, or pressing, is the problem it addresses? A common pitfall for many startups is focusing on issues that are either not significant or don't resonate strongly with potential users.

An excellent example of a startup addressing a critical problem is Brex, from the Winter 2017 batch. Brex created a credit card specifically designed for startups. Before Brex, startups in places like NYC struggled to obtain corporate credit cards, as banks were generally unwilling to issue them to new, unestablished businesses. This situation presented a clear and urgent problem: startups needed a way to manage finances, but the traditional banking system was not meeting this need.

Brex recognized and addressed this gap effectively. When the alternative to your solution is non-existent or inadequate, itâ€™s a strong indicator of an acute problem. This kind of situation represents a significant opportunity for a startup, as it means providing a solution to a problem that is both urgent and unaddressed, thereby creating considerable value for the target users.
