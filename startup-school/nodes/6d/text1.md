## Pivoting to Product-Market Fit

Product-market fit is a big topic, especially for startups. It's super important but really hard to achieve. Many people think they've got it, but the truth is, most don't. You'll know you have product-market fit when your biggest issue isn't getting more customers, but handling the growth you have.

One good reason to pivot, or change direction, is to give yourself more chances to find this fit. Imagine you've launched a product and it's not taking off. Pivoting gives you another try, another roll of the dice. It's about increasing your chances of success.

I've seen people pivot wisely and use these opportunities to their advantage. It's easier to be lucky when you try multiple times, but these attempts should be high-quality. You can't just keep changing your idea without fully developing and launching each one. By going through the complete process of making, completing, and sharing your product several times, you're essentially creating your own luck. The more quality attempts you make, the better your chances of hitting on something that really works.
