## When Should You Pivot?

Let's chat about when it's a good idea to change the direction of your startup, or in other words, pivot. One big reason for this is what we call "opportunity cost." Think of it like this: when you choose one path, you miss out on other things you could be doing. You can't do everything at once. If you're spending time on something that's clearly not working, you're missing out on better things you could be doing.

Here's a fun way to think about it. Imagine measuring how well things are going against the time you've spent on them. If you're less excited about your project and more confident that something else might work better, it might be time to pivot. Especially if you've been trying for a long time and things aren't improving. That's a strong sign.

But if you've only just started, it's less clear. You might need more time to see if things will work out.

Now, let's talk about good reasons to pivot. You might really dislike working on your current project. Or maybe it's not growing at all, no matter what you try. Perhaps you've learned that you're not the right person for this idea. Or you're depending on something you can't control, like waiting for a big trend to catch on. If you're out of new ideas to make your project work, that's also a sign to consider pivoting.

However, there are reasons not to pivot. Avoid pivoting just to escape hard work, like avoiding the sales part of your business. If you find yourself constantly changing ideas without seeing one through, that's not a good reason to pivot. And don't pivot just because you heard about a new trend. It's important to think carefully about why you're considering a change.

In short, pivoting is about finding the right balance: knowing when to give up on an idea that's not working and when to stick with it a bit longer to see if it can succeed.
