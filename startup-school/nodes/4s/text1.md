## Strategies for Coming Up with Startup Ideas: Finding Inspiration in Existing Success Stories
A practical approach to generating startup ideas is to look at companies that have recently succeeded and think about how you can adapt their models to create something new. A great example of this strategy is Nuvocargo. This company is akin to Flexport, but it focuses on Latin America, specifically helping U.S. companies import goods from Mexico.

Deepak, the founder of Nuvocargo, initially had a different idea while at Y Combinator. When he realized it wasn't going to pan out, he methodically began searching for a better concept. He chose Nuvocargo for clear, analytical reasons: it operated in a large market, had successful similar companies like Flexport to draw inspiration from, and even though Deepak wasn't an expert in the import-export field, he had enough connections to get started. He also believed he could effectively manage this type of operationally demanding business. His strategic and thoughtful approach paid off, as Nuvocargo has been performing exceptionally well.

So, when you're brainstorming startup ideas, consider looking at successful businesses and exploring how you can apply their models to different markets or sectors. Sometimes, a well-thought-out adaptation of a proven business model, as demonstrated by Nuvocargo, can lead to significant success.
