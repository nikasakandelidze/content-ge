## Working at a Startup: The Ideal Pre-Founder Environment

If you're aspiring to start your own company one day, immersing yourself in an environment surrounded by potential co-founders is key. In my view, working at a startup provides the perfect setting for this. At a startup, you gain invaluable insights into how startups operate, and you're more likely to be among colleagues who are open to taking risks compared to those at larger, more established companies.

For college students or current employees at large firms, I recommend considering a role at a startup. This experience can serve as an important stepping stone towards launching your own venture. Once you're in this dynamic environment, engage with your smart, like-minded colleagues. Discuss ideas that excite you, and consider evolving these ideas into side projects.

Often, during these brainstorming sessions, you might stumble upon a thought like, "It would be cool if someone built X." That's your cue to explore how you could be the one to build it. Consider creating a simple initial version or pitching the concept to potential users to gauge their interest. The goal here is not to immediately launch a blockbuster business, but to become comfortable with the process of bringing ideas to life and enjoying the excitement of launching something new.

For those who are not programmers, having the skills to build your idea is crucial. You either need to learn basic programming skills or partner with a co-founder who has these skills. Speaking from experience, I recommend starting to learn coding, even if it's just enough to create a basic first version of your idea. This skill set is invaluable in the early stages of turning your vision into reality.
