## The Retention Strategy of Big Tech Companies and Its Impact on Aspiring Founders

When considering a career in a FAANG company, it's crucial for potential founders to understand the retention strategies these companies employ. These strategies are not just efforts; they are sophisticated systems developed over decades, aimed at keeping employees within the company for as long as possible. Once you join, you become part of a well-oiled retention machine, akin to the user retention tactics these companies use for their products.

A key element of this retention system is how it's gamified. Employees are often lured by the promise of advancing to the next level, unlocking new rewards, and feeling a sense of progression, much like a video game. However, what many don't realize is how these companies use equity as part of their retention strategy. The common narrative is that you join, receive a signing bonus and an equity package, and feel well-compensated. The catch is that this equity vests over a period, typically four years, which subtly encourages employees to stay longer to fully realize these benefits.

This system plays on loss aversion, a psychological principle where people irrationally overvalue something they own to avoid losing it, as opposed to something they never had. As employees see their unvested equity as a form of savings, they are less likely to leave, even if they are dissatisfied with their job. This feeling is compounded by the lifestyle inflation common among FAANG employees, who often increase their spending in line with their perceived wealth, making it financially difficult to leave and start a company.

Additionally, many employees find themselves working on projects that, while initially exciting, may never come to fruition or have a real impact. This can lead to a sense of futility, as years of work might be spent on speculative projects or moonshots that get axed. The allure of working on something groundbreaking is often what attracts talent, but the reality can be quite different.
