## The Best Time to Pivot

The best time to pivot? Look out for these signs. If you've been trying to get users for weeks or months and feel hopeless, it's probably time to pivot. Also, if your idea is too big to start, like needing $100 million to build a prototype, that's a clear sign to rethink your approach.

Trust your gut feeling. Many founders deep down know their idea isn't working, even if they try to convince others it is. If you can't believe in your own idea, it's a strong signal to pivot. You know your business better than anyone.

Beware of pivoting too often, though. Constant changes can cause frustration and burnout, which can be more harmful than sticking with a less-than-perfect idea. If you're enjoying the journey, even with a flawed idea, you might find a way to make it work. But if pivoting makes you unhappy, it's likely to lead to giving up.

Find a balance. Don't pivot every day, but don't stubbornly cling to an idea for years if it's not working. Like most things in life, the key is finding the middle ground.

And a note on team management: pivoting is tough with employees. It's slower and can demotivate your team. Avoid expanding your team until you're confident in your idea. Adding people too soon can bring more problems than solutions.
