## Theory of Supply and Demand in Startup Idea Space

Let's break down the theory of supply and demand as it applies to startups, focusing on what kinds of ideas attract founders and what the market actually needs. This perspective can really change how we view startup opportunities.

On the supply side, consider startup ideas that sound cool and fun â€“ like those involving hanging out with celebrities or going to concerts. There's a huge pool of founders who are excited about these ideas. Why? Because they sound glamorous and enjoyable. Similarly, many founders might be drawn to ideas like music or concert discovery apps because they align with fun activities.

However, on the other end of the spectrum, there are startup ideas that require specific skills and aren't as 'sexy.' Think about open-source developer tools or quantum computing startups. The pool of founders capable and willing to work on these is much smaller. These areas require technical expertise and a specific passion that not everyone has.

Now, let's look at the demand side. How many people are looking for another social app? Probably very few. The market is flooded with apps, and most people aren't actively seeking out new ones. However consider the demand for high-quality software that solves significant business problems, making companies more efficient. That demand is enormous. A tool that boosts productivity, like a no-code platform for non-technical people, has a potentially infinite demand.

This supply and demand theory in startups suggests that ideas with an oversupply of interested founders relative to market demand are often tar pits. If you have a unique skill set or expertise in a specific area, you're more likely to stand out and succeed.

Interestingly, many potential founders with unique insights or experience in niche industries might not think the startup world is for them. They may feel that startups are all about social networks or consumer apps. However, if you've solved a complex problem in a large industry, you might be an ideal candidate to start a successful startup. Your unique perspective and expertise can be incredibly valuable in solving real-world problems on a larger scale. Startups aren't just about creating apps; they're about solving problems and filling gaps in various sectors.
