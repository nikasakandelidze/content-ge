## Why You Need a Technical Co-Founder Instead of a Dev Shop

For non-technical founders, one of the biggest challenges is deciding between finding a technical co-founder or hiring a development shop (Dev shop) to build their product. My advice is to seriously consider getting a technical co-founder. Here's why:

Dev shops come with several drawbacks, especially for early-stage startups. First off, they're expensive right from the start. More importantly, they're not ideal for the rapid iteration that startups often need. Dev shops are set up to deliver specific, well-defined projects. However, in a startup, what you need to build can change rapidly as you learn from your users. You're often 'feeling around in the dark,' and your requirements might evolve quickly. Dev shops generally aren’t equipped to adapt at this pace.

Additionally, dev shops don’t have a vested interest in your product or users. Their goal is to complete the task you pay them for, not to immerse themselves in understanding and caring about your users' needs. This can result in a product that doesn’t quite hit the mark.

On the other hand, a technical co-founder brings more than just coding skills. They share your commitment and vision for the startup and are more flexible and aligned with the evolving needs of your business and its users. If you can't find a technical co-founder, consider learning some coding basics yourself. It’s a valuable skill that can significantly benefit your startup in its early stages. A technical co-founder is not just an employee; they are an investment in your startup’s future.
