## John Gottman's Marriage Research & Startup Relationships

So, when you decide to start a business with someone, you have a big job ahead of you. Typically, people who start a business together need to plan for a relationship that might last about 10 years. That's a big step to take with someone you might have only known for a few months, or even just in the work world.

It's tricky because the only real examples of this type of long-term partnership that you might have seen before are the ones between our moms and dads. So, let's take a quick look at research about successful marriages to help us understand.

There's this guy named John Gottman who studies marriages. He's pretty well-known and has been talked about in a few different places. He has an interesting skill - he can watch a couple argue about something for 15 minutes and then predict with 85% accuracy whether they'll still be married four years later. If he watches them for an hour and also asks about their plans and hopes, his prediction rate jumps to 94%.

He shows videos of these couples to different experts like priests, psychologists, and counselors, and even people who are happily married. Yet none of them can predict whether the couple will last as well as John can. 

He noticed something: how a couple argues can predict how long they will stay together. Surprisingly, he found that it's not about never fighting. Everybody fights, over the same things usually: money, children, intimacy, time, jealousy, and in-laws. Most of the time, they argue about what to do with their free time.

And guess what? The same things can cause disagreements when you're starting a business with someone. These are all things you and your business partners might end up arguing about.

But, if we know everyone has disagreements and we can predict what they will be about, we can prepare for those disagreements. We can plan how to handle those situations. This could be the key to making sure we continue to work together on our passion projects.
