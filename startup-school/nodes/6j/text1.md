## The Pivot Story of Magic (YC W15)

Magic's story is a remarkable example of a successful pivot in the startup world. They were part of the Winter '15 batch at YC and shifted their focus during the program, ultimately building a profitable and sustainable business. We all wish for such a success story!

Initially, Magic started with an app for blood pressure coaching. It wasn't a huge idea, maybe a 2 out of 10 in potential size. In terms of founder/market fit, they didn’t have much experience in health, so again, a low score, around 2 out of 10. However, they were quick to get started, earning an 8 out of 10, as they developed the app fast and got users quickly.

But the early market feedback wasn't great. People were polite, but hardly anyone used the app. The usage was really low, making it clear they needed to pivot.

Realizing this, the team quickly shifted gears and experimented with different prototypes. They created the prototype for Magic in just one weekend, which is pretty impressive. When they shared it on Hacker News, it went viral, reaching number one and garnering about 2,000 upvotes. It captured people's imagination overnight and even made a big splash in the press.

This pivot didn’t seem to have an obvious founder/market fit either, but it was easy to start and received fantastic early market feedback. The idea had the potential to be big, which was exciting.

Interestingly, Magic's success also inspired a lot of similar ideas. Many current chatbot concepts can trace their roots back to Magic's viral success. It's amazing how their pivot not only transformed their own business but also influenced a whole trend in the tech industry.
