## Reflecting on Startup Risks: "What Do I Have to Lose?"

If you're contemplating whether to start a company, a practical piece of advice I'd offer is to realistically assess what you have to lose. This isn't just a rhetorical question, but a crucial step in understanding your own tolerance for risk and potential loss. Consider the worst-case scenario: if your startup doesn't succeed, you might end up without any significant income for a year. Can you handle that?

The impact of this decision varies greatly depending on your personal and professional circumstances. For someone fresh out of college, dedicating a year to a startup might not be a significant risk. Job opportunities could still be available afterward. However, for someone deeply entrenched in a stable career with significant prospects, like a long-term employee at a major tech company, the stakes are higher. Missing out on potential promotions or salary increments could be a substantial loss.

Acknowledging and accepting the worst-case scenario is crucial in deciding whether to embark on a startup journey. If the thought of this scenario causes overwhelming anxiety, it might hinder your startup efforts. However, there's another factor to consider: the invaluable learning experience of starting a company. The breadth of skills and insights you gain as a founder can be immensely beneficial, regardless of the venture's outcome.

As a startup founder, you're thrown into various roles — sales, product development, customer support — all at once. This experience can be enlightening, helping you discover what type of work you enjoy and where to focus your career in the future. For some, an unsuccessful startup becomes a stepping stone to another entrepreneurial venture, armed with lessons from past mistakes. Others might find their passion in specializing in a specific area, choosing to join a company that allows them to excel in that field.
