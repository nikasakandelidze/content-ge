## Planning for Co-founder disagreements: Divide and Conquer

So, you're making a new business or startup, right? With your business partner, it's important to make a clear plan right from the start. You want to avoid problems, right? 

First, you can "divide and conquer". This just means deciding who is in charge of what parts of the business, right from the beginning. That way, if there's a problem in a certain part of the business, it's obvious who should handle it. This can help avoid arguments and misunderstandings.

Don't worry too much about competition at the start. It usually doesn't cause problems until you're further along. As you go on, you'll assign more and more roles and whoever is in charge of that area will handle problems as they pop up.

What happens if things get out of control? Well, after you divide up the tasks, it's important to know what a win looks like and what a failure looks like. You need to decide when to step in and help someone with their part. Also, you need to decide how well something needs to be going before you leave it alone and let the person in charge do their thing.

Good times to step in could be once you've gathered the money you need or if your work is being done on time. Bad times could be when you need to stop everything and talk about a big problem.

When you have to have a serious talk, it's important not to get angry or emotional. It can stop you from thinking clearly. Try to set these rules early. It's much easier to talk about difficult things when you're calm and not upset.

Finally, remember that in most situations, the final decision comes from the head of the company, the CEO. If there's a problem with the CEO, it's the job of the board. At the start, the board is often just the founders, so you must work it out together. That's your second defense against problems.
