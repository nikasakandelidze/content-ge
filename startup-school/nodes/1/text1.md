## What is a startup
A startup is a special type of company that's built to grow very quickly. It's not just any new company. It doesn't have to be about technology, getting money from investors, planning to be sold or going public. The most important thing for a startup is rapid growth. All the other things we often think about when we hear "startup" come from this need to grow quickly.

Every year, millions of companies start up in the US. But only a few of them are what we call startups. Many are businesses like restaurants, barbershops, or plumbing services. These aren't usually considered startups because they're not made to grow fast. For example, a barbershop doesn't grow quickly like a search engine company would.

When I say startups are meant to grow fast, I mean two things. First, they're planned that way, but it's also true that most startups don't succeed. Second, startups are naturally different, just like a redwood tree seedling is different from a bean sprout.

That's why we have a special word, "startup," for these fast-growing companies. If all companies were similar and only some got really big because of luck or hard work, we wouldn't need a separate term. We could just talk about super-successful companies and others. However, startups are different at their core from other types of businesses. Google, for instance, wasn't just a barbershop whose owners were really lucky or worked hard. It was different right from the start.

To grow quickly, a company needs to offer something a lot of people want and be able to reach and serve a large market. That's what sets a company like Google apart from a barbershop. Barbershops can't grow on a large scale.

For a company to become really big, it must: (a) create something many people want, and (b) be able to reach and serve all those people. Barbershops are good at (a) since almost everyone needs a haircut. But they struggle with (b). They serve customers in person, and customers won't travel far for a haircut. Plus, even if they did, the barbershop couldn't handle too many customers.

Creating software is a good way to solve (b), but you can still be limited by (a). For example, software teaching Tibetan to Hungarian speakers might reach its audience, but it's a small group. However, software teaching English to Chinese speakers has a much bigger potential market, fitting into the startup category.

Most businesses face limits in either (a) or (b). What makes successful startups different is that they break these limits.
