## Where Do Great Startup Ideas Come From: Airbnb

Let's dive into the story of Airbnb. It's interesting to note how perspectives have changed over time. Before Airbnb became popular, platforms like VRBO and Couchsurfing were already in the market. I remember thinking of Airbnb as just another entrant in a crowded space. But they approached things differently.

Airbnb wasn't the first in its field, but it spotted the gaps in existing services. For instance, VRBO and Craigslist didn't handle payments directly, which meant a lot of friction between strangers trying to arrange stays. Moreover, they charged hosts to list their properties. Airbnb saw the potential in making it free for hosts, understanding that attracting more hosts was key to their success.

A pivotal aspect of Airbnb's journey was solving their own real-life problem. Founders Joe and Nate needed to make rent, so they rented out space in their apartment during a big conference. This personal need led to an idea far from the typical vacation rental concept dominating platforms like VRBO. Interestingly, their timing coincided with the 2008 financial crash, when many were looking for ways to earn extra income.

Another crucial factor was using their own product. Airbnbâ€™s founders didn't initially realize the need for an integrated payment system until they experienced the problem firsthand. These insights might seem obvious now, but at the time, they were groundbreaking.

Investor perspectives back then were also quite different. Renting a room in a house where the host was present seemed unappealing, especially to more affluent investors used to hotels. Also, the idea of monetizing community spaces was seen as uncool or impure, deviating from the communal, non-commercial ethos prevalent at the time.

In my experience, similar to what happened with Twitch, diversifying the business model and accepting direct payments was crucial. This approach was frowned upon back then, but it proved successful. If Airbnb had listened to most investors or founders then, it might never have become what it is today. They dared to charge money in a space where building a free network was the norm. This bold move, combined with their unique insights and timing, was key to their success.
