## Deciding When to Start Your Own Company

Determining the right moment to leave your job and start a company is a crucial decision. Ideally, one of your side projects would gain significant traction, clearly signaling the time to make your move. However, this isn't always the case. If you're serious about founding a company, even after launching side projects and gaining some users, the feedback you receive will likely be varied.

To assess the potential of your side project as a startup idea, I'd recommend a piece of advice from Paul Buchheit, working at Y Combinator. He suggests that creating a product loved by a few is more valuable than one met with indifference by many. If your project evokes strong reactions, where users claim it has significantly impacted their lives, then you might be onto something significant. A single enthusiastic user of a basic prototype is more indicative of potential than countless sign-ups for a non-existent product.

Focus less on the immediate success of your side projects and more on your enjoyment and learning during the process. If you find your day job draining but are invigorated by working on side projects in your free time, this could be a sign to consider pursuing your own ideas full-time. Pay attention to how well you collaborate with your side project partners. If you work well together and share entrepreneurial aspirations, that's a valuable and rare combination.

Remember, your initial motivations for starting a company can evolve. Simply being curious about the startup experience can be a good enough reason to begin. Always consider the worst-case scenario and ensure you're comfortable with that outcome. If you don't have an idea or a co-founder yet, start by engaging with smart people, brainstorming ideas, and working on side projects. Once you find someone you click with and both of you are keen on starting a company, it might be time to take the leap. I truly hope you do.
