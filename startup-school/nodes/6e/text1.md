## How to Find a Better Idea

Let's talk about how you can find a better idea for your startup. My advice is simple: look for something that excites you more and makes you feel optimistic. It should be an idea that makes you eager to get up in the morning and work on it.

Here's something interesting: sometimes, the harder ideas are actually better. I've seen people working on unexciting things, like ad tech, and they're not inspired by it. But when they switch to something exciting, like helping small businesses or creating a unique service for a new market, they light up. Their enthusiasm becomes contagious.

If you're working on something because it seems like a "good startup idea" but it doesn't inspire you, it might be time to look for something that does. Also, be honest with yourself about what you're good at and what you're not. Play to your strengths.

When looking for a new idea, especially if you're pivoting, choose something you can build and test quickly. Don't jump from one hard-to-launch idea to another. Aim for ideas that are easier and faster to bring to life.

A quick reminder: it's okay to work on an idea that doesn't need venture capital. Most businesses in the world don't require it. Be aware of this, especially if you're consuming a lot of content focused on venture capital-funded startups.

If you're aiming for venture capital, the idea matters a lot. Ask yourself: Can this business make hundreds of millions, or even billions, in net revenue per year? Can it grow quickly, and maybe become a publicly-traded company someday? Technology should be a key component, and you'll likely need high margins, like those in software businesses.

Remember, it's your journey, your dream. You have to make the call on what's right for you and your startup.
