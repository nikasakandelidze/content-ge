was what yc companies were isn't that hilarious i don't know if people remember that but that was the reputation of yc companies is like oh yeah they'll take a existing idea that's good and they'll make like a less popular version of it which which kills me because like in all three of these cases these folks had the problem they had experience and in hindsight there was an obvious opportunity to make something 10x better but most people thought they were idiots and that's probably the overarching theme they had to be contrarian to walk down this path because if they had asked 10 startup experts 10 investors 10 fellow founders eight of them would have 


that's probably the overarching theme
18:45
they had to be contrarian
Contrarian
18:47
to walk down this path because if they
18:49
had asked
18:50
10 startup experts 10 investors 10
18:53
fellow founders eight of them would have
18:55
told them that they were stupid
18:58
and like they had to build good products
They had to build great good products
19:00
like you can't take for granted you
19:02
can't we can't you know talk on a
19:04
whiteboard and plan our strategy and win
19:07
all of these founders had to actually do
19:09
it and the doing it part was the hard
19:12
part
19:13
yes
19:13
right like all these people had to
19:15
execute and build a product that people
19:17
loved and actually worked and all these
19:18
people built products that handled
19:20
hundreds of millions of dollars and they
19:21
couldn't lose the money
19:23
right so the actual execution bits
19:26
talk is cheap execution's hard
19:28
execution's expensive they all these
19:30
folks had to execute
19:32
so i think what the takeaway here is
Takeaway
19:35
if we can sum this up
19:36
one you shouldn't give a [ __ ] if there's
Incumbents
19:38
an existing product in the market
19:40
if you're a user of that product or your
19:42
friends or users of that product and
19:43
they all hate it and you should not give
19:45
a [ __ ]
19:47
um two
Don't care about experts
19:49
you should not give a [ __ ] if most of
19:51
the people around you who you believe
Market Research
19:53
are experts
19:55
don't think this is a good idea
19:57
especially you shouldn't care if they're
20:00
not going to be users if they have no
20:02
experience with the pain of using the
20:04
existing product and then three
Market math
20:09
be very careful about your initial
20:11
market math be very careful about
20:14
pretending that you know how big the
20:16
market could be it turns out with so
20:17
many of these transformational
20:18
technologies there are use cases you
20:21
can't dream of that once you build a 10x
20:23
better product other people will do
20:26
and so
20:27
each and every time these founders were
20:29
presenting oh we have a market size of
20:31
blank the next time they raised money
20:33
they could say actually we made a
20:34
mistake the market size is actually
20:36
bigger we didn't think of this we didn't
20:38
think of that and so don't be
20:39
discouraged if someone's like that's a
20:41
tiny market that's kind of a [ __ ]
20:44
um thing that would have killed all
20:45
these companies
20:47
all right talk to you later man
