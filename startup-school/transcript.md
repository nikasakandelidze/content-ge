## Topics to discuss before committing
do you have a list of topics you recommend that Founders discuss with their co-founders before committing yeah so this list is by no means exhaustive but here are some good ones to start the conversation so one is um how much do you want to work on your startup versus not we talked about this earlier but um you know evenings weekends vacations like kind of what are those expectations what do you guys both have in your minds it can be pretty different they can be very different sometimes people just assume and don't have the conversation just like don't assume you know put it out there um what is being available and like what do response times look like like you know if I slack you and you write back to me six hours later like am I gonna be frustrated or am I gonna think you're really responsive like you know people have different senses of this how long can each of us go without salary or benefits again this is a very important one to talk about and what do each of you need to see at different Milestones to keep working on it and to stay motivated does anyone have a it needs to be working by X date um and if so like what does working look like yeah this is such great advice I can definitely see how misalignments on these expectations can start small but really Fester into resentment over time absolutely 


aside from aligning 

on
Building trust
20:08
expectations we hear that building trust is another key element of a co-founder relationship
20:13
I've personally seen this at the root of lots of relationship issues not just for co-founders but for friendships family
20:19
relationships Etc we see co-founder breakups all the time at YC and a lot of them stem from a lack of trust that
20:25
grows out of control Divya how has trust played a role in your co-founder relationship yeah so trust is a really
20:32
big one one of the things I haven't mentioned until now is that for both my startups one of my co-founders is my
20:38
husband still still my husband you're gonna ask um and for my second company he was my
20:44
only co-founder it was just the two of us and one of the reasons we were able to make decisions so quickly and draw
20:51
such clear lines of ownership was that we already had so much trust built up from being married but also from having
20:57
run a company together earlier um you know of course not everyone comes in with this much underlying trust but
21:03
having that trust made the co-founder relationship very very functional I think previously existing relationships
21:10
with your co-founders could go both ways right of course personal relationships don't always translate into functional
21:16
co-founder relationships yeah that's 100 True a previously existing personal relationship
21:22
um could totally go both ways um and let me give you an example of one that did not go so well so
21:28
um last batch last YC batch we had a company apply um we we thought the founder was great
21:34
and we said why don't you come back with a co-founder and so um he went and he found a friend as someone who he'd been
21:39
very good friends with for a long time they hadn't worked together he convinced him to join the companies they came back they started the batch
21:45
um the CEO had been running the company for about six months and to him it really felt like his company oh no yeah
21:51
yeah so he brought in this friend and from day one he just kind of micromanaged him and didn't give him
21:58
enough space to succeed or fail at the projects He was responsible for and this is an important one right he would kind
22:04
of jump in before the project had time to work because at a startup like things take time right and everyone needs a
22:11
little bit of space and they need that trust um and so he would jump in and he would just kind of berate his co-founder when
22:17
things were starting to go wrong and when you trust someone like you give them this room to fail right and the
22:24
psychological safety to make mistakes in this case the co-founder relationship ended with the two so you know we got a
22:30
slack message one morning and they were like the two of us we were in a bar midnight last night with a bunch of our friends the CEO was like berating his
22:38
co-founder and then you know the co-founder resigned abruptly the next morning so it's just not a good situation that sounds really rough yeah
22:45
I would not want to be in a situation like that we do have a couple tips to help with building trust so number one
22:51
is is trust people by default trust them until they lose your trust not vice
22:56
versa a lot of good Founders tell us they do this because when you operate the other way around like in the example
23:01
Olivia just gave people end up feeling micromanaged they feel not trusted and all this negativity will continue to
23:07
build up if you say you're gonna do something do it if you're not gonna get it done that's fine like startups run
23:13
super fast you will often have more things than you can finish on your plate but if you're not going to do it you
23:18
should communicate early often and honestly create space for mistakes you are going to make mistakes all the time
23:25
both you and your co-founder so don't say things like I told you so it's important to learn from mistakes
23:31
together rather than assigning blame when something goes wrong and lastly the more time you can spend physically
23:37
together the better this lowers the friction to asking questions talking about the little things and that can
23:42
expedite making progress on both your startup and your relationship communicating in person can also help
23:48
you learn or get a better understanding for the way your co-founders and that can help you build trust as
23:53
well thanks Kat those are great and um you know they can kind of build a really
23:58
good foundation for building a trusting relationship um so in addition to that underlying trust that you're going to be
How to setup for quick decision making
24:04
continually working at um there might need to be some structural roles and responsibilities that are defined to keep decision making
24:11
really fast so on my first company we made the mistake of trying to keep everything equal
24:17
um and there are many of you there are four of us yeah um so you know we talked earlier about how splitting Equity equally is a good
24:24
idea and like totally agree with that the equity was not the problem the first kind of yellow flag that came up was
24:29
that we decided to not have any titles like we all called ourselves co-founder um and so in and of itself that wasn't
24:36
really a problem but there's kind of two issues with this one is as it correlated that we tried to make all of our
24:42
decisions by consensus consensus meaning you all had to agree on the decision to move forward yeah for like any decision
24:49
um so I don't think I need to go into it with this group on my why that's a bad idea but at the time it felt really equal and it felt Equitable but also the
24:56
the fact that we had no type no titles was a little bit of a yellow flag because it was an early indicator that
25:01
the team couldn't have hard conversations and we couldn't make decisions when there was disagreement
25:07
right and so it was like the consensus and the lack of titles were like both kind of symptoms of the same thing you
25:13
know having to make decisions by consensus was ultimately disastrous like we would just spin we would get stuck in gridlock
25:19
um so let's talk about some ways to protect against this so you all don't repeat my mistake yeah so as Divya mentioned having clear titles or at
25:26
least naming one person the CEO can certainly help none of this co-ceo stuff it helps break ties and disagreement and
25:33
it's also just really good practice for having hard conversations where two people may not agree not being able to
25:38
pick a CEO could be a sign that you're not able to make hard decisions together in addition to titles it's important to
25:45
establish a few other things that can help with decision making so clear areas of ownership within the company who is
25:50
the final decision maker for different types of decisions this could be a different person in different functions but it's important to know who it is
25:57
what happens if the other person degrees disagrees slightly versus strongly maybe
26:02
the way you deal with it is different in those cases and finally it can be helpful to set up a structure for
26:07
accountability so once you've made your decision at some point you should check back in to see how that decision played
26:13
out and whether anything needs to change in the process moving forward clear areas of ownership are very very
26:18
important in a startup and a business and in addition in order to make that work it's also very important to
Personality and communication styles
26:24
understand each other's personality and communication Styles and so you know here are some tips on that so one is
26:30
keep keep an eye on your on each other's mental health right like likely neither of you is a mental health professional
26:35
or anything like that but you can kind of see some early indicators is your co-founder burning out are they taking care of themselves are they starting to
26:41
kind of become more reactive or more emotional like these are some things to look out for and catch early related
26:47
know how each of you reacts when you're under stress or or when you're having a
26:52
tough conversation cat let me ask you a question when you're in a stressful tough conversation do you tend to attack
26:58
or retreat I get very aggressive when I feel upset so I would say attack yeah
27:05
same um I am I'm in the same boat and um this is something that I assumed was the case
27:11
for everyone but it's not right like people have very different personality types I've been in a few um close professional relationships or
27:17
co-founder relationships if I'm very frustrated I like you I get very spun up like I get very communicative
27:22
communicative I crave engagement you want to solve the problem right now exactly like I want to get in like right
27:28
now right now right it might not always be a good idea right like we might be emotional but I'm still like I wanna I wanna get through this and I've worked
27:34
with people that in those situations like they just kind of want to withdraw a little bit like they want to cool down
27:40
maybe they don't want to engage with me because I'm being crazy um right but like people sometimes just
27:45
want like a little bit of time to calm down and I think sometimes when there's a mismatch in these Styles it can create
27:50
a little bit of a vicious cycle it can self-perpetuate the more you want to talk to them the more they are not
27:56
trying to talk to you right now right and I might perceive that they don't care about the problem um so it's just important to know how
28:02
people react in stress a few other things so does your co-founder tend to speak up when they see a small problem
28:07
or do they bottle it up until there's a huge frustration it's important to know how big of a deal things are when someone brings things up what
28:14
environments are most comfortable for your co-founder to voice concerns is it you know like a walk and talk is it
28:20
maybe over a meal is it in a scheduled structured one-on-one where there's time set aside for concerns here's one that
28:26
might be a little bit counter-intuitive but are you both comfortable praising each other and celebrating each other's wins this can actually be very
28:32
uncomfortable for people sometimes can you you know give each other positive feedback and can you graciously accept positive feedback like this can really
28:39
build a strong co-founder relationship and lastly will you feel attacked if your co-founder makes a suggestion about
28:45
your work because as we talked about everyone's going to make a lot of mistakes right and everyone needs to be able to talk about these in a way that
28:52
isn't emotionally loaded so figure out what that looks like for you um and can you do it without taking it personally I
28:58
definitely have an aggressive personal type when I'm stressed so this is all really really helpful stuff to think
29:03
about let's wrap up by talking about a few habits and structures you can put in place to try to build and Foster a
Useful habits for a productive relationship
29:09
productive co-founder relationship number one have regularly scheduled one-on-ones even if you talk to each
29:14
other all the time it can also be helpful to keep a list of ongoing topics that you add to as you think of things
29:19
and if there's something non-urgent just you know add it to the list instead of interrupting your co-founder every time there's something small in those 101s
29:26
definitely Reserve time for bi-directional feedback both positive and constructive make this something
29:31
that's part of the flow make it routine not something that feels like a big deal that you dread all the time actually I
29:37
have a great example the founders from kiwi biosciences which I talked about earlier do something that I think is pretty cool when one person gives
29:43
constructive feedback the other person doesn't interrupt or argue it's a really neat way to let someone vent without
29:49
feeling like they have to defend why they feel upset and I think it also helps with feeling like it's okay to
29:55
talk about even the smallest things and that leads me to the next point which is don't delay hard conversations and don't
30:00
wait until things are a big problem before you mention them the thing with problems is that they're easier to solve
30:06
when they're small engage a coach or counselor for tricky interpersonal situations don't feel bad about this
30:12
this is really helpful I highly recommend it these coaches is literally their job to help people through these
30:18
problems they've seen it all and they can help you and again it doesn't mean you have a big problem because you're
30:23
engaging a coach right like you can you can tackle the problem while it's small and we've talked about this next one a couple times already but we do think
30:29
it's really important avoid personal statements and normalize failure we've said this multiple times failure is
30:35
going to happen all the time and you need to create space for that so don't say things like I told you so don't say
30:42
Hey you always do this you always XYZ these are personal attacks and you don't really want that in your co-founder
30:48
relationship argue and get comfortable arguing but you should know who ultimately is the decision maker
30:54
disagree and commit at some point your team will have to make a decision unless you're you know trying to to do the
31:00
consensus thing don't do that but once you've made a decision commit and move
31:05
on just remember that at the end of the day no matter what happens or what details you disagree on you have the
31:12
same ultimate goal right you both want the startup to succeed you're on the same team yeah and you're doing
31:18
something very very hard and against the odds so you want to be marching in the same direction right so that wraps up
31:24
our talk hopefully you've gained either you know the desire to get a co-founder more clarity on who your co-founder
31:30
should be or maybe more insight on how to work together with your co-founder
