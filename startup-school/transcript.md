AirbnB
1:10
all right
1:11
so let's talk about airbnb um
1:14
one of the things that i think is really
1:16
interesting to set this up is that
1:18
existing products did exist right airbnb
1:22
did not come up with this idea so what
Competition
1:24
were you using before airbnb to airbnb
1:26
dalton yeah um
1:29
for context i i think if you if you've
1:31
only seen airbnb you think they came up
1:33
with the idea that's probably if i if i
1:35
talk to my mom she'd say oh airbnb is a
1:36
great idea that those founders dreamed
1:38
up um but back in the day i was already
1:40
using vrbo
1:43
before airbnb was even funded by yc or
1:45
or existed there was also a very popular
1:48
startup called couchsurfing which was
1:51
quite similar to airbnb and it had a lot
1:53
of mind share
1:54
had a lot of it was a big network and so
1:57
it kind of felt like
1:59
the third-rate entrant
2:01
to a crowded space at the time i
2:04
remember when they were nyc that was my
2:05
perspective do you remember that michael
2:07
how'd you use any of those because i'd
2:09
use vrbo personally and i thought i had
2:10
used vrbo i had also used couchsurfing
2:14
um
2:14
one of the reasons why i was actually
2:16
excited about working with the airbnb
2:17
folks was because using couchsurfing was
2:20
so painful
2:22
and so
2:23
i think that you know first thing when
2:25
it comes to timing i think they nailed
2:26
this hardcore they weren't first
2:30
but the existing products weren't great
2:32
and i think it's interesting to talk
2:34
about why the existing products weren't
2:36
great because
2:38
honestly
2:40
that's important i would argue that like
2:42
there were two fundamental facts that
2:45
made the existing products not good
Payments
2:47
the first is that vrbo and craigslist
2:50
did not facilitate payments
2:52
so when you arranged in
2:54
a house share with someone or staying in
2:56
someone's apartment you still had to pay
2:58
them either in cash or check or wire
3:01
and there was a lot of friction because
3:02
there's two people who don't know each
3:04
other having to trust each other to
3:06
transmit payments
3:07
i think the second problem that vrbo had
Free listing
3:11
was they charge hosts to list
3:14
and if you think about the core insight
3:16
of this market it's that hosts are the
3:18
game if you can get the most hosts you
3:20
win you have the best inventory but if
3:22
you charge them up run to be on your
3:25
site uh like you're probably doing it
3:27
wrong
3:28
so to me
3:31
timing was huge existing product did not
3:33
there were 10x improvements that can be
3:34
made and the second thing that was
Solving their own problem
3:37
really interesting was that um
3:40
they were solving their own problem
3:43
like most people don't realize that
3:45
airbnb started because
3:47
joe and nate needed to make rent money
3:50
and there was a big conference going on
3:52
in san francisco and they basically
3:54
rented out room on their floor
3:56
to host people so that they could make
3:58
some money
3:59
and it's funny because we always talk
4:00
about personal problems but like
4:02
not being able to pay rent that's like
4:04
that's a real problem right
4:08
and that doesn't sound like a vacation
4:09
rental which was what i was used to
4:11
seeing uh on vrbo which was vacation
4:14
rentals exactly exactly i think it was
4:17
interesting at the time that a lot of
4:19
people realized that they could use
4:21
their property to make extra money and
4:23
it's not a coincidence that this
4:24
happened around the same time as the oa
4:26
crash where a lot of people needed to
4:29
make an extra buck and suddenly they
4:31
realized oh i have an asset right now i
4:33
can make some money on then i think the
Used their own product
4:35
last thing is
4:36
they used their own product airbnb
4:40
didn't realize the insight around
4:42
facilitating payments around accepting
4:44
payment when they launched
What were the takeaways when they launched?
4:46
they didn't have an insight when they
4:47
launched you know brian came and spoke
4:49
to yc recently and he shared the story
4:51
that when he used his own product and he
4:52
forgot to bring money for payment
4:55
and the host thought he was a fraud
4:57
he realized oh crap like our site needs
5:00
to allow people to pay like we have to
5:02
solve this problem
5:03
so
Criticisms
5:04
it's funny because these insights seems
5:07
obvious
5:08
now but dalton back in the day you know
5:11
put your investor hat on what were the
5:13
[ __ ] takes like why did everyone think
5:15
oh this is a dumb this is dumb oh look
5:17
there's two extremes one was
5:19
renting a house when someone is already
5:21
home renting a room in a house with a
5:23
hoster there
5:24
was like the ultimate unappealing scary
5:28
bad thing that no one wanted to do
5:30
especially
5:32
older folks you know like investor folks
5:34
like investor types
5:36
you know you have a lot of money and can
5:38
afford nice hotels you want to go stay
5:40
in a stranger's apartment in manhattan
5:42
like no thank you right so it was
5:44
extremely unappealing idea of people
5:46
worried about
5:48
those sorts of things
5:50
um
5:51
and then like the other
5:53
the other insight i have for you on this
5:54
one is
5:57
it was seen as uncool and impure
6:01
when you're building the community at
6:03
this time in history to charge money for
6:05
it
6:07
like the couchsurfing ethos was it was a
6:10
very like communal
6:12
community based pay it forward
6:15
social collective action
6:18
decentralized goodness
6:21
thing
6:22
and to be commercial
6:24
was extremely in poor taste and remember
6:26
michael you and i both were the founders
6:28
of this era
6:29
all of the messaging that was bombarded
6:31
from us from everyone all of our peers
6:34
is that making money isn't cool and
6:36
being commercial isn't cool and what
6:37
they should have done
6:38
is get as big as they could and and get
6:41
100 million people on airbnb and then
6:43
charge once they built the network and
6:45
so to charge
6:47
that's a horrible idea guys build a
6:49
network first and then charge right like
6:51
again you went through this as a founder
6:52
man isn't this what
6:53
you would have been told
6:55
it's it's what we were told i mean
6:57
twitch became big
7:00
when we started diversifying our
7:02
business model and it started accepting
7:03
direct payments from users in addition
7:05
to
7:06
ads but that was seen as
7:08
dumb back then
7:10
so
7:10
clearly and of course this is going to
7:12
be a common theme if they had listened
7:14
to most of the investors
7:16
or most of the founders at the time
7:19
airbnb wouldn't exist yeah it'd be like
7:21
well couchsurfing is free so your plan
7:22
is to build something like couchsurfing
7:26
but with no users and you're just
7:27
starting and you're going to charge
7:28
money for it good luck that sounds like
7:31
a suicide mission
7:33
right all right so so the next one is
Coinbase
7:35
coinbase so set the scene for coinbase
7:38
what do you think brian saw when he was
7:40
getting rolling
7:42
yeah so i was around
7:44
back then and i was trying to buy
Buying Bitcoin
7:46
bitcoin back then too and i remember um
7:49
the coinbase yc application really well
7:51
in the whole historical context so to
7:52
set this up for people
7:55
circa 2011
7:56
2012 it was really hard to buy bitcoin
8:01
really hard i remember looking into it
8:04
around 2011 and there was a step of
8:06
sending money orders like going to
8:08
western union and sending a money order
8:10
to some foreign country and that's when
8:12
i opted out of it i wish i would have
8:14
done it would have made a lot of money
8:15
but i didn't because it just seemed too
8:17
much like a total scam like if you ever
8:19
sending money orders to foreign
8:20
countries something is going wrong in
8:22
your life right um but anyway
8:24
i also um was familiar with mountain gox
8:27
and mount gox was a was the biggest and
8:29
largest bitcoin exchange back in the day
8:32
and um
8:34
it went down a lot and got hacked and
8:36
everyone lost all their money i actually
8:37
lost some money at mount cox personally
8:38
um i think i had about one bitcoin in
8:40
mount cox
8:42
i'm not too worried about it um i feel
8:44
like the reputation for mount gox was
8:46
like you can get money in
8:48
but you can't ever get any money back
8:50
out
8:52
that was the environment where
8:55
is that
8:56
was an acronym that was magic that
8:58
gathering online online exchange it was
9:00
originally a website to trade magic
9:02
cards that they pivoted into into
9:03
bitcoin and so anyway
9:05
um the historical insight was buying
9:07
bitcoin was something people wanted to
9:09
do
9:10
but all of the options were pretty bad
9:12
that's the historical context and brian
9:14
wanted to fix that
9:16
i think what's really
9:17
interesting about this is we come back
9:20
towards he wasn't the first mover
Not the first mover
9:24
was not the first mover but the product
9:26
that existed was so bad that a 10x
9:28
better product was actually within reach
9:30
like it was actually possible i think
9:32
the other fun insight here is that like
Online gold is 10x better than gold
9:35
portable online gold
9:38
is valuable like it is 10x better than
9:41
gold
9:42
and so as something you might want to
9:44
have
9:45
if you think gold is something that you
9:46
might want to own and it seems like the
9:47
market does like owning gold portable
9:50
online gold
9:52
strictly better
Criticisms
9:54
so i think
9:56
out of maybe all three of these founders
9:58
brian
10:00
was exposed to the most [ __ ] takes the
10:02
most
10:03
people saying this was not gonna work so
10:05
break that down first like explain all
10:07
the reasons why coinbase is not supposed
10:09
to work and brian should not be a
10:10
successful founder today
10:12
well at the time um
10:15
people saw bitcoin as a tiny market that
10:17
it was going to crash that it was a
10:19
bubble um investor didn't like it it was
10:21
synonymous with a lot of you know actual
10:23
fraud right didn't didn't have a great
10:25
reputation
10:27
also getting a bank deal was impossible
10:28
it's not like other founders didn't want
10:30
to start something like coinbase uh
10:32
us-based exchanges were incredibly hard
10:34
to start and this is the reason why all
10:36
the exchanges at the time were offshore
10:38
was uh the regulatory environments were
10:40
different in different places right
10:43
another thing i want to note is even
10:44
brian in his yc application
10:47
didn't really believe
10:49
in his own idea because what he
10:51
basically applied to yc with was um
10:54
the p2p transfer parts it wasn't buying
10:56
bitcoin and holding it it was the idea
10:59
that he could build something like
11:00
paypal to do p2p transfers and that the
11:03
the buying bitcoin part but that was
11:04
just part of it and so isn't it funny
11:06
that
11:07
even he
Undercounted
11:09
kind of under accounted
11:11
the simple promise of buying bitcoin in
11:14
a non-sketchy way with a debit card in
11:16
the us
11:17
and not getting hacked and losing all
11:18
your money
11:20
that was enough that was enough of an
11:21
insight to be the basis for like a
11:23
hundred billion dollar company he didn't
11:24
need to do all this other stuff
11:26
but
11:29
and following the pattern
11:31
a valuable insight that he learns after
11:33
starting the company right like you
11:35
don't have to have all the valuable
11:37
insights before you start
11:39
well you remember what the coinbase
11:40
product was back in the day right it was
11:42
a website
11:43
you logged in
11:46
you put in how much bitcoin you wanted
11:47
to buy
11:48
and you push the button and you bought
11:50
it and that that was you could sell it
11:51
too there was no there was no social
11:53
network there was no comment fee you
11:55
know it was probably
11:57
the simplest products
11:59
there were no graphs
12:01
it was one of the simplest products i've
12:03
ever seen
12:04
yeah
12:05
but it's because it solved the right
12:06
some single problem at the time
12:09
and and i think that the way that this
Impossible time raising money on demo day
12:11
is kind of embodied was that
12:13
uh fully embodied how bad of an idea
12:15
people thought this was is that he had a
12:17
impossible time raising money on demo
12:18
day
12:19
and so if he had taken the demo day
12:22
signal the investor signal of oh we
12:23
don't want to give you money
12:25
and quit
12:27
we don't have coinbase
12:28
correct
12:30
all right last one
Stripe
12:32
stripe
12:33
so um
12:34
you had dabbled with payments
12:37
um pre-stripe how easy was it
Context
12:41
to accept credit cards online
12:42
pre-striped tell yeah share the story
12:44
with everyone i have set up before
12:46
stripe existed i set up um accepting
12:49
credit cards from for my companies twice
12:51
once in
12:53
2002 or so believe it or not when i was
12:55
very young and then once again um
12:58
in 2007 and to get a merchant credit
13:02
card account um
13:04
was like applying for a mortgage you had
13:06
to fill out lots of paper
13:08
you had to fax in stuff you had to
13:09
personally guarantee things they had to
13:11
do fraud checks on you
13:13
it was rough it was expensive there was
13:15
minimums and so it's a possible thing to
13:18
do
13:19
but i would call it gnarly and
13:22
the opposite of easy in every way okay
13:24
and so that was so and i also remember
13:26
when strike came out i was actually in
13:28
the strike beta i was one of the first
13:29
hundred customers of strike way back in
13:31
the day for my cup for my third company
13:33
the third time i want to accept credit
13:34
cards and um
13:36
i really wanted it
13:38
in terms of make something people want
13:40
when it came out
13:42
and i read about it on hacker news i
13:44
immediately wanted strike
13:46
and i hadn't even seen it yet i just
13:47
knew i wanted it
13:48
so that that's a historical context
13:50
you know it's funny we were
13:51
authorized.net users too um at justintv
13:54
and twitch and
13:57
perfect example again of like a taste of
14:00
the good stuff but so hard to you it
14:03
took us three months to start accepting
14:06
credit cards i think there was a 30-page
14:08
contract that we had to read and figure
14:10
out a sign and it was like wow so once
14:12
again not first mover
Peer problem
14:14
i think another really interesting thing
14:16
about stripe was that
14:17
it was a problem that they saw their
14:19
peers in yc have
14:21
so literally they were seeing all of
14:23
their friends in yc not like going
14:25
through all of the pain of
14:27
authorized.net and they were hearing
14:28
this story over and over again
14:30
and then you know that's a good hint for
14:32
people out there looking for ideas like
14:33
if all of your smart technical friends
14:35
are complaining about the same thing
14:38
maybe
14:39
it's a real problem
14:41
now last insight that i think that they
Go-to-market
14:43
had
14:44
talk to me about
14:46
their go to market and specifically
14:48
about
14:49
understanding that their customers were
14:51
developers and not business guys because
14:53
i think that was revolutionary at the
14:55
time
14:56
yeah the the really clever
15:00
brand promise or marketing stance or
15:02
whatever you want to call it they had
15:04
was to try to make the most beautiful
15:06
website they could with the most
15:08
beautiful documentation
15:10
that was every you know programmers
15:14
dream like they they constantly ask
15:17
themselves and push themselves to say
15:18
what would i want or what would it what
What would a programmer want?
15:20
would a programmer want and this is so
15:22
different than every other
15:24
processing company because it was built
15:26
for basically business people like the
15:28
customer was not the the programmer who
15:30
had to implement authorize.net was not
15:32
the customer it was like some
15:34
someone getting paid you know 20 bucks
15:36
an hour or something to
15:38
to implement the code whereas this was
15:40
like they went nuts
15:43
at making something that developers
15:44
would just freak out about and everyone
15:46
copied it by the way every developer
15:48
would copy the stripe documentation copy
15:50
the stripe website it was like
15:52
the apple it was it was like if steve
15:54
jobs had to design
15:56
a payments
15:57
company it would be stripe and i think
16:00
they totally did this on purpose but
16:01
what this created is a lot of
16:03
buzz on hacker news and around nerds
16:07
basically that
16:09
hey have you seen the stripe thing oh
16:10
are you in the band also they did a beta
16:12
invite program
16:13
and so there was a it was a hot
16:15
commodity to be able to get into stripe
16:17
and be able to use it you were seen
16:19
as well connected if you got the the
16:22
pleasure of getting to use stripe it was
16:24
like a favor they were doing you to use
16:25
their product that's how that's how
16:27
that's what a great job they did in
16:29
making the website and documentation
16:30
excellent
16:31
what i love is that when the
16:33
strikefounders came to speak at yc the
16:35
other detail they added was it was the
Most expensive product
16:38
most expensive product in the market
16:41
like to make sure people really wanted
16:43
it they didn't give it away for free
16:45
they didn't price it comparably they
16:46
made it more expensive and people were
16:48
still desperate to use it like that's
16:50
how you know you have an insight like
16:52
when you're the most expensive thing
16:53
speaking of apple and people still are
16:56
desperate for it now the [ __ ] takes
Criticisms
16:58
right the [ __ ] takes were pretty clear
16:59
one what are two teenagers doing in the
17:02
banking space the right government
17:04
regulation it's the most regulated space
17:05
in the [ __ ] world right isn't this
17:07
like a suicide mission you're like hi
17:08
we're 19. um
17:11
we want to start basically a bank
17:13
give us all your money like we're gonna
17:15
we're gonna we're gonna handle hundreds
17:16
of millions of dollars of everyone's
17:18
money so yeah that's our plan and there
17:20
will be no fraud like we're good
17:23
i think the second one is that
17:25
even subtracting the regulation they
17:27
needed a bank deal they needed wells
17:29
fargo to let them start using their
17:31
rails well like as an early stage
17:33
startup they need to get that which at
17:35
the time seemed impossible
17:37
and then of course i think the last one
17:39
is that like
17:40
you know paypal existed there was a
17:42
really popular company where it felt
17:45
like paypal was like a quarter step away
17:49
from this right and it was like oh
17:51
even if you start doing well paypal can
17:53
go here instantly they have all these
17:54
users they're the hot company
17:57
yeah it was seen as a crowded market
17:59
with huge companies with hundreds of
18:01
employees thousands of employees and
18:03
it's the classic thing again the knock
18:05
against yc companies at the time is why
18:07
c would just fund
18:08
crappy versions of existing company like
18:11
the third-rate knock-off version of
18:13
something actually good was what yc
18:14
companies were isn't that hilarious i
18:16
don't know if people remember that but
18:17
that was the reputation of yc companies
18:19
is like oh yeah
18:21
they'll take a existing idea that's good
18:24
and they'll make like a less popular
18:26
version of it which which kills me
18:29
because like
18:30
in all three of these cases these folks
18:32
had the problem they had experience and
18:35
in hindsight there was an obvious
18:36
opportunity to make something 10x better
18:39
but
18:40
most people thought they were idiots and
18:43
that's probably the overarching theme
18:45
they had to be contrarian
Contrarian
18:47
to walk down this path because if they
18:49
had asked
18:50
10 startup experts 10 investors 10
18:53
fellow founders eight of them would have
18:55
told them that they were stupid
18:58
and like they had to build good products
They had to build great good products
19:00
like you can't take for granted you
19:02
can't we can't you know talk on a
19:04
whiteboard and plan our strategy and win
19:07
all of these founders had to actually do
19:09
it and the doing it part was the hard
19:12
part
19:13
yes
19:13
right like all these people had to
19:15
execute and build a product that people
19:17
loved and actually worked and all these
19:18
people built products that handled
19:20
hundreds of millions of dollars and they
19:21
couldn't lose the money
19:23
right so the actual execution bits
19:26
talk is cheap execution's hard
19:28
execution's expensive they all these
19:30
folks had to execute
19:32
so i think what the takeaway here is
Takeaway
19:35
if we can sum this up
19:36
one you shouldn't give a [ __ ] if there's
Incumbents
19:38
an existing product in the market
19:40
if you're a user of that product or your
19:42
friends or users of that product and
19:43
they all hate it and you should not give
19:45
a [ __ ]
19:47
um two
Don't care about experts
19:49
you should not give a [ __ ] if most of
19:51
the people around you who you believe
Market Research
19:53
are experts
19:55
don't think this is a good idea
19:57
especially you shouldn't care if they're
20:00
not going to be users if they have no
20:02
experience with the pain of using the
20:04
existing product and then three
Market math
20:09
be very careful about your initial
20:11
market math be very careful about
20:14
pretending that you know how big the
20:16
market could be it turns out with so
20:17
many of these transformational
20:18
technologies there are use cases you
20:21
can't dream of that once you build a 10x
20:23
better product other people will do
20:26
and so
20:27
each and every time these founders were
20:29
presenting oh we have a market size of
20:31
blank the next time they raised money
20:33
they could say actually we made a
20:34
mistake the market size is actually
20:36
bigger we didn't think of this we didn't
20:38
think of that and so don't be
20:39
discouraged if someone's like that's a
20:41
tiny market that's kind of a [ __ ]
20:44
um thing that would have killed all
20:45
these companies
20:47
all right talk to you later man
