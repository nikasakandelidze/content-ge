Technical co-founder vs. Dev shops
12:38
really think seriously about getting a technical co-founder and one of the most common questions we get from non-technical co-founders is I can't
12:45
find a technical co-founder what should I do can't I just hire a Dev shop to help me build out my product the short
12:51
answer is please don't do that like if you really can't find a technical co-founder you should learn how to code
12:57
Dev shops pose a ton of challenges especially for really early stage
13:02
companies you know not only are they costly from day one but it can be extremely challenging to iterate quickly
13:08
as you're learning from your users you know Dev shops are designed to ship clear deliverables and as an early stage
13:15
startup like you don't have a clear deliverable like you're kind of like feeling around in the dark and building
13:21
for your users and the requirements are changing on the Fly they also don't care about your user they're just like I'm
13:26
gonna do this thing you're gonna pay me exactly and um you know iteration can just become really clunky ineffective
13:33
and again very expensive um so in short a technical co-founder is a an amazing investment early on if you
Trial projects
13:40
can find one the last thing I want to bring up in this section about evaluating co-founders is trial projects
13:45
the only way to tell if you work well together with someone is to try working together so Atco funer matching we
13:52
recommend that before jumping into a full-blown co-founder relationship you work on a trial project together first essentially you agree beforehand on a
13:59
timeline usually two to four weeks a tangible project goal and scope and also who owns the work at the end it's a very
14:05
structured way to try working together with some mutual expectations I do want to say though remember at the end of the
14:10
day just like with any other risks you take in life you will eventually need to take a leap of faith and that's
14:16
especially true when you're starting a startup which is risky in all sorts of ways so find someone you're willing to
14:21
take a leap of faith with yeah absolutely and you know we talk a little bit about like de-risking things and
14:26
like a lot of these questions we talked about earlier are ways to de-risk that co-founder relationship but again like do risk it until the point you can and
14:33
then and then you just gotta go so let's say you found someone you want to work with you know using co-founder matching
14:38
or one of these other ways we talked about so now I want to move on to an important topic which is how to split
Spliting equity
14:44
Equity with your co-founders so the general YC advice is that by default you should just split Equity equally so
14:49
there's lots of options here but you can kind of start from that Baseline and the reason for this is because you know you
14:55
would like to be making equal contributions going forward and you should both be equally motivated to work
15:01
hard for a very long time you should value your co-founder and if you don't like why are they your co-founder but
15:07
the Divya I came up with the idea okay ideas don't matter um ideas are cheap right and if things
15:13
go well first of all the idea is very likely to change over time is you listen to your users but if things go well
15:19
you're going to be working together on this for the next seven to ten years or more or more exactly so you know the
15:26
point in time that you came up with the idea is just such a small part of my idea right that makes sense to me so
15:31
here are some other really common bad reasons we hear for splitting co-founder Equity unequally so of course I came up
15:38
with the idea I started working on this idea before my co-founder did my co-founder took a salary and I didn't
15:43
I'm older and I'm more experienced than my co-founder we need someone to tie break when we have arguments so there is
15:50
a good point here about needing a tiebreaker but we'll talk about that in a second it doesn't need to be done through Equity exactly I launched my MVP
15:56
without my co-founder my co-founder agreed to their smaller share another one is you know I raise so many thousand
16:03
dollars before my co-founder joined so even if you think you got a good deal now this could potentially result in
16:08
resentment later down the line yeah you shouldn't be trying to get a good deal from your co-founder like it kind of starts the relationship off on a bad
16:13
foot yeah so the bottom line here is all of the work is still ahead of you you
16:19
both need to be happy and motivated for a long long time startup outcomes are pretty bimodal so don't jeopardize your
16:26
co-founding relationship over a few percents alright so we've talked about how to get set up with a founding team it is time to get to work now we're
How to work together
16:33
going to share some stories and best practices on how to work with your co-founders when it comes to teamwork one thing we often hear is that
16:40
communication is extremely important Divya do you have any advice for our Founders on how to keep clear and open
16:45
lines of communication yeah this is a great question so communication is so important and it's as important as it is
16:51
in any close relationship in your life so we talked about this earlier but you know a co-founder relationship is it's
16:57
not a stretch to think of it as a marriage yeah and I imagine that setting up these communication channels starts
17:02
very early in the relationship like almost before you start working together you need to align on certain
17:07
expectations right I've seen co-founders enter into relationships with very different pictures of what it looks like
17:14
to her together from anything from you know how many hours you worked or how much salary you're going to draw to how
17:20
many meetings a week you plan to have you're so right cat talking about expectations is one of the first ways to
17:26
really test out your communication with your co-founder and make sure that you can actually have hard or uncomfortable
17:31
conversations while still being productive so at my first startup we initially had four Founders um all
17:37
friends still friends still friends still still very good friends um and there were a couple of topics
17:43
that we should have discussed early on that just became bigger problems later than they needed to be
17:49
um so first we found out pretty early on about six months in that one of our co-founders he kind of had a timeline in
17:54
his mind for how long he would wait for the product to go viral um it was a totally reasonable
18:00
expectation but it's not something we'd really discuss so about six months into our startup Journey he was getting very
18:05
frustrated with the lack of traction and um it kind of caught us all by surprise
18:10
since we hadn't talked about it and you know it was something that just kind of built up over over time and he left the
18:16
company pretty abruptly another topic that we should have discussed earlier was about finances and how long we could
18:23
each afford to go with little to no salary so there was a little bit of a mismatch with the founders on this of course everyone's financial situation is
18:29
different this put a little bit of unexpected pressure on the company at some at one point it kind of came out of
18:34
nowhere it felt like it came out of nowhere we ended up feeling like we needed to raise we started considering some like low ball Aqua higher offers
18:42
um and while we didn't end up taking any of these deals I think if we'd known sooner we probably could have made some
18:47
decisions earlier on to avoid these distractions and so just these conversations would have been really helpful to have had up front gotcha yeah
18:54
these scenarios seem pretty common absolutely and it'd be really helpful to discuss these things in advance do you
Topics to discuss before committing
18:59
have a list of topics you recommend that Founders discuss with their co-founders before committing yeah so this list is
19:05
by no means exhaustive but here are some good ones to start the conversation so one is um how much do you want to
19:12
work on your startup versus not we talked about this earlier but um you know evenings weekends vacations like
19:18
kind of what are those expectations what do you guys both have in your minds it can be pretty different they can be very different sometimes people just assume
19:25
and don't have the conversation just like don't assume you know put it out there um what is being available and like what
19:31
do response times look like like you know if I slack you and you write back to me six hours later like am I gonna be frustrated or am I gonna think you're
19:37
really responsive like you know people have different senses of this how long can each of us go without salary or
19:44
benefits again this is a very important one to talk about and what do each of you need to see at different Milestones
19:50
to keep working on it and to stay motivated does anyone have a it needs to be working by X date
19:55
um and if so like what does working look like yeah this is such great advice I can definitely see how misalignments on
20:01
these expectations can start small but really Fester into resentment over time absolutely aside from aligning on
Building trust
20:08
expectations we hear that building trust is another key element of a co-founder relationship
20:13
I've personally seen this at the root of lots of relationship issues not just for co-founders but for friendships family
20:19
relationships Etc we see co-founder breakups all the time at YC and a lot of them stem from a lack of trust that
20:25
grows out of control Divya how has trust played a role in your co-founder relationship yeah so trust is a really
20:32
big one one of the things I haven't mentioned until now is that for both my startups one of my co-founders is my
20:38
husband still still my husband you're gonna ask um and for my second company he was my
20:44
only co-founder it was just the two of us and one of the reasons we were able to make decisions so quickly and draw
20:51
such clear lines of ownership was that we already had so much trust built up from being married but also from having
20:57
run a company together earlier um you know of course not everyone comes in with this much underlying trust but
21:03
having that trust made the co-founder relationship very very functional I think previously existing relationships
21:10
with your co-founders could go both ways right of course personal relationships don't always translate into functional
21:16
co-founder relationships yeah that's 100 True a previously existing personal relationship
21:22
um could totally go both ways um and let me give you an example of one that did not go so well so
21:28
um last batch last YC batch we had a company apply um we we thought the founder was great
21:34
and we said why don't you come back with a co-founder and so um he went and he found a friend as someone who he'd been
21:39
very good friends with for a long time they hadn't worked together he convinced him to join the companies they came back they started the batch
21:45
um the CEO had been running the company for about six months and to him it really felt like his company oh no yeah
21:51
yeah so he brought in this friend and from day one he just kind of micromanaged him and didn't give him
21:58
enough space to succeed or fail at the projects He was responsible for and this is an important one right he would kind
22:04
of jump in before the project had time to work because at a startup like things take time right and everyone needs a
22:11
little bit of space and they need that trust um and so he would jump in and he would just kind of berate his co-founder when
22:17
things were starting to go wrong and when you trust someone like you give them this room to fail right and the
22:24
psychological safety to make mistakes in this case the co-founder relationship ended with the two so you know we got a
22:30
slack message one morning and they were like the two of us we were in a bar midnight last night with a bunch of our friends the CEO was like berating his
22:38
co-founder and then you know the co-founder resigned abruptly the next morning so it's just not a good situation that sounds really rough yeah
22:45
I would not want to be in a situation like that we do have a couple tips to help with building trust so number one
22:51
is is trust people by default trust them until they lose your trust not vice
22:56
versa a lot of good Founders tell us they do this because when you operate the other way around like in the example
23:01
Olivia just gave people end up feeling micromanaged they feel not trusted and all this negativity will continue to
23:07
build up if you say you're gonna do something do it if you're not gonna get it done that's fine like startups run
23:13
super fast you will often have more things than you can finish on your plate but if you're not going to do it you
23:18
should communicate early often and honestly create space for mistakes you are going to make mistakes all the time
23:25
both you and your co-founder so don't say things like I told you so it's important to learn from mistakes
23:31
together rather than assigning blame when something goes wrong and lastly the more time you can spend physically
23:37
together the better this lowers the friction to asking questions talking about the little things and that can
23:42
expedite making progress on both your startup and your relationship communicating in person can also help
23:48
you learn or get a better understanding for the way your co-founders and that can help you build trust as
23:53
well thanks Kat those are great and um you know they can kind of build a really
23:58
good foundation for building a trusting relationship um so in addition to that underlying trust that you're going to be
How to setup for quick decision making
24:04
continually working at um there might need to be some structural roles and responsibilities that are defined to keep decision making
24:11
really fast so on my first company we made the mistake of trying to keep everything equal
24:17
um and there are many of you there are four of us yeah um so you know we talked earlier about how splitting Equity equally is a good
24:24
idea and like totally agree with that the equity was not the problem the first kind of yellow flag that came up was
24:29
that we decided to not have any titles like we all called ourselves co-founder um and so in and of itself that wasn't
24:36
really a problem but there's kind of two issues with this one is as it correlated that we tried to make all of our
24:42
decisions by consensus consensus meaning you all had to agree on the decision to move forward yeah for like any decision
24:49
um so I don't think I need to go into it with this group on my why that's a bad idea but at the time it felt really equal and it felt Equitable but also the
24:56
the fact that we had no type no titles was a little bit of a yellow flag because it was an early indicator that
25:01
the team couldn't have hard conversations and we couldn't make decisions when there was disagreement
25:07
right and so it was like the consensus and the lack of titles were like both kind of symptoms of the same thing you
25:13
know having to make decisions by consensus was ultimately disastrous like we would just spin we would get stuck in gridlock
25:19
um so let's talk about some ways to protect against this so you all don't repeat my mistake yeah so as Divya mentioned having clear titles or at
25:26
least naming one person the CEO can certainly help none of this co-ceo stuff it helps break ties and disagreement and
25:33
it's also just really good practice for having hard conversations where two people may not agree not being able to
25:38
pick a CEO could be a sign that you're not able to make hard decisions together in addition to titles it's important to
25:45
establish a few other things that can help with decision making so clear areas of ownership within the company who is
25:50
the final decision maker for different types of decisions this could be a different person in different functions but it's important to know who it is
25:57
what happens if the other person degrees disagrees slightly versus strongly maybe
26:02
the way you deal with it is different in those cases and finally it can be helpful to set up a structure for
26:07
accountability so once you've made your decision at some point you should check back in to see how that decision played
26:13
out and whether anything needs to change in the process moving forward clear areas of ownership are very very
26:18
important in a startup and a business and in addition in order to make that work it's also very important to
Personality and communication styles
26:24
understand each other's personality and communication Styles and so you know here are some tips on that so one is
26:30
keep keep an eye on your on each other's mental health right like likely neither of you is a mental health professional
26:35
or anything like that but you can kind of see some early indicators is your co-founder burning out are they taking care of themselves are they starting to
26:41
kind of become more reactive or more emotional like these are some things to look out for and catch early related
26:47
know how each of you reacts when you're under stress or or when you're having a
26:52
tough conversation cat let me ask you a question when you're in a stressful tough conversation do you tend to attack
26:58
or retreat I get very aggressive when I feel upset so I would say attack yeah
27:05
same um I am I'm in the same boat and um this is something that I assumed was the case
27:11
for everyone but it's not right like people have very different personality types I've been in a few um close professional relationships or
27:17
co-founder relationships if I'm very frustrated I like you I get very spun up like I get very communicative
27:22
communicative I crave engagement you want to solve the problem right now exactly like I want to get in like right
27:28
now right now right it might not always be a good idea right like we might be emotional but I'm still like I wanna I wanna get through this and I've worked
27:34
with people that in those situations like they just kind of want to withdraw a little bit like they want to cool down
27:40
maybe they don't want to engage with me because I'm being crazy um right but like people sometimes just
27:45
want like a little bit of time to calm down and I think sometimes when there's a mismatch in these Styles it can create
27:50
a little bit of a vicious cycle it can self-perpetuate the more you want to talk to them the more they are not
27:56
trying to talk to you right now right and I might perceive that they don't care about the problem um so it's just important to know how
28:02
people react in stress a few other things so does your co-founder tend to speak up when they see a small problem
28:07
or do they bottle it up until there's a huge frustration it's important to know how big of a deal things are when someone brings things up what
28:14
environments are most comfortable for your co-founder to voice concerns is it you know like a walk and talk is it
28:20
maybe over a meal is it in a scheduled structured one-on-one where there's time set aside for concerns here's one that
28:26
might be a little bit counter-intuitive but are you both comfortable praising each other and celebrating each other's wins this can actually be very
28:32
uncomfortable for people sometimes can you you know give each other positive feedback and can you graciously accept positive feedback like this can really
28:39
build a strong co-founder relationship and lastly will you feel attacked if your co-founder makes a suggestion about
28:45
your work because as we talked about everyone's going to make a lot of mistakes right and everyone needs to be able to talk about these in a way that
28:52
isn't emotionally loaded so figure out what that looks like for you um and can you do it without taking it personally I
28:58
definitely have an aggressive personal type when I'm stressed so this is all really really helpful stuff to think
29:03
about let's wrap up by talking about a few habits and structures you can put in place to try to build and Foster a
Useful habits for a productive relationship
29:09
productive co-founder relationship number one have regularly scheduled one-on-ones even if you talk to each
29:14
other all the time it can also be helpful to keep a list of ongoing topics that you add to as you think of things
29:19
and if there's something non-urgent just you know add it to the list instead of interrupting your co-founder every time there's something small in those 101s
29:26
definitely Reserve time for bi-directional feedback both positive and constructive make this something
29:31
that's part of the flow make it routine not something that feels like a big deal that you dread all the time actually I
29:37
have a great example the founders from kiwi biosciences which I talked about earlier do something that I think is pretty cool when one person gives
29:43
constructive feedback the other person doesn't interrupt or argue it's a really neat way to let someone vent without
29:49
feeling like they have to defend why they feel upset and I think it also helps with feeling like it's okay to
29:55
talk about even the smallest things and that leads me to the next point which is don't delay hard conversations and don't
30:00
wait until things are a big problem before you mention them the thing with problems is that they're easier to solve
30:06
when they're small engage a coach or counselor for tricky interpersonal situations don't feel bad about this
30:12
this is really helpful I highly recommend it these coaches is literally their job to help people through these
30:18
problems they've seen it all and they can help you and again it doesn't mean you have a big problem because you're
30:23
engaging a coach right like you can you can tackle the problem while it's small and we've talked about this next one a couple times already but we do think
30:29
it's really important avoid personal statements and normalize failure we've said this multiple times failure is
30:35
going to happen all the time and you need to create space for that so don't say things like I told you so don't say
30:42
Hey you always do this you always XYZ these are personal attacks and you don't really want that in your co-founder
30:48
relationship argue and get comfortable arguing but you should know who ultimately is the decision maker
30:54
disagree and commit at some point your team will have to make a decision unless you're you know trying to to do the
31:00
consensus thing don't do that but once you've made a decision commit and move
31:05
on just remember that at the end of the day no matter what happens or what details you disagree on you have the
31:12
same ultimate goal right you both want the startup to succeed you're on the same team yeah and you're doing
31:18
something very very hard and against the odds so you want to be marching in the same direction right so that wraps up
31:24
our talk hopefully you've gained either you know the desire to get a co-founder more clarity on who your co-founder
31:30
should be or maybe more insight on how to work together with your co-founder
