Now suppose you have a startup idea and you want to know if it's good I'm going to give you a framework for this and the format of the framework is 10 key questions to ask about any startup idea.

So the first one is do you have founder market fit if I depict like one most important criteria it'd probably be this one and what I mean by founder market fit is just are you the right team to be working on this idea and a great example of what good founder market fit looks like is plan grid so plan grid makes an iPad app to view construction Blueprints and to the founders of plan grid were Tracy and Ralph and Tracy had worked in the construction industry and she knew a lot about construction and Ralph was an awesome developer who was like the perfect person to build this iPad out if you're going to imagine a team to start playing grid the team that you would imagine would look you know something like that and that's what good founder market fit looks like it's like this team is obviously the right team to work on the idea in fact founder market fit is so important that I would recast your search for a startup idea when most people go to pick a startup idea they try to look for a good startup idea like in the abstract and instead I would think about this exercise as an exercise to pick a good idea for your team you with me it doesn't matter if something is a good startup idea for someone else if it's not a good idea for your team so you may as well just look for ideas that you would actually be good at executing

okay number two how big is the market obviously you need a big Market which for startups typically means like a billion dollar market but actually less obviously there are two kinds of markets for startups that are good um ones that are big now and ones that are small but rapidly growing and an example of the second one is coinbase so when coinbase got started in 2012 the Bitcoin trading Market was minuscule but even at that time it was pretty obvious that if Bitcoin succeeded the way people hoped that it would that this would eventually be a billion dollar market 

number three how acute is this problem so as I said earlier the most common mistake is just like working on something that just isn't really a problem or it's just not a problem that people care enough about um here's an example of the opposite here's an example of what a good problem looks like Rex so Brax from Winter 2017 makes a credit card for startups and before brex if a startup NYC wanted a corporate credit card they literally could not get one because a no bank would give a credit card to a startup that's a good problem like if you're if the alternative to your solution is literally nothing that's what a good problem looks like

okay next do you have competition now most Founders think that if you have competition that that's bad but counter-intuitively it is the opposite most good startup ideas have competition but if you were going up against especially entrenched competition you typically need a new insight 

next one is like do you want this personally do you know people personally who want this it's amazing how often people start companies where the answer to both these questions is no if that's the case you definitely got to worry that you know maybe nobody wants this so definitely time to go talk to some users

Did this only recently become possible or only recently become necessary so something has recently changed in the world like a new technology regulatory change or a new problem that is often what creates a new opportunity and a great example of this is company called Checker which does background checks via VIA an API so it's an API for doing background checks on people and roughly the story of Checker is delivery services like doordash and instacart and Uber started to take off and they were all hiring huge pools of delivery people and workers and they needed to run background checks on all of these people and there were at the time already a bunch of large existing companies that run background checks but they weren't well suited for this very new use case and that is like exactly the kind of change in the world that creates a new opportunity

let's talk about proxies so a proxy is a large company that does something similar to your startup but it is not a direct competitor and so um a good example of this in practice is a company called rappi which does food delivery in Latin America and when rapping got started there were already a few delivery companies in other parts of the world like doordash they're doing very well they just hadn't caught on in Latin America yet and so doordash was a great proxy to show that this idea of doing food delivery in Latin America would probably work

is this an idea you'd want to work on for years but this is a tricky one like sure if the answer to this question is yes that's a good sign but often it's not often an idea grows on Founders over time as it starts to work as I'm going to talk about in a moment a lot of the best startup ideas are in boring spaces like tax accounting software or something like that like no one is particularly passionate about like nobody starts off being passionate about tax accounting software um but tax accounting software is probably a good business and if you're actually running a successful business you tend to become passionate about it over time 

okay is this a scalable business so if you're building pure software the answer is yes because software skills infinitely and you can just like check this one off um the place for Founders most often get into trouble here is with Services businesses like agencies or Dev shops anything that requires like high skill human labor in order to serve your customers 

okay and my last question is is this a good idea space which of course means I need to tell you what an idea space is this is a concept from my colleague Dalton who you'll hear from later in this course an idea space is like one level of abstraction out from a particular startup idea it is a class of closely related startup ideas like software for hospitals or infrastructure monitoring tools or food delivery services and here's the thing different idea spaces have wildly different hit rates over the last 10 years if you started a company that did like fintech infrastructure or vertical SAS for Enterprise the the probability that your company became a billion dollar company was astonishingly High whereas if you started something in consumer Hardware or social networks or ad Tech the success rate was like orders of magnitude lower and I can't say that that will continue to be the case for those specific areas because spaces flipped from hot to cold over time but it is still worth thinking about picking a good idea space and a good idea Space is really just one that like you expect is going to have a reasonable hit rate for new startup ideas and one that has founder market fit that way even if your initial idea isn't quite right there are probably good adjacent ideas that you can sort of like drift into I'm going to give a good example of like how this played out in practice so a good example of picking a good idea space is this company called 5tran from yc1213 and basically it's already 5tran is they started making this tool for data analysis and they went to some companies and they tried to sell it and the companies didn't want it so they pivoted and they built a different tool for data analysis and they went back to the same companies and they tried to sell them that one and the companies didn't want that either but each time they went to companies and tried to sell them some tool for data analysis they would learn more about what those companies actually wanted and So eventually they sort of stumbled into an actual problem into an actual tool for data analysis that companies actually wanted and this is why picking a good idea space to start with is so important like because the five Tran Founders were shopping for ideas and a fertile idea space they put themselves in a good position to like bump into a good startup idea if they
