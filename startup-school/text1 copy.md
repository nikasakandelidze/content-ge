## recipes for generating startups ideas







okay and my last recipe is to just like look for big industries that seem broken any Big Industry that seems broken is probably right for disruption 

and finally I've got kind of a bonus recipe which is to just find a co-founder that already has an idea they're actually like a lot of people just on Startup School co-founder matching right now that already have an idea and are looking for a co-founder so if you don't have a co-founder and you don't have an idea that could be a great hack to getting both 

at the same time the last point that I want to leave you with is just to remember that it's often hard to tell if a startup idea is good or not and so while I hope the concepts that I talked about here will help typically the only way to know for sure if your startup idea is good is to Just Launch it and find out so if after all this you've got a startup idea and you're still kind of on the fence about whether it's actually a good idea or not that is my advice for you just launch it and find it [Music] ",
