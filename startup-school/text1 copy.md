## recipes for generating startups ideas


so let's talk about some other ones the next recipe is to start with a problem you've personally encountered ideally one that you're in an unusual position to see so vetcove is a website for veterinarians to order supplies so you can think about it like amazon.com for vets and the short story of vetcove is that the founders are brothers and their dad is a veterinarian and growing up they would notice that the way he ordered supplies was like super old-fashioned like you'd have to like call up a supplier on the phone and like order stuff through like a 1-800 number or something it was like very obvious that you could build an amazon.com kind of thing that would replace that and I I love the story of vetcove because it's such a great example of what a great startup opportunity looks like because thousands of veterinarians must have known that this was a real problem that it was really annoying there wasn't like a basic website where you could just go to order supplies but the thing is veterinarians don't start Tech startups very often and then on the other hand you had like thousands of programmers in Silicon Valley who were begging their heads against sisps and tarpet ideas totally unaware that over here there was like a really great genuine problem to work on and because of this when the vetcove founders got started they had no competition so this amazing idea just got left on the table for years 

so if you want to try to actually use recipes one and two here's a specific set of instructions for how to do it this is advice I often give to Founders YC who are pivoting and who are looking for a new idea here's how it works for each founder on your team go through every job you've ever had plus all your internships plus like other life experiences and think really carefully about each of them what problems did you come across what did you learn that other people don't know What are problems or opportunities that you've been in kind of a special position to see those are the best places to start looking for startup ideas 

okay the next one is to just think of things you personally wish existed this is like a really classic recipe this is very common advice great example of this is doordash the short story of doordash is that the founders of doordash were undergrads at Stanford and the thing they really wanted was to be able to just order food from local restaurants and have it delivered to their dorm and before doordash you couldn't do that so they started doordash and this is a great recipe but this is the recipe that is most dangerous and potentially leading to tar pit ideas so if you're using this recipe you just gotta stop and think for a second is there a reason why this thing doesn't exist yet

okay the next one is to look for things in the world that have changed recently that might have created a new opportunity a great example of this is COVID so when the pandemic started it changed daily life for all of us and many Founders realize that this created the opportunity for new companies and some very successful startups came out of it and one of them is this company called gather town which builds like this fun way to hang out with other people online and the founders of gather town were actually working on a different idea that wasn't going so well and when the pandemic started they pivoted to this because it was obvious that like the change in behavior of the pandemic had created a bunch of new opportunities 

you can also look for companies that have been successful recently and look for new variants on them a good example of this is a company called Nuvocargo. Nuvocargo is a good example of explicitly sitting down to try to think about startup ideas and actually finding a good one which is the thing that I told you is hard to do pneumo cargo is basically flexport for Latin America they help U.S companies to import stuff from Mexico and the story of nuvocargo is that Deepak the founder was working on a different idea at YC and he realized that his idea wasn't going to work and he went on like a systematic search for better ideas and he picked Nuvocargo for for very analytical reasons he picked it because it was a large Market because they were good proxies from other companies flexport and he picked it even though he didn't have deep domain expertise in the import export space because he had some connections that would enable him to get started and he felt like he would just be very good at running this kind of operationally intensive business and that worked really well Nivocargo is doing super well 

you can also go and talk to people and just ask them what problems they have this this can work the the downside with this recipe is it actually requires a lot of skill if you want to do this I would recommend first picking a fertile idea space and then going and talking to people within that idea space and I would also recommend talking not just to potential customers but also to potent but also to founders of companies in that idea space to get advice about what ideas are actually worth pursuing and a good example of doing this successfully is AtoB and AtoB was in the position that a lot of Founders that struggle to find good startup ideas are in which is that the founders were pretty young and they hadn't acquired a lot of specific domain expertise like the resi founders had yet but they really wanted to do a startup and they wanted to do a startup that had like a genuinely good idea the way that they came up with the idea for AtoB was very systematic and so I'm going to walk you through how they did it and really break it down for you so AtoB makes fuel cards and if you haven't heard of a fuel card it's like a special kind of credit card for truck drivers when the AtoB Founders got into YC they pivoted and they spent the whole YC batch looking for a new idea and here's how they did it first they picked an idea space and the idea space that they picked was essentially software for the trucking industry and they picked this idea space despite not being experts at the trucking industry because they felt that it just should be a fertile idea space to go hunting for startup ideas the trucking industry is as like Big Industry hasn't been that disrupted by startups and software yet so they just felt like there were probably some good problems to work on in the trucking industry but the problem is they didn't know that much about the trucking industry so they didn't know what those problems were and so they decided that they would turn themselves into experts in the trucking industry and what they did is they actually physically drove two truck stops which were places where truck drivers are just kind of Milling about and they would just walk up to truck drivers and like start talking to them and ask them questions about what their problems were they also talked to a lot of Founders who had started companies in the trucking space to get ideas for what problems were actually worth working on they would basically talk to like anyone who knew anything about Trucking that was willing to talk to them and as they did that they began to put together like a mental map of the space and where the good ideas were where the bad ideas were and they actually went through a whole bunch of different potential ideas before eventually deciding to work on fuel cards and I love the example of AtoB Because AtoB is one of the best new ideas to come out of YC in several years AtoB is a phenomenal company and the approach that they used to find this idea is something that really anyone could do and most Founders don't do this because it just sounds like too much work so if you're willing to put in the work this is an amazing way to find a startup idea 

okay and my last recipe is to just like look for big industries that seem broken any Big Industry that seems broken is probably right for disruption 

and finally I've got kind of a bonus recipe which is to just find a co-founder that already has an idea they're actually like a lot of people just on Startup School co-founder matching right now that already have an idea and are looking for a co-founder so if you don't have a co-founder and you don't have an idea that could be a great hack to getting both 

at the same time the last point that I want to leave you with is just to remember that it's often hard to tell if a startup idea is good or not and so while I hope the concepts that I talked about here will help typically the only way to know for sure if your startup idea is good is to Just Launch it and find out so if after all this you've got a startup idea and you're still kind of on the fence about whether it's actually a good idea or not that is my advice for you just launch it and find it [Music] ",
