## recipes for generating startups ideas





you can also go and talk to people and just ask them what problems they have this this can work the the downside with this recipe is it actually requires a lot of skill if you want to do this I would recommend first picking a fertile idea space and then going and talking to people within that idea space and I would also recommend talking not just to potential customers but also to potent but also to founders of companies in that idea space to get advice about what ideas are actually worth pursuing and a good example of doing this successfully is AtoB and AtoB was in the position that a lot of Founders that struggle to find good startup ideas are in which is that the founders were pretty young and they hadn't acquired a lot of specific domain expertise like the resi founders had yet but they really wanted to do a startup and they wanted to do a startup that had like a genuinely good idea the way that they came up with the idea for AtoB was very systematic and so I'm going to walk you through how they did it and really break it down for you so AtoB makes fuel cards and if you haven't heard of a fuel card it's like a special kind of credit card for truck drivers when the AtoB Founders got into YC they pivoted and they spent the whole YC batch looking for a new idea and here's how they did it first they picked an idea space and the idea space that they picked was essentially software for the trucking industry and they picked this idea space despite not being experts at the trucking industry because they felt that it just should be a fertile idea space to go hunting for startup ideas the trucking industry is as like Big Industry hasn't been that disrupted by startups and software yet so they just felt like there were probably some good problems to work on in the trucking industry but the problem is they didn't know that much about the trucking industry so they didn't know what those problems were and so they decided that they would turn themselves into experts in the trucking industry and what they did is they actually physically drove two truck stops which were places where truck drivers are just kind of Milling about and they would just walk up to truck drivers and like start talking to them and ask them questions about what their problems were they also talked to a lot of Founders who had started companies in the trucking space to get ideas for what problems were actually worth working on they would basically talk to like anyone who knew anything about Trucking that was willing to talk to them and as they did that they began to put together like a mental map of the space and where the good ideas were where the bad ideas were and they actually went through a whole bunch of different potential ideas before eventually deciding to work on fuel cards and I love the example of AtoB Because AtoB is one of the best new ideas to come out of YC in several years AtoB is a phenomenal company and the approach that they used to find this idea is something that really anyone could do and most Founders don't do this because it just sounds like too much work so if you're willing to put in the work this is an amazing way to find a startup idea 

okay and my last recipe is to just like look for big industries that seem broken any Big Industry that seems broken is probably right for disruption 

and finally I've got kind of a bonus recipe which is to just find a co-founder that already has an idea they're actually like a lot of people just on Startup School co-founder matching right now that already have an idea and are looking for a co-founder so if you don't have a co-founder and you don't have an idea that could be a great hack to getting both 

at the same time the last point that I want to leave you with is just to remember that it's often hard to tell if a startup idea is good or not and so while I hope the concepts that I talked about here will help typically the only way to know for sure if your startup idea is good is to Just Launch it and find out so if after all this you've got a startup idea and you're still kind of on the fence about whether it's actually a good idea or not that is my advice for you just launch it and find it [Music] ",
