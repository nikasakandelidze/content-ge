How should the CEO set up a company?
5:01
how should the ceo set up a company so
5:04
that if this battle
5:06
you know if there is a co-founder fight
5:08
it's it's not fatal to the company the
5:10
closest to equal you can get the better
5:12
because it avoids this oh this person
5:14
has 10 percent more so it's their
5:15
company you see all this drama that
5:17
happens over equity split so
5:19
equal is good however here's a pro tip
5:22
for you
5:23
a straight 50 50 deadlock
5:26
is rough and we see that kill companies
5:28
a lot and so it might be reasonable
5:32
for the ceo to have one extra share
5:34
so you effectively have the same
5:36
ownership your equal co-founders but
5:38
that one extra share is you agreeing in
5:40
writing early that in the event of a
5:42
50-50 deadlock
5:46
there's a tiebreaker vote dalton before

Tactical tips for folks looking for co-founders?
5:49
what are some tactical tips you give
5:50
folks who are looking for co-founders
5:52
now who are extremely early in their
5:54
journey or thinking about starting a
5:55
company
5:57
i hear from a lot of folks starting
5:58
companies where they want to come up
5:59
with the idea first maybe they want to
6:01
raise money first and then they want to
6:03
add a co-founder and i actually think
6:05
that's going about it
6:07
in a less than ideal way and actually
6:09
might cause more problems okay i would
1. Team first
6:12
recommend figuring out who the
6:13
co-founder is first and then if you come
6:15
up with the idea together
6:17
and perhaps you fundraise together then
6:20
you'll have collective ownership that
6:21
it's your idea and it's your company
6:24
versus a lot of times when you add
6:26
co-founders later
6:27
in their mind it's your company
6:29
it's not their company and even though
6:32
you know you worked on the company an
6:33
extra month than the other person did
6:35
which is so silly right you'll always
6:37
have this like well this wasn't my idea
6:39
this wasn't my company
6:40
um which isn't great from a retention
6:42
perspective if you can both really feel
6:44
like you shepherded the idea through the
6:46
earliest stages you're going to see a
6:48
lot more ownership and people stepping
6:51
up when you go through hard times to
6:52
reiterate what we talked about at the
6:54
beginning
6:55
um
6:57
i don't want to say co-founders are
1. Co-founders are a superpower
6:58
essential
7:00
but man they're so helpful it's such a
7:03
powerful tool
7:05
especially in the hardest part of the
7:06
startup the pre-product market fit
7:08
startup we still encourage everyone to
7:11
have a co-founder
7:12
um but like the startup game right it's
7:15
not about doing it well it's about doing
7:16
it great like having a great co-founder
7:19
can be a super power for your company
7:22
um
7:23
having an okay co-founder not taking
7:25
this seriously
7:27
can be the seed of big problems
7:29
absolutely and sometimes people they end
7:31
up with co-founder issues i'm like well
7:33
i guess i'm just going to quit and start
7:34
a new company and we'll well well it's
7:37
so easy to start a new company and then
7:39
it's like well good luck and then you
7:40
speak to them a year or two later and
7:42
it's
7:42
really hard to get back to where they
7:44
were in the moment and one of the
7:46
regrets is they wish they would have
7:47
spent the time
7:50
to set up the co-founder relationship
7:52
well and choose the right person first
7:53
then think they can just
7:55
blow everything up and get a do-over
7:56
that's just not how life works and so
7:59
the more you can front-load this the
8:00
first time around versus having hard
8:03
earned lessons
8:05
yeah would recommend
8:07
yeah yeah
8:09
so we recommend you get a co-founder we
Recommendations recap
8:11
recommend you do it well
8:14
we recommend that you invest in that
8:15
relationship early
8:18
so that you can survive the fights that
8:19
will inevitably happen
8:21
and
8:22
man grab this superpower like you should
8:25
certainly get a co-founder but
8:28
don't slack
8:30
don't slack off this isn't the place
8:31
where you want to slack off where you
8:32
want to put 50 effort like this is one
8:34
of the most important things you're
8:35
doing in the beginning of the company
8:44
you
