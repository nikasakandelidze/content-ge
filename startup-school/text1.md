all right let's move on to the next one
1:55
so
Note from YC founder
1:57
the yc founder wrote in
1:59
take arguments with your co-founders
2:00
seriously
2:02
it's more likely to kill you than
2:04
anything else what i see with a lot of
Co founder disputes
2:05
co-founder disputes
2:07
is that the relationship has never been
2:08
pressure tested they've just been
2:10
friends they've been like oh yeah we
2:11
we chat all the time and then the first
2:13
time there's a disagreement it's just a
2:15
blow up
2:16
and and the relationship is broken and
2:19
you'll never be able to put the pieces
2:20
back together again versus if it's
2:22
someone you know in a while maybe it
2:24
doesn't seem as shiny but you've already
2:26
had some disagreements you've already
2:27
had the relationship ever ebb and flow
2:29
over years right my best takeaway is
2:31
that
2:32
first you don't always have to come into
1. Pause (Don't have to keep the fight going)
2:34
a resolution
2:36
like if you don't have two people
2:38
engaging
2:39
uh productively you can pause
2:41
you know you don't have to keep the
2:43
fight going yeah and then the second one
1. Stress (How your co-founder deals with it)
2:45
is like understanding how your
2:46
co-founder deals with stress
2:48
like some people deal with stress by
2:50
attacking
2:51
some people deal with stress by
2:52
retreating and like if you understand
2:55
how your co-founder deals with stress
2:56
you can kind of
2:58
better interpret what they're doing
3:00
all right here's the last um
3:02
here's the last comment that ayc founder
Note from YC founder
3:04
wrote in
3:06
i chose a co-founder with whom i could
3:07
not share my honest disagreement
3:10
we didn't know how to fight well or come
3:12
out of those fights better and wiser
3:14
some part of that was conflict avoidance
3:16
on my part and some part of that was him
3:18
fighting dirty
Avoidance
3:20
it's crazy when you speak to founders
3:22
where
3:23
they'll spend eight hours a day with
3:25
someone
3:26
and
3:27
12 hours a day with someone and they'll
3:29
be like
3:31
i haven't spoken to them in a week
3:34
like like wait you know
3:36
and i'm like what what are you guys
3:37
doing all day like you haven't talked to
3:39
him in a week um or i haven't talked to
3:41
him in a month or i haven't had a i've
3:42
had a real conversation with them in a
3:44
year and i think when things get that
3:48
bad
3:50
i would argue there's a point where
3:52
breaking up becomes inevitable
3:55
and the ceo's job is now not
3:57
how to repair the relationship it's
3:59
basically how to
4:01
separate
4:02
in like the most effective and least
4:04
destructive way
4:06
when you talk to folks about this
4:10
they know in their hearts that that's
4:12
what needs to happen but they just can't
4:14
bring themselves to actually do it
4:17
because it
4:18
feels bad
4:19
and so that's what again when you talk
4:21
to these folks they know they know
4:24
that that it makes the right thing for
4:26
the company is is to go their separate
4:28
ways but they for whatever reason
4:31
they're willing to go through years of
4:33
pain or actually reduce the chance the
4:35
startup's going to work than to face
4:37
that head-on it's it's really rough the
4:38
longer this relationship persists in
4:41
this way before there's a breakup
4:44
the worse
4:45
the breakup is going to be like the more
4:47
likely there's litigation they're more
4:49
likely there's
4:51
you know
4:53
one person has vested stock so now your
4:55
cap table's affected like they're all
4:57
these things that get worse by leaving
4:59
it alone
How should the CEO set up a company?
5:01
how should the ceo set up a company so
5:04
that if this battle
5:06
you know if there is a co-founder fight
5:08
it's it's not fatal to the company the
5:10
closest to equal you can get the better
5:12
because it avoids this oh this person
5:14
has 10 percent more so it's their
5:15
company you see all this drama that
5:17
happens over equity split so
5:19
equal is good however here's a pro tip
5:22
for you
5:23
a straight 50 50 deadlock
5:26
is rough and we see that kill companies
5:28
a lot and so it might be reasonable
5:32
for the ceo to have one extra share
5:34
so you effectively have the same
5:36
ownership your equal co-founders but
5:38
that one extra share is you agreeing in
5:40
writing early that in the event of a
5:42
50-50 deadlock
5:46
there's a tiebreaker vote dalton before
5:48
we close
Tactical tips for folks looking for co-founders?
5:49
what are some tactical tips you give
5:50
folks who are looking for co-founders
5:52
now who are extremely early in their
5:54
journey or thinking about starting a
5:55
company
5:57
i hear from a lot of folks starting
5:58
companies where they want to come up
5:59
with the idea first maybe they want to
6:01
raise money first and then they want to
6:03
add a co-founder and i actually think
6:05
that's going about it
6:07
in a less than ideal way and actually
6:09
might cause more problems okay i would
1. Team first
6:12
recommend figuring out who the
6:13
co-founder is first and then if you come
6:15
up with the idea together
6:17
and perhaps you fundraise together then
6:20
you'll have collective ownership that
6:21
it's your idea and it's your company
6:24
versus a lot of times when you add
6:26
co-founders later
6:27
in their mind it's your company
6:29
it's not their company and even though
6:32
you know you worked on the company an
6:33
extra month than the other person did
6:35
which is so silly right you'll always
6:37
have this like well this wasn't my idea
6:39
this wasn't my company
6:40
um which isn't great from a retention
6:42
perspective if you can both really feel
6:44
like you shepherded the idea through the
6:46
earliest stages you're going to see a
6:48
lot more ownership and people stepping
6:51
up when you go through hard times to
6:52
reiterate what we talked about at the
6:54
beginning
6:55
um
6:57
i don't want to say co-founders are
1. Co-founders are a superpower
6:58
essential
7:00
but man they're so helpful it's such a
7:03
powerful tool
7:05
especially in the hardest part of the
7:06
startup the pre-product market fit
7:08
startup we still encourage everyone to
7:11
have a co-founder
7:12
um but like the startup game right it's
7:15
not about doing it well it's about doing
7:16
it great like having a great co-founder
7:19
can be a super power for your company
7:22
um
7:23
having an okay co-founder not taking
7:25
this seriously
7:27
can be the seed of big problems
7:29
absolutely and sometimes people they end
7:31
up with co-founder issues i'm like well
7:33
i guess i'm just going to quit and start
7:34
a new company and we'll well well it's
7:37
so easy to start a new company and then
7:39
it's like well good luck and then you
7:40
speak to them a year or two later and
7:42
it's
7:42
really hard to get back to where they
7:44
were in the moment and one of the
7:46
regrets is they wish they would have
7:47
spent the time
7:50
to set up the co-founder relationship
7:52
well and choose the right person first
7:53
then think they can just
7:55
blow everything up and get a do-over
7:56
that's just not how life works and so
7:59
the more you can front-load this the
8:00
first time around versus having hard
8:03
earned lessons
8:05
yeah would recommend
8:07
yeah yeah
8:09
so we recommend you get a co-founder we
Recommendations recap
8:11
recommend you do it well
8:14
we recommend that you invest in that
8:15
relationship early
8:18
so that you can survive the fights that
8:19
will inevitably happen
8:21
and
8:22
man grab this superpower like you should
8:25
certainly get a co-founder but
8:28
don't slack
8:30
don't slack off this isn't the place
8:31
where you want to slack off where you
8:32
want to put 50 effort like this is one
8:34
of the most important things you're
8:35
doing in the beginning of the company
8:44
you
