# The Squeeze Theorem

Suppose that $$f(x) \\le g(x) \\le h(x)$$ holds for all $$x$$ in some open interval containing $$a$$, except possibly at $$x = a$$ itself. Suppose also that

    $$\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = lim_{x \\to a} h(x) = L$$

Then $$lim_{x \\to a} g(x) = L$$ also. Similar statements hold for left and right limits.
