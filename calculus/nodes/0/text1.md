# An informal definition of limit

If $$f(x)$$ is defined for all $$x$$ near $$a$$, except possibly at $$a$$ itself, and if we can ensure that $$f(x)$$ is as close as we want to $$L$$ by taking $$x$$ close enough to $$a$$, but not equal to $$a$$, we say that the function $$f$$ approaches the limit $$L$$ as $$x$$ approaches $$a$$, and we write

$$\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L$$

This definition is informal because phrases such as *close as* we want and *close enough* are imprecise; their meaning depends on the context.


## Informal definition of left and right limits

If $$f(x)$$ is defined on some interval $$(b, a)$$ extending to the left of $$x = a$$, and if we can ensure that $$f(x)$$ is as close as we want to $$L$$ by taking $$x$$ to the left of $$a$$ and close enough to $$a$$, then we say $$f(x)$$ has left limit $$L$$ at $$x = a$$, and we write

$$\\lim_{x \\to a-} f(x) = L$$

If $$f(x)$$ is defined on some interval $$(a, b)$$ extending to the right of $$x = a$$, and if we can ensure that $$f(x)$$ is as close as we want to $$L$$ by taking $$x$$ to the right of $$a$$ and close enough to $$a$$, then we say $$f(x)$$ has right limit $$L$$ at $$x = a$$, and we write

$$\\lim_{x \\to a+} f(x) = L$$

Note the use of the suffix $$+$$ to denote the approach from the right (the positive side) and the suffix $$-$$ to denote the approach from the left (the negative side).
