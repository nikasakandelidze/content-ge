        "description": "Dig into the psychology of how memories are susceptible to false information and why we shouldn’t treat them as truth.\n\n--\n\nIn a 1990’s study, participants recalled getting lost in a shopping mall as children. Some shared these memories in vivid detail, but there was one problem: none of these people had actually gotten lost in a mall. They produced these false memories after psychologists told them they’d gotten lost and parents confirmed it. So what’s going on? Daniel L. Schacter explores the fallibility of our memory.\n\nLesson by Daniel L.

        "description": "Puzzle through the ethical dilemma of a spouse accused of murder and decide: do you believe your spouse or the evidence?\n\n--\n\nYou’re sitting on the couch, when you hear a knock on the door. The police have arrived to arrest your spouse— for murder. This accusation comes as a total shock, but their fingerprints were found on the murder weapon. Your spouse insists they’re innocent. Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence against them looks damning? Alex Worsnip takes a look at this classic ethical dilemma.\n\nLesson by Alex Worsnip, directed by Emily Howells and Aaron Brady.\n\nThis video was produced in collaboration with the Parr Center for Ethics, housed within the renowned Philosophy Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

        "description": "Explore how sperm whales use an array of complex vocalizations to communicate with each other, hunt, and assess their surroundings. \n\n--\n\nSoon after whaling ships began operating in the North Pacific, an interesting trend emerged. Within just a few years, whalers saw a 58% drop in their successful strikes. Sperm whales had suddenly become harder to kill— they had begun fleeing the boats instead of forming their usual defensive circles. Were whales communicating new strategies to each other? David Gruber and Shane Gero investigate.\n\nLesson by David Gruber and Shane Gero, directed by Anna Benner.\n\nThe recordings of whale codas included in this video were courtesy of Project CETI.

At ground level, the Amazon River and its tributaries weave their path. But above the canopy, bigger waterways are on the move. These flying rivers are almost invisible, but are essential to life on Earth. Iseult Gillespie explores how this crucial system keeps the rainforest alive.\n\nLesson by Iseult Gillespie, directed by Upamanyu Bhattacharyya, Otter Studios.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nCheck out our merch: http://bit.ly/TEDEDShop\n----------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Us\n----------------------------------------------\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTwitter\nPeep us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/TEDEdInstagram\n----------------------------------------------\n\nKeep Learning\n----------------------------------------------\nView full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-largest-river-on-earth-is-actually-in-the-sky-iseult-gillespie\nDig deeper with additional resources: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-largest-river-on-earth-is-actually-in-the-sky-iseult-gillespie/digdeeper\n\nAnimator's website: http://upamanyubhattacharyya.com\nMusic: https://www.campstudio.co\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!
